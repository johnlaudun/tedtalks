I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century  and perhaps in the next        years. But I want to start with my work on romantic love  because that's my most recent work. What I and my colleagues did was put    people  who were madly in love  into a functional MRI brain scanner.    who were madly in love and their love was accepted  and    who were madly in love and they had just been dumped. And so I want to tell you about that first  and then go on into where I think love is going.  What 'tis to love   Shakespeare said. I think our ancestors    I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago. I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last    years of the psychological research and as it turns out  there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love. The first thing that happens is  a person begins to take on what I call   special meaning.  As a truck driver once said to me   The world had a new center  and that center was Mary Anne.  George Bernard Shaw said it differently.  Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another.  And indeed  that's what we do. And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you don't like about them  but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do. As Chaucer said   Love is blind.  In trying to understand romantic love  I decided I would read poetry from all over the world  and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth century China  because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman. It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot    their car is different from every other car in the parking lot. Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party. And in this case  a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat. And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.  I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home  I watched you roll it out.  He became hooked on a sleeping mat  probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain  just like with you and me. But anyway  not only does this person take on special meaning  you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy. As one Polynesian said   I felt like jumping in the sky.  You're up all night. You're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation when things are going well  mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one businessman in New York said to me   Anything she liked  I liked.  Simple. Romantic love is very simple. You become extremely sexually possessive. You know  if you're just sleeping with somebody casually  you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love  you become extremely sexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian purpose to this. The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team. But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving  an intense craving to be with a particular person  not just sexually  but emotionally. It would be nice to go to bed with them  but you want them to call you on the telephone  to invite you out  etc.  to tell you that they love you. The other main characteristic is motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank  and you want this person. And last but not least  it is an obsession. Before I put these people in the MRI machine  I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most important question was always the same. It was   What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person   And indeed  they would say   All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her.  And then  the very last question    I would always have to work myself up to this question  because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say   Would you die for him or her   And  indeed  these people would say  Yes   as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it. So we scanned their brains  looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph  with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity in a lot of brain regions. In fact  one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed  that's exactly what happens. I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion. In fact  I had always thought it was a series of emotions  from very high to very low. But actually  it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind  the wanting part of the mind  the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate  when you want to win that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive. And in fact  I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. You know  if you ask somebody to go to bed with you  and they say   No  thank you   you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly  around the world  people who are rejected in love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs  poems  novels  sculptures  paintings  myths  legends. In over     societies  people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive  the craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it an  intolerable neural itch   and indeed  that's what it is. It keeps bothering you a little bit  like being hungry. The second of these three brain systems is romantic love  that elation  obsession of early love. And the third brain system is attachment  that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long term partner. And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there  looking for a whole range of partners. You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car. It can be focused on nobody. I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time  thereby conserving mating time and energy. And I think that attachment  the third brain system  evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being at least long enough to raise a child together as a team. So with that preamble  I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends. One of the last        years and the other  certainly of the last    years  that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems  lust  romantic love and deep attachment to a partner. The first is women working  moving into the workforce. I've looked at     societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations. Everywhere in the world      out of     of them  women are not only moving into the job market    sometimes very  very slowly  but they are moving into the job market    and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power  health and education. It's very slow. For every trend on this planet  there's a counter trend. We all know of them  but nevertheless    the Arabs say   The dogs may bark  but the caravan moves on.  And  indeed  that caravan is moving on. Women are moving back into the job market. And I say back into the job market  because this is not new. For millions of years  on the grasslands of Africa  women commuted to work to gather their vegetables. They came home with    to    percent of the evening meal. The double income family was the standard. And women were regarded as just as economically  socially and sexually powerful as men. In short  we're really moving forward to the past. Then  women's worst invention was the plow. With the beginning of plow agriculture  men's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors  but then with the industrial revolution and the post industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. In short  they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago         years ago          years ago. We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal. And it's going to have an impact. I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community. I'll say just a couple of things  and then go on to sex and love. There's a lot of gender differences  anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child. I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike. There's much we have in common  but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common. We are    in the words of Ted Hughes   I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead.  But we did not evolve to have the same brain. And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain. I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love. One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk. Women's ability to find the right word rapidly  basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle  when estrogen levels peak. But even at menstruation  they're better than the average man. Women can talk. They've been doing it for a million years  words were women's tools. They held that baby in front of their face  cajoling it  reprimanding it  educating it with words. And  indeed  they're becoming a very powerful force. Even in places like India and Japan  where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market  they're moving into journalism. And I think that the television is like the global campfire. We sit around it and it shapes our minds. Almost always  when I'm on TV  the producer who calls me  who negotiates what we're going to say  is a woman. In fact  Solzhenitsyn once said   To have a great writer is to have another government.  Today    percent of people who are writers in America are women. It's one of many  many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market. They've got incredible people skills  negotiating skills. They're highly imaginative. We now know the brain circuitry of imagination  of long term planning. They tend to be web thinkers. Because the female parts of the brain are better connected  they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think  put them into more complex patterns  see more options and outcomes. They tend to be contextual  holistic thinkers  what I call web thinkers. Men tend to    and these are averages    tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous  focus on what they do  and move in a more step by step thinking pattern. They're both perfectly good ways of thinking. We need both of them to get ahead. In fact  there's many more male geniuses in the world. And there's also many more male idiots in the world. When the male brain works well  it works extremely well. And what I really think that we're doing is  we're moving towards a collaborative society  a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed. But in fact  women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life. Foremost  women are starting to express their sexuality. I'm always astonished when people come to me and say   Why is it that men are so adulterous    Why do you think more men are adulterous than women    Well  men are more adulterous   And I say   Who do you think these men are sleeping with   And    basic math  Anyway. In the Western world  women start sooner at sex  have more partners  express less remorse for the partners that they do  marry later  have fewer children  leave bad marriages in order to get good ones. We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression. And  indeed  once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago  because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today. We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality. They're now saying that the   st century is going to be the century of what they call the  symmetrical marriage   or the  pure marriage   or the  companionate marriage.  This is a marriage between equals  moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit. We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.    percent of American women and    percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner  if they were not in love with that person. People around the world  in a study of    societies  want to be in love with the person that they marry. Indeed  arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life. I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend. The first one being women moving into the job market  the second one being the aging world population. They're now saying that in America  that middle age should be regarded as up to age   . Because in that highest age category of    to     as much as    percent of people have nothing really wrong with them. So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age. For one of my books  I looked at divorce data in    societies. And as it turns out  the older you get  the less likely you are to divorce. So the divorce rate right now is stable in America  and it's actually beginning to decline. It may decline some more. I would even say that with Viagra  estrogen replacement  hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women    women have never been as interesting as they are now. Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated  so interesting  so capable. And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages  that time is now. However  there's always kinds of complications in this. These three brain systems    lust  romantic love and attachment    don't always go together. They can go together  by the way. That's why casual sex isn't so casual. With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine. Dopamine's associated with romantic love  and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. With orgasm  then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin    those are associated with attachment. This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them. But these three brain systems  lust  romantic love and attachment  aren't always connected to each other. You can feel deep attachment to a long term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else  while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners. In short  we're capable of loving more than one person at a time. In fact  you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else. It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do. So I don't think  honestly  we're an animal that was built to be happy  we are an animal that was built to reproduce. I think the happiness we find  we make. And I think  however  we can make good relationships with each other. So I want to conclude with two things. I want to conclude with a worry  and with a wonderful story. The worry is about antidepressants. Over     million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States. And these drugs are going generic. They are seeping around the world. I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants  SSRIs  serotonin enhancing antidepressants    since she was   . She's   . She's been on them ever since she was   . I've got nothing against people who take them short term  when they're going through something horrible. They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else. I would recommend it. But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term. And indeed  what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin. And by raising levels of serotonin  you suppress the dopamine circuit. Everybody knows that. Dopamine is associated with romantic love. Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit  but they kill the sex drive. And when you kill the sex drive  you kill orgasm. And when you kill orgasm  you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment. The things are connected in the brain. And when you tamper with one brain system  you're going to tamper with another. I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place. So now    Thank you. I want to end with a story. And then  just a comment. I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for    years. I'm an identical twin  I am interested in why we're all alike. Why you and I are alike  why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike. And about a year ago  an Internet dating service  Match.com  came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them. I said   I don't know anything about personality. You know  I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person   They said   Yes.  It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another. That's my current project  it will be my next book. There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another. Timing is important. Proximity is important. Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious  in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain  probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love. You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your  love map   an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up. And I also think that you gravitate to certain people  actually  with somewhat complementary brain systems. And that's what I'm now contributing to this. But I want to tell you a story  to illustrate. I've been carrying on here about the biology of love. I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it  too  the magic of it. It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one    probably a true story. It was a graduate student    I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues    Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook. That's where we put our people in the MRI machine. And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student  and she was not in love with him. And they were all at a conference in Beijing. And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody  you can drive up the dopamine in the brain  and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love. So he decided he'd put science to work. And he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him. And sure enough    I've never been in one  but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting. He figured that this would drive up the dopamine  and she'd fall in love with him. So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time. An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw  and she throws her hands up and she says   Wasn't that wonderful   And   Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome   There's magic to love  But I will end by saying that millions of years ago  we evolved three basic drives  the sex drive  romantic love and attachment to a long term partner. These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain. They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called  this mortal coil.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Helen Fisher  I bet you're worried. I was worried. That's why I began this piece. I was worried about vaginas. I was worried what we think about vaginas and even more worried that we don't think about them. I was worried about my own vagina. It needed a context  a culture  a community of other vaginas. There is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them. Like the Bermuda Triangle  nobody ever reports back from there. In the first place  it's not so easy to even find your vagina. Women go days  weeks  months  without looking at it. I interviewed a high powered businesswoman  she told me she didn't have time.  Looking at your vagina   she said   is a full day's work.   You've got to get down there on your back  in front of a mirror  full length preferred. You've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light  which then becomes shadowed by the angle you're at. You're twisting your head up  arching your back  it's exhausting.  She was busy  she didn't have time. So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas. They began as casual vagina interviews  and they turned into vagina monologues. I talked with over     women. I talked to older women  younger women  married women  lesbians  single women. I talked to corporate professionals  college professors  actors  sex workers. I talked to African American women  Asian American women  Native American women  Caucasian women  Jewish women. OK  at first women were a little shy  a little reluctant to talk. Once they got going  you couldn't stop them. Women love to talk about their vaginas  they do. Mainly because no one's ever asked them before. Let's just start with the word  vagina     vagina  vagina. It sounds like an infection  at best. Maybe a medical instrument.  Hurry  nurse  bring the vagina   Vagina  vagina  vagina. It doesn't matter how many times you say the word  it never sounds like a word you want to say. It's a completely ridiculous  totally un sexy word. If you use it during sex  trying to be politically correct   Darling  would you stroke my vagina   you kill the act right there. I'm worried what we call them and don't call them. In Great Neck  New York  they call it a Pussycat. A woman told me there her mother used to tell her   Don't wear panties  dear  underneath your pajamas. You need to air out your Pussycat.  In Westchester  they call it a Pooki  in New Jersey  a twat. There's Powderbox  derriere  a Pooky  a Poochi  a Poopi  a Poopelu  a Pooninana  a Padepachetchki  a Pal  and a Piche. There's Toadie  Dee Dee  Nishi  Dignity  Coochi Snorcher  Cooter  Labbe  Gladys Seagelman  VA  Wee wee  Horsespot  Nappy Dugout  Mongo  Ghoulie  Powderbox  a Mimi in Miami  a Split Knish in Philadelphia ... and a Schmende in the Bronx. I am worried about vaginas. This is how the  Vagina Monologues  begins. But it really didn't begin there. It began with a conversation with a woman. We were having a conversation about menopause  and we got onto the subject of her vagina  which you'll do if you're talking about menopause. And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina    that it was dried up and finished and dead    and I was kind of shocked. So I said to a friend casually   Well  what do you think about your vagina   And that woman said something more amazing  and then the next woman said something more amazing  and before I knew it  every woman was telling me I had to talk to somebody about their vagina because they had an amazing story  and I was sucked down the vagina trail. And I really haven't gotten off of it. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up  and be in shoe stores  and people would scream out   There she is  the Vagina Lady   I don't know that that would have been my life ambition. But I want to talk a little bit about happiness  and the relationship to this whole vagina journey  because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago. I think before I did the  Vagina Monologues   I didn't really believe in happiness. I thought that only idiots were happy  to be honest. I remember when I started practicing Buddhism    years ago  and I was told that the end of this practice was to be happy  I said   How could you be happy and live in this world of suffering and live in this world of pain   I mistook happiness for a lot of other things  like numbness or decadence or selfishness. And what happened through the course of the  Vagina Monologues  and this journey is  I think I have come to understand a little bit more about happiness. There are three qualities I want to talk about. One is seeing what's right in front of you  and talking about it  and stating it. I think what I learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina  is it was the most obvious thing    it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world    and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about. The second thing is that what talking about the vagina did is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better. And that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from. And the third principle of happiness  which I've realized recently  Eight years ago  this momentum and this energy  this  V wave  started    and I can only describe it as a  V wave  because  to be honest  I really don't understand it completely  I feel at the service of it. But this wave started  and if I question the wave  or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave  I often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking. But if I go with the wave  and I trust the wave and I move with the wave  I go to the next place  and it happens logically and organically and truthfully. And I started this piece  particularly with stories and narratives  and I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman. And then I wrote those stories down  and I put them out in front of other people. And every single time I did the show at the beginning  women would literally line up after the show  because they wanted to tell me their stories. And at first I thought   Oh great  I'll hear about wonderful orgasms  and great sex lives  and how women love their vaginas.  But in fact  that's not what women lined up to tell me. What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped  and how they were battered  and how they were beaten  and how they were gang raped in parking lots  and how they were incested by their uncles. And I wanted to stop doing the  Vagina Monologues   because it felt too daunting. I felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events  but doesn't intervene on their behalf. And so in       I said   Let's get women together. What could we do with this information that all these women are being violated   And it turned out  after thinking and investigating  that I discovered    and the UN has actually said this recently    that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime. That's essentially a gender  that's essentially the resource of the planet  which is women. So in      we got all these incredible women together and we said   How can we use the play  this energy  to stop violence against women   And we put on one event in New York City  in the theater  and all these great actors came    from Susan Sarandon  to Glenn Close  to Whoopi Goldberg    and we did one performance on one evening  and that catalyzed this wave  this energy. And within five years  this extraordinary thing began to happen. One woman took that energy and she said   I want to bring this wave  this energy  to college campuses   and so she took the play and she said   Let's use the play and have performances once a year  where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world.  And in one year  it went to    colleges  and then it expanded. And over the course of the last six years  it's spread and it's spread and it's spread around the world. What I have learned is two things  one  that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking  it's global  it is so profound and it is so devastating  and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater  of every little society that we don't even recognize it  because it's become ordinary. This journey has taken me to Afghanistan  where I had the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban. I was dressed in a burqa and I went in with an extraordinary group  called the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. And I saw firsthand how women had been stripped of every single right that was possible to strip women of    from being educated  to being employed  to being actually allowed to eat ice cream. For those of you who don't know  it was illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban. And I actually saw and met women who had been flogged for being caught eating vanilla ice cream. I was taken to the secret ice cream eating place in a little town  where we went to a back room  and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us  and they were served vanilla ice cream. And women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream. And I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment  and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive. It has taken me  this journey  to Islamabad  where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off. It has taken me to Juarez  Mexico  where I was a week ago  where I have literally been there in parking lots  where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to Coca Cola bottles. It has taken me to universities all over this country  where girls are date raped and drugged. I have seen terrible  terrible  terrible violence. But I have also recognized  in the course of seeing that violence  that being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us is the antidote to depression  and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value. Because before the  Vagina Monologues   I will say that    percent of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on in this reality  and that closing off closed off my vitality and my life energy. What has also happened is in the course of these travels    and it's been an extraordinary thing    is that every single place that I have gone to in the world  I have met a new species. And I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea. And I was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel  that it's beneath  beyond and between  and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories. But one of the things I've seen is this species    and it is a species  and it is a new paradigm  and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because I don't think good news ever is news  and I don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows. But every single country I have been to    and in the last six years  I've been to about    countries  and many tiny little villages and cities and towns    I have seen something what I've come to call  vagina warriors.  A  vagina warrior  is a woman  or a vagina friendly man  who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it  and rather than getting an AK    or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete  they hold the violence in their bodies  they grieve it  they experience it  and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else. I have met these women everywhere on the planet  and I want to tell a few stories  because I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information  where it goes into our bodies. And I think one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting is that I live in my body a lot  and I don't live in my head very much anymore. And this is a very heady place. And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days  I've been very disoriented    because I think the world  the V world  is very much in your body. It's a body world  and the species really exists in the body. And I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads  that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose from intent. And the connection between body and head often brings those things into union. I want to talk about three particular people that I've met  vagina warriors  who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species  and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez. Marsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala. She was    years old  and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis. And she couldn't get out  because she was addicted to the relationship  and she had no money. Her sister was younger than her  and she applied    we had a  Stop Rape  contest a few years ago in New York    and she applied  hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister. She did become a finalist  she brought Marsha to New York. And at that time  we did this extraordinary V Day at Madison Square Garden  where we sold out the entire testosterone filled dome           people standing up to say  Yes  to vaginas  which was really a pretty incredible transformation. And she came  and she witnessed this  and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband  and that she would bring V Day to Guatemala. She was    years old. I went to Guatemala and she had sold out the National Theater of Guatemala. And I watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress and high heels  and she stood there and said   My name is Marsha. I was beaten by my husband for five years. He almost murdered me. I left and you can  too.  And the entire       people went absolutely crazy. There's a woman named Esther Ch vez who I met in Juarez  Mexico. And Esther Ch vez was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City. She was    years old and she was planning to retire. She went to Juarez to take care of an ailing aunt  and in the course of it  she began to discover what was happening to the murdered and disappeared women of Juarez. She gave up her life  she moved to Juarez. She started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women.     women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor. There has been no response to the disappearance  and not one person has been held accountable. She began to document it. She opened a center called Casa Amiga  and in six years  she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world. We were there a week ago  when there were       people in the street  and it was truly a miracle. And as we walked through the streets  the people of Juarez  who normally don't even come into the streets  because the streets are so dangerous  literally stood there and wept  to see that other people from the world had showed up for that particular community. There's another woman  named Agnes. And Agnes  for me  epitomizes what a vagina warrior is. I met her three years ago in Kenya. And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl  she was circumcised against her will when she was    years old  and she really made a decision that she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community. So when she got older  she created this incredible thing  it's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body  half a woman's body. And she walked through the Rift Valley  and she had vagina and vagina replacement parts  where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like  and what a mutilated vagina looks like. And in the course of her travel    she walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley  through dust  through sleeping on the ground  because the Maasai are nomads  and she would have to find them  and they would move  and she would find them again    she saved       girls from being cut. And in that time  she created an alternative ritual  which involved girls coming of age without the cut. When we met her three years ago  we said   What could V Day do for you   And she said   Well  if you got me a jeep  I could get around a lot faster.  So we bought her a jeep. And in the year that she had the jeep  she saved       girls from being cut. So we said to her   What else could we do for you   She said   Well  Eve  if you gave me some money  I could open a house and girls could run away  and they could be saved.  And I want to tell this little story about my own beginnings  because it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes. When I was a little girl    I grew up in a wealthy community  it was an upper middle class white community  and it had all the trappings and the looks of a perfectly nice  wonderful  great life. And everyone was supposed to be happy in that community  and  in fact  my life was hell. I lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me  and it was all inside that. And always as a child I had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me. And I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr. Alligator. I would call him up when things got really bad  and say it was time to come and pick me up. And I would pack a little bag and wait for Mr. Alligator to come. Now  Mr. Alligator never did come  but the idea of Mr. Alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it OK for me to keep going  because I believed  in the distance  there would be someone coming to rescue me. Cut to    some odd years later  we go to Kenya  and we're walking  we arrive at the opening of this house. And Agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days  because they were preparing this whole ritual. I want to tell you a great story. When Agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation in her community  she had become an outcast  and she was exiled and slandered  and the whole community turned against her. But being a vagina warrior  she kept going  and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness. And in the Maasai community  goats and cows are the most valued possession. They're like the Mercedes Benz of the Rift Valley. And she said two days before the house opened  two different people arrived to give her a goat each  and she said to me   I knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa.  Anyway  we arrived  and when we arrived  there were hundreds of girls dressed in red homemade dresses    which is the color of the Maasai and the color of V Day    and they greeted us. They had made up these songs that they were singing  about the end of suffering and the end of mutilation  and they walked us down the path. It was a gorgeous day in the African sun  and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing  and there was this house  and it said   V Day Safe House for the Girls.  And it hit me in that moment that it had taken    years  but that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up. And he had shown up  obviously  in a form that it took me a long time to understand  which is that when we give in the world what we want the most  we heal the broken part inside each of us. And I feel  in the last eight years  that this journey    this miraculous vagina journey    has taught me this really simple thing  which is that happiness exists in action  it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is  and it exists in giving away what you want the most. And I feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege  and I feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you. Thank you very much. We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising. So I'll try and do that  but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows. And the first one  in fact  is something that has been known for most of recorded history  and that is  that the planet Earth  or the solar system  or our environment or whatever  is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution    or creation  as it used to be thought    and our present existence  and most important  our future survival. Nowadays  this idea has a dramatic name  Spaceship Earth. And the idea there is that outside the spaceship  the universe is implacably hostile  and inside is all we have  all we depend on  and we only get the one chance  if we mess up our spaceship  we've got nowhere else to go. Now  the second thing that everyone already knows is that  contrary to what was believed for most of human history  human beings are not  in fact  the hub of existence. As Stephen Hawking famously said  we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star  which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy  and so on. Now  the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very un typical place  uniquely suited and so on  and the second one is saying that we're at a typical place. And  especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions  then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other. But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false. And they are. So let me start with the second one   Typical.  Well  is this a typical place  Well  let's look around  you know  look in a random direction  and we see a wall  and chemical scum    and that's not typical of the universe at all. All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back  and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all    all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that  you'll see the Sun  the solar system and the stars and so on  but that's still not typical of the universe  because stars come in galaxies. And most places in the universe  a typical place in the universe  is nowhere near any galaxies. So let's go out further  till we're outside the galaxy  and look back  and yeah  there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us. And at this point  we've come         light years from here. But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe. To get to a typical place  you've got to go       times as far as that  into intergalactic space. And so  what does that look like     typical   What does a  typical  place in the universe look like  Well  at enormous expense  TED has arranged a high resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space. Can we have the lights off  please  so we can see it  Well  not quite  not quite perfect. You see  intergalactic space is completely dark  pitch dark. It's so dark  that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you  and that star were to explode as a supernova  and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you  you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer. That's how big and how dark the universe is. And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright  so brilliant an event  that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years. And yet  from intergalactic space  it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. It's also very cold out there    less than three degrees above absolute zero. And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create. So that's how different a typical place is from this place. And that is how un typical this place is. So can we have the lights back on please  Thank you. Now  how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to  Well  the Earth    our environment  in the form of us    is creating knowledge. Well  what does that mean  Well  look out even further than we've just been    I mean from here  with a telescope    and you'll see things that look like stars  they're called quasars.  Quasars  originally meant  quasi stellar object   which means  things that look a bit like stars.  But they're not stars. And we know what they are. Billions of years ago and billions of light years away  the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super massive black hole. And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets  which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of    I think it's a trillion    suns. Now  the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet. We couldn't survive for an instant in it. Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets. It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion  but at point blank range and for millions of years at a time. And yet  that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later  on the other side of the universe  some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain  above all    there's your reference    what was happening there  in reality. The one physical system  the brain  contains an accurate working model of the other  the quasar. Not just a superficial image of it  though it contains that as well  but an explanatory model  embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure. Now  that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough  the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge. So  the laws of physics have this special property  that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be  can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time. So we are a chemical scum that is different. This chemical scum has universality. Its structure contains  with ever increasing precision  the structure of everything. This place  and not other places in the universe  is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality. And so  far from being insignificant  the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen  is one of the most important things about the physical world. Now how does the solar system    our environment  in the form of us    acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe  Well  one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark    I mean  it is true  but it's the wrong emphasis. One thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics  there's no special dispensation  no miracles involved. It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance. One of them is matter  because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing. Information processing is computation  computation requires a computer    there's no known way of making a computer without matter. We also need energy to make the computer  and most important  to make the media  in effect  onto which we record the knowledge that we discover. And then thirdly  less tangible but just as essential for the open ended creation of knowledge  of explanations  is evidence. Now  our environment is inundated with evidence. We happen to get round to testing  let's say  Newton's Law of Gravity  about     years ago. But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that  and will continue to fall for billions of years afterwards. And the same is true for all the other sciences. As far as we know  evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking  on our planet. Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy. Out in intergalactic space  those three prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply    as I said  it's empty  it's cold and it's dark out there. Or is it  Now actually  that's just another parochial misconception. Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space  the same size as our home  the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards  but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter. And a million tons is enough to make  say  a self contained space station  on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open ended stream of knowledge  and so on. Now  it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on. But the thing is  in a comprehensible universe  if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics  then what could possibly prevent us from doing it  other than knowing how  In other words  it's a matter of knowledge  not resources. If we could do that  we'd automatically have an energy supply  because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor. And evidence  Well  again  it's dark out there to human senses  but all you've got to do is take a telescope  even one of present day design  look out  and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here. And with a more powerful telescope  you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies  you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics. And locally there you could build particle accelerators  and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry  and so on. Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips    because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life bearing planet and back. But I have to tell you    and sorry  Richard    but I never did like biology field trips much  and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years. So in fact  intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge. Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are  if the knowledge of how to do so were present there. So  we're not in a uniquely hospitable place. If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open ended stream of explanations  then so is almost every other environment  so is the Earth. So is a polluted Earth. And the limiting factor  there and here  is not resources  because they're plentiful  but knowledge  which is scarce. Now this cosmic knowledge based view may    and I think ought to    make us feel very special. But it should also make us feel vulnerable  because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe  we won't survive them. All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away  and we'll all be dead  Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things  from astrophysics  to scientific experiments gone wrong  and most importantly  to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction. And he thinks that civilization has only a    percent chance of surviving this century. I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference. Now  I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in  but I do agree with him about this  We can survive and we can fail to survive. But it depends not on chance  but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time. The danger is not at all unprecedented. Species go extinct all the time. Civilizations end. The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history. And if we want to be the exception to that  then logically  our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others    namely  our special relationship with the laws of physics  our ability to create new explanations  new knowledge    to be a hub of existence. So let me now apply this to a current controversy  not because I want to advocate any particular solution  but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean. And the controversy is global warming. Now  I'm a physicist  but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming  I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory. And according to that theory  it's already too late to avoid a disaster  because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO  emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol  with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars  or whatever it is  then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure. And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem  merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it  and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger. It was probably already too late in the     s  when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age  in which billions would die. Now  the lesson of that seems clear to me  and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate. It is that we can't always know. When we know of an impending disaster  and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself  then there's not going to be much argument  really. But no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee. Hence  we need a stance of problem fixing  not just problem avoidance. And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure  but that's only if we know what to prevent. If you've been punched on the nose  then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches. If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only  then it would achieve very little of either. The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs. It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature  and with plans to live at the higher temperature    and not at all costs  but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist  things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away  and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide. At the moment  these things are fringe research  they're not central to the human effort to face this problem  or problems in general. And with problems that we are not aware of yet  the ability to put right    not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely    is our only hope  not just of solving problems  but of survival. So take two stone tablets  and carve on them. On one of them  carve   Problems are soluble.  And on the other one  carve   Problems are inevitable.  Thank you. My title   Queerer than we can suppose  the strangeness of science.   Queerer than we can suppose  comes from J.B.S. Haldane  the famous biologist  who said   Now  my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose  but queerer than we can suppose. I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of  or can be dreamed of  in any philosophy.  Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories    experimental predictions    to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy. This means that quantum theory has got to be  in some sense  true. Yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even Feynman himself was moved to remark   If you think you understand quantum theory  you don't understand quantum theory.  It's so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it. David Deutsch  who's talking here  in  The Fabric of Reality   embraces the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory  because the worst that you can say about it is that it's preposterously wasteful. It postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel  mutually undetectable  except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments. And that's Richard Feynman. The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example. Science  as opposed to technology  does violence to common sense. Every time you drink a glass of water  he points out  the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell. It's just elementary probability theory. The number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls  or bladdersful  in the world. And of course  there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders    you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree.  Queerer than we can suppose.  What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything  and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose  Are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp  but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence  Are there things about the universe that are  in principle  ungraspable by any mind  however superior  The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms  as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe. We're now so used to the idea that the Earth spins  rather than the Sun moves across the sky  it's hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must have been. After all  it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless  the Sun  small and mobile. But it's worth recalling Wittgenstein's remark on the subject   Tell me   he asked a friend   why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the Sun went 'round the Earth  rather than that the Earth was rotating   And his friend replied   Well  obviously  because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth.  Wittgenstein replied   Well  what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating   Science has taught us  against all intuition  that apparently solid things  like crystals and rocks  are really almost entirely composed of empty space. And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium  and the next atom is in the next sports stadium. So it would seem the hardest  solidest  densest rock is really almost entirely empty space  broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn't count. Why  then  do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable  As an evolutionary biologist  I'd say this  our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude  of size and speed which our bodies operate at. We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms. If we had  our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space. Rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands  precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other. It's therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like  solidity  and  impenetrability   because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle sized world in which we have to navigate. Moving to the other end of the scale  our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light. If they had  our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein. I want to give the name  Middle World  to the medium scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act    nothing to do with  Middle Earth     Middle World. We are evolved denizens of Middle World  and that limits what we are capable of imagining. We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like  when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move  and hits another Middle World object like a rock  it knocks itself out. May I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III  commander of military intelligence in     .  ... He  stared at his wall in Arlington  Virginia  and decided to do it. As frightening as the prospect was  he was going into the next office. He stood up and moved out from behind his desk. 'What is the atom mostly made of ' he thought  'Space.' He started walking. 'What am I mostly made of  Atoms.' He quickened his pace  almost to a jog now. 'What is the wall mostly made of ' 'Atoms ' All I have to do is merge the spaces. Then  General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office. Stubblebine  who commanded        soldiers  was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall. He has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal. Who would screw around with an army that could do that   That's from an article in Playboy  which I was reading the other day. I have every reason to think it's true  I was reading Playboy because I  myself  had an article in it. Unaided human intuition  schooled in Middle World  finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object  air friction aside  would hit the ground at the same instant. And that's because in Middle World  air friction is always there. If we'd evolved in a vacuum  we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously. If we were bacteria  constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules  it would be different. But we Middle Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion. In the same way  our lives are dominated by gravity  but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension. A small insect would reverse these priorities. Steve Grand    he's the one on the left  Douglas Adams is on the right. Steve Grand  in his book   Creation  Life and How to Make It   is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself. We have this tendency to think that only solid  material things are really things at all. Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal. Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium  the ether. But we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in Middle World  where matter is a useful fiction. A whirlpool  for Steve Grand  is a thing with just as much reality as a rock. In a desert plain in Tanzania  in the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai  there's a dune made of volcanic ash. The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily. It's what's technically known as a  barchan   and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about    meters per year. It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns. What happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope on the other side  and then  as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge  it cascades down on the inside of the crescent  and so the whole horn shaped dune moves. Steve Grand points out that you and I are  ourselves  more like a wave than a permanent thing. He invites us  the reader  to think of an experience from your childhood  something you remember clearly  something you can see  feel  maybe even smell  as if you were really there. After all  you really were there at the time  weren't you  How else would you remember it  But here is the bombshell  You weren't there. Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place. Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. Whatever you are  therefore  you are not the stuff of which you are made. If that doesn't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck  read it again until it does  because it is important. So  really  isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence. If a neutrino had a brain  which it evolved in neutrino sized ancestors  it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space. We have brains that evolved in medium sized ancestors which couldn't walk through rocks.  Really   for an animal  is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival. And because different species live in different worlds  there will be a discomforting variety of  reallys.  What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world  but a model of the world  regulated and adjusted by sense data  but constructed so it's useful for dealing with the real world. The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are. A flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking  climbing or swimming animal. A monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating a three dimensional world of branches and trunks. A mole's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use. A water strider's brain doesn't need  D software at all  since it lives on the surface of the pond  in an Edwin Abbott flatland. I've speculated that bats may see color with their ears. The world model that a bat needs in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird    a day flying bird like a swallow    needs to perform the same kind of tasks. The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model  while the swallow uses light  is incidental. Bats  I've even suggested  use perceived hues  such as red and blue  as labels  internal labels  for some useful aspect of echoes    perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces  furry or smooth and so on    in the same way as swallows or indeed  we  use those perceived hues    redness and blueness  etc.    to label long and short wavelengths of light. There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength. The point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used  rather than by the sensory modality involved. J.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell. Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids  extremely diluted  caprylic acid and caproic acid. The only difference  you see  is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain. Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells  just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes. Now  there's another fatty acid  capric acid  which is just like the other two  except that it has two more carbon atoms. A dog that had never met capric acid would  perhaps  have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet  say  playing one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before. Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell oriented animals smell in color. And the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats. Middle World    the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with    is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors. We're blind to all frequencies outside that  unless we use instruments to help us. Middle World is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal  as opposed to the queerness of the very small  the very large and the very fast. We could make a similar scale of improbabilities  nothing is totally impossible. Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable. A marble statue could wave its hand at us  the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway. Because there are so many of them  and because there's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement  the marble  as we see it in Middle World  stays rock steady. But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time  and again and again. In this case  the hand would move  and we'd see it waving at us in Middle World. The odds against it  of course  are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe  you still would not have written enough zeros to this day. Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle very improbable events  we don't live long enough. In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time  that which seems impossible in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable. One way to think about that is by counting planets. We don't know how many planets there are in the universe  but a good estimate is about    to the     or     billion billion. And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability. We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability  which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at. If life has arisen only once on any    life could originate once per planet  could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe  in which case it would have to be here. And somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince  and similar magical things like that. If life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe  that planet has to be our planet  because here we are talking about it. And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it  we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in     billion billion. I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that  because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe. And when I say quite common  it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another  which is a sad thought. How shall we interpret  queerer than we can suppose   Queerer than can in principle be supposed  or just queerer than we can suppose  given the limitations of our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World  Could we  by training and practice  emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large  I genuinely don't know the answer. I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand  say  quantum theory  if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood  which had a make believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen  a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer's make believe  so that they became familiar on the Middle World scale of the stream. And similarly  a relativistic computer game  in which objects on the screen manifest the Lorentz contraction  and so on  to try to get ourselves    to get children into the way of thinking about it. I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World to our perceptions of each other. Most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind  we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are  our hormones are the way they are. We'd be different  our characters would be different  if our neuro anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different. But we scientists are inconsistent. If we were consistent  our response to a misbehaving person  like a child murderer  should be something like  this unit has a faulty component  it needs repairing. That's not what we say. What we say    and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us  which is probably me    what we say is   Vile monster  prison is too good for you.  Or worse  we seek revenge  in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter revenge  which we see  of course  all over the world today. In short  when we're thinking like academics  we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines  like computers or cars. But when we revert to being human  we behave more like Basil Fawlty  who  we remember  thrashed his car to teach it a lesson  when it wouldn't start on  Gourmet Night.  The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension dominated flatland  we live in a social world. We swim through a sea of people    a social version of Middle World. We are evolved to second guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant  intuitive psychologists. Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate  but it's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next. The economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful  goal seeking agent with pleasures and pains  desires and intentions  guilt  blame worthiness. Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans  it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate  like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people  with the universe as a whole. If the universe is queerer than we can suppose  is it just because we've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa  Or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution  Or finally  are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy of beings  however godlike  could dream them  Thank you very much. I think I was supposed to talk about my new book  which is called  Blink   and it's about snap judgments and first impressions. And it comes out in January  and I hope you all buy it in triplicate. But I was thinking about this  and I realized that although my new book makes me happy  and I think would make my mother happy  it's not really about happiness. So I decided instead  I would talk about someone who I think has done as much to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last    years  a man who is a great personal hero of mine  someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz  who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce. Howard's about this high  and he's round  and he's in his   s  and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair  and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality  and he has a parrot  and he loves the opera  and he's a great aficionado of medieval history. And by profession  he's a psychophysicist. Now  I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is  although at some point in my life  I dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics. Which should tell you something about that relationship. As far as I know  psychophysics is about measuring things. And Howard is very interested in measuring things. And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard  and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains  New York. And one of his first clients was Pepsi. This is many years ago  back in the early   s. And Pepsi came to Howard and they said   You know  there's this new thing called aspartame  and we would like to make Diet Pepsi. We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink.  Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer  and that's what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him   We're working with a band between eight and    percent. Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough  anything above    percent sweetness is too sweet. We want to know  what's the sweet spot between   and      Now  if I gave you this problem to do  you would all say  it's very simple. What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi  at every degree of sweetness    eight percent   .    .    .   all the way up to       and we try this out with thousands of people  and we plot the results on a curve  and we take the most popular concentration  right  Really simple. Howard does the experiment  and he gets the data back  and he plots it on a curve  and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve. In fact  the data doesn't make any sense. It's a mess. It's all over the place. Now  most people in that business  in the world of testing food and such  are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess. They think   Well  you know  figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy.   You know  maybe we made an error somewhere along the way.   You know  let's just make an educated guess   and they simply point and they go for    percent  right in the middle. Howard is not so easily placated. Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards. And this was not good enough for him  and this question bedeviled him for years. And he would think it through and say   What was wrong  Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi   And one day  he was sitting in a diner in White Plains  about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescaf . And suddenly  like a bolt of lightning  the answer came to him. And that is  that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data  they were asking the wrong question. They were looking for the perfect Pepsi  and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis. Trust me. This was an enormous revelation. This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science. Howard immediately went on the road  and he would go to conferences around the country  and he would stand up and say   You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi. You're wrong. You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis.  And people would look at him blankly and say   What are you talking about  Craziness.  And they would say   Move  Next   Tried to get business  nobody would hire him    he was obsessed  though  and he talked about it and talked about it. Howard loves the Yiddish expression  To a worm in horseradish  the world is horseradish.  This was his horseradish. He was obsessed with it  And finally  he had a breakthrough. Vlasic Pickles came to him  and they said   Doctor Moskowitz  we want to make the perfect pickle.  And he said   There is no perfect pickle  there are only perfect pickles.  And he came back to them and he said   You don't just need to improve your regular  you need to create zesty.  And that's where we got zesty pickles. Then the next person came to him  Campbell's Soup. And this was even more important. In fact  Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation. Campbell's made Prego  and Prego  in the early   s  was struggling next to Rag   which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the   s and   s. In the industry    I don't know whether you care about this  or how much time I have to go into this. But it was  technically speaking    this is an aside    Prego is a better tomato sauce than Rag . The quality of the tomato paste is much better  the spice mix is far superior  it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way. In fact  they would do the famous bowl test back in the   s with Rag  and Prego. You'd have a plate of spaghetti  and you would pour it on  right  And the Rag  would all go to the bottom  and the Prego would sit on top. That's called  adherence.  And  anyway  despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence  and the quality of their tomato paste  Prego was struggling. So they came to Howard  and they said  fix us. And Howard looked at their product line  and he said  what you have is a dead tomato society. So he said  this is what I want to do. And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen  and he made    varieties of spaghetti sauce. And he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce  by sweetness  by level of garlic  by tomatoey ness  by tartness  by sourness  by visible solids    my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business. Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce  he varied spaghetti sauce. And then he took this whole raft of    spaghetti sauces  and he went on the road. He went to New York  to Chicago  he went to Jacksonville  to Los Angeles. And he brought in people by the truckload into big halls. And he sat them down for two hours  and over the course of that two hours  he gave them ten bowls. Ten small bowls of pasta  with a different spaghetti sauce on each one. And after they ate each bowl  they had to rate  from   to      how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was. At the end of that process  after doing it for months and months  he had a mountain of data about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce. And then he analyzed the data. Did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce  No  Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing. Instead  he looked at the data  and he said  let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters. Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas. And sure enough  if you sit down  and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce  you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups. There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain  there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy  and there are people who like it extra chunky. And of those three facts  the third one was the most significant  because at the time  in the early     s  if you went to a supermarket  you would not find extra chunky spaghetti sauce. And Prego turned to Howard  and they said   You're telling me that one third of Americans crave extra chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs   And he said  Yes   And Prego then went back  and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce  and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country. And over the next    years  they made     million dollars off their line of extra chunky sauces. Everyone else in the industry looked at Howard had done  and they said   Oh my god  We've been thinking all wrong   And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar  and    different kinds of mustard  and    different kinds of olive oil. And then eventually even Rag  hired Howard  and Howard did the exact same thing for Rag  that he did for Prego. And today  if you go to a really good supermarket  do you know how many Rag s there are      In six varieties  Cheese  Light  Robusto  Rich   Hearty  Old World Traditional    Extra Chunky Garden. That's Howard's doing. That is Howard's gift to the American people. Now why is that important  It is  in fact  enormously important. I'll explain to you why. What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy. Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat  what will make people happy  is to ask them. And for years and years and years  Rag  and Prego would have focus groups  and they would sit you down  and they would say   What do you want in a spaghetti sauce  Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce.  And for all those years           years    through all those focus group sessions  no one ever said they wanted extra chunky. Even though at least a third of them  deep in their hearts  actually did. People don't know what they want  As Howard loves to say   The mind knows not what the tongue wants.  It's a mystery  And a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want  deep down. If I asked all of you  for example  in this room  what you want in a coffee  you know what you'd say  Every one of you would say   I want a dark  rich  hearty roast.  It's what people always say when you ask them.  What do you like    Dark  rich  hearty roast   What percentage of you actually like a dark  rich  hearty roast  According to Howard  somewhere between    and    percent of you. Most of you like milky  weak coffee. But you will never  ever say to someone who asks you what you want that  I want a milky  weak coffee.  So that's number one thing that Howard did. Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize    it's another very critical point    he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call  horizontal segmentation.  Why is this critical  Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard. What were they obsessed with in the early   s  They were obsessed with mustard. In particular  they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon. Used to be  there were two mustards  French's and Gulden's. What were they  Yellow mustard. What's in it  Yellow mustard seeds  turmeric  and paprika. That was mustard. Grey Poupon came along  with a Dijon. Right  Much more volatile brown mustard seed  some white wine  a nose hit  much more delicate aromatics. And what do they do  They put it in a little tiny glass jar  with a wonderful enameled label on it  made it look French  even though it's made in Oxnard  California. And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight ounce bottle  the way that French's and Gulden's did  they decided to charge four dollars. And they had those ads. With the guy in the Rolls Royce  eating the Grey Poupon. Another pulls up  and says   Do you have any Grey Poupon   And the whole thing  after they did that  Grey Poupon takes off  Takes over the mustard business  And everyone's take home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive  something to aspire to. It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now  and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy. A better mustard  A more expensive mustard  A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning. And Howard looked to that and said   That's wrong   Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy. Mustard exists  just like tomato sauce  on a horizontal plane. There is no good mustard or bad mustard. There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard. There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people. He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste. And for that  as well  we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks. Third thing that Howard did  and perhaps the most important  is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish. What do I mean by that  For the longest time in the food industry  there was a sense that there was one way  a perfect way  to make a dish. You go to Chez Panisse  they give you the red tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction. They don't give you five options on the reduction. They don't say   Do you want the extra chunky reduction  or ...   No  You just get the reduction. Why  Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red tail sashimi.  This is the way it ought to be.  And she serves it that way time and time again  and if you quarrel with her  she will say   You know what  You're wrong  This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant.  Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well. They had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was. And where did that come from  It came from Italy. Italian tomato sauce is what  It's blended  it's thin. The culture of tomato sauce was thin. When we talked about  authentic tomato sauce  in the     s  we talked about Italian tomato sauce  we talked about the earliest Rag s  which had no visible solids  right  Which were thin  you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta. That's what it was. And why were we attached to that  Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce  A. And B  we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce  then they would embrace it. And that's what would please the maximum number of people. In other words  people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were looking for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals  because all of science  through the   th century and much of the   th  was obsessed with universals. Psychologists  medical scientists  economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that changed  right  What is the great revolution in science of the last        years  It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability. Now in medical science  we don't want to know  necessarily  just how cancer works  we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying   This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce.  And for that  we owe him a great vote of thanks. I'll give you one last illustration of variability  and that is    oh  I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that  but he took it a second step  which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food  we aren't just making an error  we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee. And coffee is something he did a lot of work with  with Nescaf . If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee    a type of coffee  a brew    that made all of you happy  and then I asked you to rate that coffee  the average score in this room for coffee would be about    on a scale of   to    . If  however  you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters  maybe three or four coffee clusters  and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters  your scores would go from    to    or   . The difference between coffee at    and coffee at    is a difference between coffee that makes you wince  and coffee that makes you deliriously happy. That is the final  and I think most beautiful lesson  of Howard Moskowitz  that in embracing the diversity of human beings  we will find a surer way to true happiness. Thank you. You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy  but other people's tragedy. It's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy than your own  and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference. So  if you believe the media accounts  being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life  in the words of Virginia Postrel. There was money  there was drugs  guns  women  you know  you name it    jewelry  bling bling    it had it all. What I'm going to tell you today is that  in fact  based on    years of research  a unique opportunity to go inside a gang    to see the actual books  the financial records of the gang    that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life. But I think  more realistically  that being in a gang    selling drugs for a gang    is perhaps the worst job in all of America. And that's what I'd like to convince you of today. So there are three things I want to do. First  I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner city gangs. Secondly  I want to tell you how somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang    an interesting story  I think. And then third  I want to tell you  in a very superficial way  about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records  the books  of the gang. So before I do that  just one warning  which is that this presentation has been rated 'R' by the Motion Picture Association of America. It contains adult themes  adult language. Given who is up on the stage  you'll be delighted to know that  in fact  there'll be no nudity    Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside. So let me start by talking about crack cocaine  and how it transformed the gang. To do that  you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine  in the early '  s  and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader. Being a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid '  s    the early '  s  let me say. Now  you had a lot of power  and you got to beat people up    you got a lot of prestige  a lot of respect. But the thing is  there was no money in it. The gang had no way to make money. You couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang  because the people in the gang didn't have any money. You couldn't really make any money selling marijuana    marijuana's too cheap  it turns out. You can't get rich selling marijuana. You couldn't sell cocaine  cocaine's a great product    powdered cocaine    but you've got to know rich white people. And most of the inner city gang members didn't know any rich white people  so couldn't sell to that market. You couldn't really do petty crime  either. Turns out  petty crime's a terrible way to make a living. As a result  as a gang leader  you had  you know  power    it's a pretty good life    but the thing was  in the end  you were living at home with your mother. And so it wasn't really a career. There were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother. Then along comes crack cocaine. And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell  crack cocaine was the extra chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city. Because crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation. I don't have time to talk about it today  but if you think about it  I would say that in the last    years  of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country  the biggest one in terms of impact on the well being of people who live in the inner city  was crack cocaine. And for the worse    not for the better  but for the worse. It had a huge impact on life. So what was it about crack cocaine  It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high. Because you could smoke crack cocaine    you can't smoke powdered cocaine    and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it. And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine  but when it came  it really did. And it was a perfect drug  you could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar  sell it for five dollars. Highly addictive    the high was very short. So for fifteen minutes  you get this great high  and then when you come down  all you want to do is get high again. It created a wonderful market. And for the people who were there running the gang  it was a great way  seemingly  to make a lot of money. At least for the people on the top. So this is where we enter the picture. Not really me    I'm really a bit player in all this. My co author  Sudhir Venkatesh  is the main character. He was a math major in college who had a good heart  and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD  came to the University of Chicago. Now  the three months before he came to Chicago  he had spent following the Grateful Dead. And in his own words  he  looked like a freak.  He's a South Asian    very dark skinned South Asian. Big man  and he had hair  in his words   down to his ass.  Defied all kinds of boundaries  Was he black or white  Was he man or woman  He was really a curious sight to be seen. So he showed up at the University of Chicago  and the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson was doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago. He took one look at Sudhir  who was going to go do some surveys for him  and decided he knew exactly the place to send him  which was to one of the toughest  most notorious housing projects not just in Chicago  but in the entire United States. So Sudhir  the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city  dutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project  gets to the first building. The first building  Well  there's nobody there. But he hears some voices up in the stairwell  so he climbs up the stairwell  comes around the corner  and finds a group of young African American men playing dice. This is about       peak of the crack epidemic. This is a very dangerous job  being in a gang. You don't like to be surprised. You don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner. And the mantra was  shoot first  ask questions later. Now  Sudhir was lucky    he was such a freak  and that clipboard probably saved his life  because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard. So his greeting was not particularly warm  but they did say  well  OK    let's hear your questions on your survey. So    I kid you not    the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was   How do you feel about being poor and Black in America   Makes you wonder about academics. So the choice of answers were   A  Very Good B  Good C  Bad D  Very Bad  What Sudhir found out is  in fact  that the real answer was the following   A  Very Good B  Good C  Bad D  Very Bad E  Fuck you  The survey was not  in the end  going to be what got Sudhir off the hook. He was held hostage overnight in the stairwell. There was a lot of gunfire  there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members. By morning  the gang leader arrived  checked out Sudhir  decided he was no threat  and they let him go home. So Sudhir went home  took a shower  took a nap. And you and I  probably  faced with the situation  would think   I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead  I've been following them for the last three months.  Sudhir  on the other hand  got right back  walked down to the housing project  went up to the second floor  and said   Hey  guys  I had so much fun hanging out with you last night  I wonder if I could do it again tonight.  And that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for    years  hanging out in crack houses  going to jail with the gang members  having the windows shot out of his car  having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks    you name it. But ultimately  the story has a happy ending for Sudhir  who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country. And especially for me  as I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open  waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang. It was one of the most unequal co authoring relationships ever    But I was glad to be the beneficiary of it. So what did we find  What did we find in the gang  Well  let me say one thing  We really got access to everybody in the gang. We got an inside look at the gang  from the very bottom up to the very top. They trusted Sudhir  in ways that really no academic has ever    or really anybody  any outsider    has ever earned the trust of these gangs  to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me    their books  the financial records they kept. They made them available to us  and we not only could study them  but we could ask them questions about what was in them. So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is  it's that  if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization  it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's  in a lot of different respects    the restaurant McDonald's. So first  in one way  which isn't maybe the most interesting way  but it's a good way to start    is in the way it's organized  the hierarchy of the gang  the way it looks. So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like. I don't know if you know much about org charts  but if you were to assign a stripped down and simplified McDonald's org chart  this is exactly what it would look like. It's amazing  but the top level of the gang  they actually call themselves the  Board of Directors.  And Sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view of what happened in American corporate life  but they had seen movies like  Wall Street   and they had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world. Now  below that board of directors  you've got essentially what are regional VPs    people who control  say  the South Side of Chicago  or the West Side of Chicago. Sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the Iowa franchise  which  it turned out  for this black gang  was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook. But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees. The guys who are running the local gangs    the four square block by four square block areas    they're just like the guys  in some sense  who are running the McDonald's. They are the entrepreneurs. They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug selling. They get the name of the gang behind them  for merchandising and marketing. And they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit  depending on how good they are at running the business. Now  the group I really want you to think about  though  are the ones at the bottom    the foot soldiers. These are the teenagers  typically  who'd be standing out on the street corner  selling the drugs. Extremely dangerous work. And important to note is that almost all of the weight  all of the people in this organization are at the bottom    just like McDonald's. So in some sense  the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's  and it's not just by chance that they're like them. In fact  in these neighborhoods  they'd be the same people. So the same kids who are working in the gang were actually  at the very same time  typically working part time at a place like McDonald's. Which already foreshadows the main result that I've talked about  about what a crappy job it was  being in the gang. Because obviously  if being in the gang were such a wonderful  lucrative job  why in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's  So what do the wages look like  You might be surprised. But based on being able to talk to them and to see their records  this is what it looks like in terms of the wages. The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was   .   an hour. It was below the minimum wage. And this is well documented. It's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have. It really is not fiction    it's fact. There was very little money in the gang  especially at the bottom. Now if you managed to rise up  say  and be that local leader  the guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee  you'd be making         dollars a year. And that  in some ways  was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male. If you managed to rise to the very top          or         dollars a year is what you'd hope to make. Truly  you would be a great success story. And one of the sad parts of this is that  indeed  among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities    this is what they were striving for. They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways  because there were no legitimate channels out. This was the best way out. And it actually was the right choice  probably  to try to make it out this way. You look at this  the relationship to McDonald's breaks down here. The money looks about the same. Why is it such a bad job  Well  the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time. So  with shooting at you  what are the death rates  We found  in our gang    and admittedly  this was not really a standard situation  this was a time of intense violence  of a lot of gang wars  as this gang actually became quite successful. But there were costs. And so the death rate    not to mention the rate of being arrested  sent to prison  being wounded    the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year. You're in the gang for four years  you expect to die with about a    percent likelihood. That is about as high as you can get. So for comparison's purposes  let's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky. Let's say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder  and you're sent to death row. It turns out  the death rates on death row from all causes  including execution  two percent a year. So it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street. That gives you some pause  for those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime. To give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack    and I'm not really focusing on the negatives  but really  there's another story to tell you there    if you look at the death rates just of random  young black males growing up in the inner city in the United States  the death rates during crack were about one percent. That's extremely high. And this is violent death    it's unbelievable  in some sense. To put it into perspective  if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq  for instance  right now fighting the war   .  percent. So in some very literal way  the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war zone  very much in the sense that the soldiers over in Iraq are fighting in a war. So why in the world  you might ask  would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for   .   an hour  with a    percent chance of dying over the next four years  Why would they do that  And I think there are a couple answers. I think the first one is that they got fooled by history. It used to be the gang was a rite of passage  that the young people controlled the gang  that as you got older  you dropped out of the gang. So what happened was  the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time    the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid to late '  s    became very  very wealthy. And so the logical thing to think was that they are going to age out of the gang like everybody else has  and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth. There are striking similarities  I think  to the Internet boom. The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very  very rich. And then all of my friends said   Maybe I should go do that  too.  And they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came. In some sense  that's what happened  exactly  to the set of people we were looking at. They were willing to start at the bottom  just like  say  a first year lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom  work    hour weeks for not that much money  because they think they're going to make partner. But the rules changed  and they never got to make partner. Indeed  the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late     s are still running the major gangs in Chicago today. They never passed on any of the wealth  So everybody got stuck at that   .   an hour job  and it turned out to be a disaster. The other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery. And so for instance  one thing the gang would do is    the gang leaders would have big entourages  and they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry. So what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more  is that  really  they didn't own those cars    they just leased them  because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars. And they didn't really have gold jewelry  they had gold plated jewelry. It goes back to  you know  the real real versus the fake real. And really  they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be. So for instance  they would give a    year old kid a whole roll of bills to hold. That    year old kid would say to his friends   Hey  look at all the money I got in the gang.  It wasn't his money    until he spent it  and then he was in debt to the gang  and was sort of an indentured servant for a while. So I have a couple minutes. Let me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do  which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics  from the study of the gang. So  economists tend to talk in technical words. Often  our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data  but what's kind of interesting is that in this setting  it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy  in some sense  because it's unfettered capitalism. Here's an economic principle. This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics  called a  compensating differential.  It's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks  one which is more unpleasant than the other. Compensating differential    it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more than people who work in parks. The words of one of the members of the gang  I think  make this clear. So it turns out    I'm sort of getting ahead of myself    it turns out  in the gang  when there's a war going on  they actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money. It's exactly this concept. Because they're not willing to be at risk. And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely  he says   Would you stand around here when all this shit ...     the shooting     ... if all this shit's going on  No  right  So if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line  then front me the cash  man.  I think the gang member says it much more articulately than the economist  about what's going on. Here's another one. Economists talk about game theory  that every two person game has a Nash equilibrium. Here's the translation you get from the gang member. They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot    One thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang  if you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang's territory    people are afraid to go buy drugs there  they're going to come into your neighborhood. Here's what he says about why they don't do that   If we start shooting around there  the other gang's territory  nobody  I mean  you dig it  nobody gonna step on their turf. But we gotta be careful  'cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked.  So that's the same concept. Then again  sometimes economists get it wrong. One thing we observed in the data is that it looked like    the gang leader always got paid. No matter how bad it was economically  he always got himself paid. We had some theories related to cash flow  and lack of access to capital markets  and things like that. Then we asked the gang member   Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid   His response is   You got all these niggers below you who want your job  you dig  If you start taking losses  they see you as weak and shit.  And I thought about it and said   CEOs often pay themselves million dollar bonuses  even when companies are losing a lot of money. And it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important.  Maybe  weak and shit  is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard  and I'll try to make some connections myself  in case you missed them. But I want to start with what I call the  official dogma.  The official dogma of what  The official dogma of all Western industrial societies. And the official dogma runs like this  if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens  the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom. The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good  valuable  worthwhile  essential to being human. And because if people have freedom  then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare  and no one has to decide on our behalf. The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice. The more choice people have  the more freedom they have  and the more freedom they have  the more welfare they have. This  I think  is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it. And it's also deeply embedded in our lives. I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us. This is my supermarket. Not such a big one. I want to say just a word about salad dressing.     salad dressings in my supermarket  if you don't count the    extra virgin olive oils and    balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings  in the off chance that none of the     the store has on offer suit you. So this is what the supermarket is like. And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system    speakers  CD player  tape player  tuner  amplifier    and in this one single consumer electronics store  there are that many stereo systems. We can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store. You've got to admit that's a lot of choice. In other domains    the world of communications. There was a time  when I was a boy  when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted  as long as it came from Ma Bell. You rented your phone. You didn't buy it. One consequence of that  by the way  is that the phone never broke. And those days are gone. We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones  especially in the world of cell phones. These are cell phones of the future. My favorite is the middle one    the MP  player  nose hair trimmer  and cr me br l e torch. And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet  you can rest assured that one day soon  you will. And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question. And do you know what the answer to this question now is  The answer is  no.  It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much. So  in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things  the same explosion of choice is true. Health care. It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor  and the doctor tells you what to do. Instead  you go to the doctor  and the doctor tells you   Well  we could do A  or we could do B. A has these benefits  and these risks. B has these benefits  and these risks. What do you want to do   And you say   Doc  what should I do   And the doc says   A has these benefits and risks  and B has these benefits and risks. What do you want to do   And you say   If you were me  Doc  what would you do   And the doc says   But I'm not you.  And the result is    we call it  patient autonomy   which makes it sound like a good thing  but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something    namely  the doctor    to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions    namely  the patient. There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me  which  if you think about it  makes no sense at all  since we can't buy them. Why do they market to us if we can't buy them  The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed. Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice  as this slide is meant to indicate. We don't inherit an identity  we get to invent it. And we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like. And that means that every day  when you wake up in the morning  you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. With respect to marriage and family  there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could  and then you started having kids as soon as you could. The only real choice was who  not when  and not what you did after. Nowadays  everything is very much up for grabs. I teach wonderfully intelligent students  and I assign    percent less work than I used to. And it's not because they're less smart  and it's not because they're less diligent. It's because they are preoccupied  asking themselves   Should I get married or not  Should I get married now  Should I get married later  Should I have kids first  or a career first   All of these are consuming questions. And they're going to answer these questions  whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses. And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer. Work    we are blessed  as Carl was pointing out  with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet    except the Randolph Hotel. There is one corner  by the way  that I'm not going to tell anybody about  where the WiFi actually works. I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it. So what this means  this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work  is that we have to make a decision  again and again and again  about whether we should or shouldn't be working. We can go to watch our kid play soccer  and we have our cell phone on one hip  and our Blackberry on our other hip  and our laptop  presumably  on our laps. And even if they're all shut off  every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game  we are also asking ourselves   Should I answer this cell phone call  Should I respond to this email  Should I draft this letter   And even if the answer to the question is  no   it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been. So everywhere we look  big things and small things  material things and lifestyle things  life is a matter of choice. And the world we used to live in looked like this.  Well  actually  they are written in stone.  That is to say  there were some choices  but not everything was a matter of choice. And the world we now live in looks like this.  The Ten Commandments DYI Kit  And the question is  is this good news  or bad news  And the answer is   yes.  We all know what's good about it  so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. All of this choice has two effects  two negative effects on people. One effect  paradoxically  is that it produces paralysis  rather than liberation. With so many options to choose from  people find it very difficult to choose at all. I'll give you one very dramatic example of this  a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard  the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about       different workplaces. And what she found is that for every    mutual funds the employer offered  rate of participation went down two percent. You offer    funds       percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why  Because with    funds to choose from  it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose  that you'll just put it off until tomorrow. And then tomorrow  and tomorrow  and tomorrow  and of course tomorrow never comes. Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away  it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer. By not participating  they are passing up as much as       dollars a year from the employer  who would happily match their contribution. So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices. And I think it makes the world look like this.  And lastly  for all eternity  French  bleu cheese  or ranch   You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity  right  You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund  or the wrong salad dressing. So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice  we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. And there are several reasons for this. One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from  if you buy one  and it's not perfect    and what salad dressing is     it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made  and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made  even if it was a good decision. The more options there are  the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose. Second  what economists call  opportunity costs.  Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to. Well  when there are lots of alternatives to consider  it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen. Here's an example.  I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W   th street  Sorry if you're not New Yorkers. Here's what you're supposed to be thinking. Here's this couple on the Hamptons. Very expensive real estate. Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves. What could be better   Well  damn it   this guy is thinking   It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away. I could be parking right in front of my building.  And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity  day after day  to have a great parking space. Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose  even when what we choose is terrific. And the more options there are to consider  the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs. Here's another example. Now this cartoon makes a lot of points. It makes points about living in the moment as well  and probably about doing things slowly. But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing  you're choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive features  and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive. Third  escalation of expectations. This hit me when I went to replace my jeans. I wear jeans almost all the time. There was a time when jeans came in one flavor  and you bought them  and they fit like crap  they were incredibly uncomfortable  if you wore them and washed them enough times  they started to feel OK. I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones  and I said   I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size.  And the shopkeeper said   Do you want slim fit  easy fit  relaxed fit  You want button fly or zipper fly  You want stonewashed or acid washed  Do you want them distressed  You want boot cut  tapered  blah blah.  On and on he went. My jaw dropped. And after I recovered  I said   I want the kind that used to be the only kind.  He had no idea what that was  so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans  and I walked out of the store    truth     with the best fitting jeans I had ever had. I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better. But    I felt worse. Why  I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. The reason    The reason I felt worse is that  with all of these options available  my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up. I had very low  no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor. When they came in     flavors  damn it  one of them should've been perfect. And what I got was good  but it wasn't perfect. And so I compared what I got to what I expected  and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected. Adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be. And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results  even when they're good results. Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.  It all looks so great. I can't wait to be disappointed.  Because if they did  you wouldn't all know what this was about. The truth is more like this.  Everything was better back when everything was worse  The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse  it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. Nowadays  the world we live in    we affluent  industrialized citizens  with perfection the expectation    the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations  my expectations  have gone through the roof. The secret to happiness    this is what you all came for    the secret to happiness is low expectations.  You'll do  I want to say    just a little autobiographical moment    that I actually am married to a wife  and she's really quite wonderful. I couldn't have done better. I didn't settle. But settling isn't always such a bad thing. Finally    One consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied  and you ask why  who's responsible  the answer is clear  the world is responsible. What could you do  When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available  and you buy one that is disappointing  and you ask why  who's responsible  It is equally clear that the answer to the question is  you.  You could have done better. With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display  there is no excuse for failure. And so when people make decisions  and even though the results of the decisions are good  they feel disappointed about them  they blame themselves. Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. I believe a significant    not the only  but a significant    contributor to this explosion of depression  and also suicide  is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high  and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves  they think they're at fault. And so the net result is that we do better in general  objectively  and we feel worse. So let me remind you. This is the official dogma  the one that we all take to be true  and it's all false. It is not true. There's no question that some choice is better than none  but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is. I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare. Now  as a policy matter    I'm almost done    as a policy matter  the thing to think about is this  what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence. There are lots of places in the world  and we have heard about several of them  where their problem is not that they have too much choice. Their problem is that they have too little. So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern  affluent  Western societies. And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this  Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install child seats don't help. It's a waste of money. What I'm telling you is that these expensive  complicated choices    it's not simply that they don't help. They actually hurt. They actually make us worse off. If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options  not only would those people's lives be improved  but ours would be improved also  which is what economists call a  Pareto improving move.  Income redistribution will make everyone better off    not just poor people    because of how all this excess choice plagues us. So to conclude.  You can be anything you want to be    no limits  You're supposed to read this cartoon  and  being a sophisticated person  say   Ah  What does this fish know  You know  nothing is possible in this fishbowl.  Impoverished imagination  a myopic view of the world    and that's the way I read it at first. The more I thought about it  however  the more I came to the view that this fish knows something. Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible  you don't have freedom. You have paralysis. If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible  you decrease satisfaction. You increase paralysis  and you decrease satisfaction. Everybody needs a fishbowl. This one is almost certainly too limited    perhaps even for the fish  certainly for us. But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery  and  I suspect  disaster. Thank you very much. When you have    minutes to speak  two million years seems like a really long time. But evolutionarily  two million years is nothing. And yet in two million years  the human brain has nearly tripled in mass  going from the one and a quarter pound brain of our ancestor here  Habilis  to the almost three pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears. What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one  Well  it turns out when brains triple in size  they don't just get three times bigger  they gain new structures. And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part  called the  frontal lobe.  Particularly  a part called the  pre frontal cortex.  What does a pre frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time  It turns out the pre frontal cortex does lots of things  but one of the most important things it does is an experience simulator. Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes. Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life. This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do  and that no other animal can do quite like we can. It's a marvelous adaptation. It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall. All of you have done this. Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver and onion ice cream  and it's not because they whipped some up  tried it and went   Yuck.  It's because  without leaving your armchair  you can simulate that flavor and say  yuck  before you make it. Let's see how your experience simulators are working. Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk. Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate. You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer. One of them is winning the lottery. This is about     million dollars. And the other is becoming paraplegic. Just give it a moment of thought. You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought. Interestingly  there are data on these two groups of people  data on how happy they are. And this is exactly what you expected  isn't it  But these aren't the data. I made these up  These are the data. You failed the pop quiz  and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture. Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs  and a year after winning the lotto  lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives. Don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz  because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time. The research that my laboratory has been doing  that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing  has revealed something really quite startling to us  something we call the  impact bias   which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly. For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are. From field studies to laboratory studies  we see that winning or losing an election  gaining or losing a romantic partner  getting or not getting a promotion  passing or not passing a college test  on and on  have far less impact  less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have. This almost floors me    a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago  with only a few exceptions  it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness. Why  Because happiness can be synthesized. Sir Thomas Brown wrote in        I am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches  adversity to prosperity. I am more invulnerable than Achilles  fortune hath not one place to hit me.  What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head  Well  it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have. Human beings have something that we might think of as a  psychological immune system.  A system of cognitive processes  largely non conscious cognitive processes  that help them change their views of the world  so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves. Like Sir Thomas  you have this machine. Unlike Sir Thomas  you seem not to know it. We synthesize happiness  but we think happiness is a thing to be found. Now  you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness  I suspect. Though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence  you don't have to look very far for evidence. As a challenge to myself  since I say this once in a while in lectures  I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness. Here are three guys synthesizing happiness.  I am so much better off physically  financially  emotionally  mentally and almost every other way.   I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.   I believe it turned out for the best.  Who are these characters who are so damn happy  The first one is Jim Wright. Some of you are old enough to remember  he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done. He lost everything. The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything. He lost his money  he lost his power. What does he have to say all these years later   I am so much better off physically  financially  mentally and in almost every other way.  What other way would there be to be better off  Vegetably  Minerally  Animally  He's pretty much covered them there. Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of. Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released. He was    years old. He'd spent    years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn't commit.  He was ultimately released for good behavior halfway through his sentence.  What did he say about his experience   I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.  Glorious  He is not saying   Well  there were some nice guys. They had a gym.   Glorious   a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience. Harry S. Langerman uttered these words  and he's somebody you might have known but didn't  because in      he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named McDonalds. And he thought   That's a really neat idea   So he went to find them. They said   We can give you a franchise on this for       bucks.  Harry went back to New York  asked his brother  an investment banker  to loan him the         and his brother's immortal words were   You idiot  nobody eats hamburgers.  He wouldn't lend him the money  and of course  six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea. It turns out people do eat hamburgers  and Ray Kroc  for a while  became the richest man in America. And then finally    you know  the best of all possible worlds    some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best  who was the original drummer for the Beatles  until they  you know  sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour. Well  in       when Pete Best was interviewed    yes  he's still a drummer  yes  he's a studio musician    he had this to say   I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles.  Okay. There's something important to be learned from these people  and it is the secret of happiness. Here it is  finally to be revealed. First  accrue wealth  power  and prestige  then lose it. Second  spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can. Third  make somebody else really  really rich. And finally  never ever join the Beatles. OK. Now I  like Ze Frank  can predict your next thought  which is   Yeah  right.  Because when people synthesize happiness  as these gentlemen seem to have done  we all smile at them  but we kind of roll our eyes and say   Yeah right  you never really wanted the job.   Oh yeah  right. You really didn't have that much in common with her  and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face.  We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call  natural happiness.  What are these terms  Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted  and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted. And in our society  we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind. Why do we have that belief  Well  it's very simple. What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it  With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard  a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable  because they don't want stuff enough. I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for. I'm a scientist  so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric  but by marinating you in a little bit of data. Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks. And this isn't mine. It's a    year old paradigm called the  free choice paradigm.  It's very simple. You bring in  say  six objects  and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked. In this case  because this experiment uses them  these are Monet prints. So  everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they like the most  to the one they like the least. Now we give you a choice   We happen to have some extra prints in the closet. We're going to give you one as your prize to take home. We happen to have number three and number four   we tell the subject. This is a bit of a difficult choice  because neither one is preferred strongly to the other  but naturally  people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four. Sometime later    it could be    minutes  it could be    days    the same stimuli are put before the subject  and the subject is asked to re rank the stimuli.  Tell us how much you like them now.  What happens  Watch as happiness is synthesized. This is the result that has been replicated over and over again. You're watching happiness be synthesized. Would you like to see it again  Happiness   The one I got is really better than I thought  That other one I didn't get sucks   That's the synthesis of happiness. Now  what's the right response to that   Yeah  right   Now  here's the experiment we did  and I hope this is going to convince you that  Yeah  right   was not the right response. We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia. These are hospitalized patients. Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome  a polyneuritic psychosis. They drank way too much  and they can't make new memories. OK  They remember their childhood  but if you walk in and introduce yourself  and then leave the room  when you come back  they don't know who you are. We took our Monet prints to the hospital. And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least. We then gave them the choice between number three and number four. Like everybody else  they said   Gee  thanks Doc  That's great  I could use a new print. I'll take number three.  We explained we would have number three mailed to them. We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room  and counted to a half hour. Back into the room  we say   Hi  we're back.  The patients  bless them  say   Ah  Doc  I'm sorry  I've got a memory problem  that's why I'm here. If I've met you before  I don't remember.   Really  you don't remember  I was just here with the Monet prints    Sorry  Doc  I just don't have a clue.   No problem  Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least.  What do they do  Well  let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac. We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own  which one they chose last time  which one is theirs. And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess. These are normal controls  where if I did this with you  all of you would know which print you chose. But if I do this with amnesiac patients  they don't have a clue. They can't pick their print out of a lineup. Here's what normal controls do  they synthesize happiness. Right  This is the change in liking score  the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked. Normal controls show    that was the magic I showed you  now I'm showing it to you in graphical form     The one I own is better than I thought. The one I didn't own  the one I left behind  is not as good as I thought.  Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result. These people like better the one they own  but they don't know they own it.  Yeah  right  is not the right response  What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really  truly changed their affective  hedonic  aesthetic reactions to that poster. They're not just saying it because they own it  because they don't know they own it. Now  when psychologists show you bars  you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people. And yet  all of us have this psychological immune system  this capacity to synthesize happiness  but some of us do this trick better than others. And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do. It turns out that freedom    the ability to make up your mind and change your mind    is the friend of natural happiness  because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy. But freedom to choose  to change and make up your mind  is the enemy of synthetic happiness. And I'm going to show you why. Dilbert already knows  of course. You're reading as I'm talking.  Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you    My printer prints a blank page after every document.   Why complain about getting free paper    Free  Aren't you just giving me my own paper    Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper  Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same    Now that you mention it  it does seem a little silkier    What are you doing    I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change.  Indeed. The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck  when we are trapped. This is the difference between dating and marriage. You go out on a date with a guy  and he picks his nose  you don't go out on another date. You're married to a guy and he picks his nose  He has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake  You find a way to be happy with what's happened. Now  what I want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves  and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage. Here's an experiment we did at Harvard. We created a black and white photography course  and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom. So we gave them cameras  they went around campus  they took    pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog  and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of. They bring us the camera  we make up a contact sheet  they figure out which are the two best pictures  and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms. And they blow two of them up  and they have two gorgeous eight by    glossies of meaningful things to them  and we say   Which one would you like to give up   They say   I have to give one up    Yes  we need one as evidence of the class project. So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice. You get to keep one  and I get to keep one.  Now  there are two conditions in this experiment. In one case  the students are told   But you know  if you want to change your mind  I'll always have the other one here  and in the next four days  before I actually mail it to headquarters      yeah   headquarters      I'll be glad to swap it out with you. In fact  I'll come to your dorm room  just give me an email. Better yet  I'll check with you. You ever want to change your mind  it's totally returnable.  The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite   Make your choice  and by the way  the mail is going out  gosh  in two minutes  to England. Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic. You will never see it again.  Half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind. Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking  satisfaction with the pictures. And look at what we find. First of all  here's what students think is going to happen. They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind  but these are not statistically significant differences. It's a very small increase  and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition. Wrong o. Bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening. Both right before the swap and five days later  people who are stuck with that picture  who have no choice  who can never change their mind  like it a lot  And people who are deliberating     Should I return it  Have I gotten the right one  Maybe this isn't the good one  Maybe I left the good one      have killed themselves. They don't like their picture  and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired  they still don't like their picture. Why  Because the  reversible  condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness. So here's the final piece of this experiment. We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say   You know  we're doing a photography course  and we can do it one of two ways. We could do it so that when you take the two pictures  you'd have four days to change your mind  or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it. Which course would you like to be in   Duh     percent of the students  two thirds  prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind. Hello     percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture. Because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows. The Bard said everything best  of course  and he's making my point here but he's making it hyperbolically   'Tis nothing good or bad   But thinking makes it so.  It's nice poetry  but that can't exactly be right. Is there really nothing good or bad  Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing  That seems like a one question IQ test. They can't be exactly the same. In more turgid prose  but closer to the truth  was the father of modern capitalism  Adam Smith  and he said this. This is worth contemplating   The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another    Some of these situations may  no doubt  deserve to be preferred to others  but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice  or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds  either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly  or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice.  In other words  yes  some things are better than others. We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures  we are at risk. When our ambition is bounded  it leads us to work joyfully. When our ambition is unbounded  it leads us to lie  to cheat  to steal  to hurt others  to sacrifice things of real value. When our fears are bounded  we're prudent  we're cautious  we're thoughtful. When our fears are unbounded and overblown  we're reckless  and we're cowardly. The lesson I want to leave you with  from these data  is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown  because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience. Thank you.
