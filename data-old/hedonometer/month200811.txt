I think the future of this planet depends on humans  not technology  and we already have the knowledge    we re kind of at the endgame with knowledge. But we re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception. We still have one foot in the dark ages. And when you listen to some of the presentations here    and the extraordinary range of human capability  our understandings    and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet   Earth   it s pretty extraordinary    we have one foot in the dark ages. Just quickly  Aristotle  his thing was   It s not flat  stupid  it s round.  Galileo    he had the Inquisition  so he had to be a little bit more polite    his was   It s not in the middle  you know.  And Hawkes   it s not earth  stupid  it s ocean.  This is an ocean planet. T.S. Eliot really said it for me    and this should give you goose bumps   we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time.  And the next lines are   Through the unknown remembered gate  where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning.  So I have one message. It seems to me that we re all pointed in the wrong direction. For the rocketeers in the audience  I love what you re doing  I admire the guts  I admire the courage    but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction. And it s all a question of perspective. Let me try and tell you    I don t mean to insult you  but look  if I    and I m not doing this for real because it would be an insult  so I m going to pretend  and it softens the blow    I m going to tell you what you re thinking. If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth  and I held up another square that was the root two square    so it s  .  times bigger    and was the color of the oceans  and I said  what is the relative value of these two things  Well  it s the relative importance. You would say    yeah  yeah  yeah  we all know this  water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land. But it s a question of perception  and if that s what you re thinking  if that s what you think I mean when I say   This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'  If you think that that s the relative importance  two to one  you re wrong by a factor of ten. Now  you re not as thick as two short planks  but you sound like it when you say  Earth   because that demonstration  if I turned around this way    that earth plane would be as thin as paper. It s a thin film  two dimensional existence. The ocean representation would have a depth to it. And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is    to  . It turns out that something more than    percent of life on earth is aquatic. That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority. The problem we have in believing that is    you just have to give up this notion that this Earth was created for us. Because it s a problem we have. If this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet  it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks. Okay. Let me criticize this thing. I m not talking about James Cameron    although I could  but I won t. You really do have to go and see his latest film   Aliens of the Deep.  It s incredible. It features two of these deep rovers  and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine. This  I think  represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built. If you look at that sub  you ll see a sphere. This is an acryclic sphere. It generates all of the buoyancy  all of the payload for the craft  and the batteries are down here hanging underneath  exactly like a balloon. This is the envelope  and this is the gondola  the payload. Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights. And this one actually carries two great manipulators. It actually is a very good working sub    that s what it was designed for. The problem with it is    and the reason I will never build another one like it    is that this is a product of two dimensional thinking. It s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers  we take all our terrestrial hang ups  all our constraints    importantly  these two dimensional constraints that we have  and they re so constrained we don t even understand it    and we take them underwater. You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat. A seat works in a two dimensional world  where gravity blasts down on that seat  OK  And in a two dimensional world  we do know about the third dimension but we don t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity. And then our mothers tell us   Careful you don t fall down     because you ll fall over. Now  go into the real atmosphere of this planet. This planet has an inner atmosphere of water  it s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres    a lesser  outer gaseous atmosphere  a lighter one. Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere. And that life enjoys a three dimensional existence  which is alien to us. Fish do not sit in seats. They don t. Their mothers don t say to little baby fish   Careful you don t fall over.  They don t fall over. They don t fall. They live in a three dimensional world where there is no difference in energy between going this way  that way  that way or that way. It s truly a three dimensional space. And we re only just beginning to grasp it. I don t know of any other submersible  or even remote  that just takes advantage that this is a three dimensional space. This is the way we should be going into the oceans. This is a three dimensional machine. What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals  and move in this three dimensional space. OK  this is good stuff. This is man s first attempt at flying underwater. Right now  I m just coming down on this gorgeous  big  giant manta ray. She has twice the wingspan that I do. There I m coming  she sees me. And just notice how she rolls under and turns  she doesn t sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down    she just rolls. And the craft that I m in    this hasn t been shown before. Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn t been shown before. I wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up. There I am  I see her coming back  coming up underneath me. I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down. I m trying to do everything very gently. We spent about three hours together and she s beginning to trust me. And this ballet is controlled by this lady here. She gets about that close and then she pulls away. So now I try and go after her  but I m practicing flying. This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype. This was a fly by wire. It has wings. There re no silly buoyancy tanks    it s permanently  positively buoyant. And then by moving through the water it s able to take that control. Now  look at that  look  it s    she just blew me away. She just rolled right away from underneath. Really that s the only real dive I ve ever made in this machine. It took    years to build. But this lady here taught me  hah  taught me so much. We just learned so much in three hours in the water there. I just had to go and build another machine. But look here. Instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it  it s a little bit of back pressure  and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water. This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you  Sony. I don t really look that ugly  but the camera is so close that it s just distorted. Now  there she goes  right overhead. This is a wide angle camera. She s just a few inches off the top of my head.  Aah  ha  oh  he just crossed over the top of my head about  oh  I don t know  just so close.  I come back up  not for air.  This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I m speechless. We ve been just feet apart. I m going back down now.  Okay  can we cut that  Lights back up please. Trying to fly and keep up with that animal    it wasn t the lack of maneuverability that we had. It was the fact she was going so slow. I actually designed that to move faster through the water because I thought that was the thing that we needed to do  to move fast and get range. But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance. She wanted to dance. And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip  develop higher forces. So the sub that was outside last year    this is the one. You see the larger wing area here. Also  clearly  it was such a powerful thing  we wanted to try and bring other people but we couldn't figure out how to do it. So we opened the world s first flight school. The rational for the world s first flight school goes something like  when the coastguards come up to me and say    they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things  but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous    they would come up and say   Do you have a license for that   And then I d put my sunglasses on  the beard that would all sprout out  and I would say   I don t need no stinking license.   I write these stinking license   which I do. So Bob Gelfond's around here    but somebody in the audience here has license number   . They re one of the first subsea aviators. So we ve run two flight schools. Where the hell that goes  I don t know  but it s a lot of fun. What comes next in    seconds  I can t tell you. But the patent for underwater flight    Karen and I  we were looking at it  some business partners wanted us to patent it    we weren t sure about that. We ve decided we re just going to let that go. It just seems wrong to try and patent       the freedom for underwater flight. So anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us  go for it. The other thing is that we ve got much lower costs. We developed some other technology called spider optics  and Craig Ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning  we re going to be building a beautiful  little  small version of this    unmanned  super deep    for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff. Thank you. This was in an area called Wellawatta  a prime residential area in Colombo. We stood on the railroad tracks that ran between my friend's house and the beach. The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally  but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal. I'd never seen the reef here before. There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water. Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags. They were trying to catch fish. No one realized that this was a very bad idea. The people on the tracks just continued to watch them. I turned around to check on my friend's house. Then someone on the tracks screamed. Before I could turn around  everyone on the tracks was screaming and running. The water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef. The children managed to run back onto the tracks. No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb. In about two minutes  it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it. We had run about     meters by this time. It continued to rise. I saw an old man standing at his gate  knee deep in water  refusing to move. He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach  and that he would rather die there than run. A boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog  who was apparently afraid. An old lady  crying  was carried out of her house and up the road by her son. The slum built on the railroad reservation between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away. Since this was a high risk location  the police had warned the residents  and no one was there when the water rose. But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings. For hours afterwards  the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around    all of this was from the houses in the slum. When the waters subsided  it was as if it had never existed. This may seem hard to believe    unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports    but in many places  after the tsunami  villagers were still terrified. When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people  homes and long tail boats    mercilessly  without warning    and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming  I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either. One of the scariest things about the tsunami that I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information. This may seem minor  but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave  bigger than the last  will be coming at exactly   p.m.  or perhaps tonight  or perhaps ... You don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water  to catch a boat to the hospital. We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed. We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital  but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier  then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead  which is more protected. We don't think another wave is coming right away. At the Phi Phi Hill Resort  I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television  but I strained to listen for information. They reported that there was an  .  magnitude earthquake in Sumatra  which triggered the massive tsunami. Having this news was comforting in some small way to understand what had just happened to us. However  the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now. In general  everything was merely hearsay and rumor  and not a single person I spoke to for over    hours knew anything with any certainty. Those were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs that essentially sprang up after it occurred. I'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami that also were shown on blogs. I should warn you  they're pretty powerful. One from Thailand  and the second one from Phuket as well. Voice    It's coming in. It's coming again. Voice    It's coming again  Voice    Yeah. It's coming again. Voice    Come get inside here. Voice    It's coming again. Voice    New wave  Voice    It's coming again. New wave   Unclear  They called me out here. James Surowiecki  Phew. Those were both on this site  waveofdestruction.org. In the world of blogs  there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami  because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that  although initially    that is  in that first day    there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting  there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this. They said   The blogsters let us down.  What became very clear was that  within a few days  the outpouring of information was immense  and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before. And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized  unconnected writers  video bloggers  etc.  who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us. And so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment  a moment in which the blogosphere came  to a certain degree  of age. Now  I'm going to move now from this kind of    the sublime in the traditional sense of the word  that is to say  awe inspiring  terrifying    to the somewhat more mundane. Because when we think about blogs  I think for most of us who are concerned about them  we're primarily concerned with things like politics  technology  etc. And I want to ask three questions in this talk  in the    minutes that remain  about the blogosphere. The first one is  What does it tell us about our ideas  about what motivates people to do things  The second is  Do blogs genuinely have the possibility of accessing a kind of collective intelligence that has previously remained  for the most part  untapped  And then the third part is  What are the potential problems  or the dark side of blogs as we know them  OK  the first question  What do they tell us about why people do things  One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically  and  of course  the Internet more generally    and it's going to seem like a very obvious point  but I think it is an important one to think about    is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content every day  who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing  linking  commenting on the substance of the Internet  are doing so primarily for free. They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and  to some extent  the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job. And this is    at least  to a traditional economist    somewhat remarkable  because the traditional account of economic man would say that  basically  you do things for a concrete reward  primarily financial. But instead  what we're finding on the Internet    and one of the great geniuses of it    is that people have found a way to work together without any money involved at all. They have come up with  in a sense  a different method for organizing activity. The Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler  in an essay called  Coase's Penguin   talks about this open source model  which we're familiar with from Linux  as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations. And  you know  if you think about this with the tsunami  what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists  who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories. That's a very powerful idea  and it's a very powerful reality. And it's one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road. So  I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational  and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money  or  you have to pay for it to be good  but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands. There are a few bloggers    somewhere maybe around     now    who do  in fact  make some kind of money  and a few who are actually trying to make a full time living out of it  but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it or they love the attention  or whatever it is. So  Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this and  I think  is writing about this more  but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one  and one worth thinking about. The second question is  What does the blogosphere actually do for us  in terms of accessing collective intelligence  You know  as Chris mentioned  I wrote a book called  The Wisdom of Crowds.  And the premise of  The Wisdom of Crowds  is that  under the right conditions  groups can be remarkably intelligent. And they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them. The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar. If I had a jar of jellybeans and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar  your average guess would be remarkably good. It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of beans in the jar  and it would be better than    to    percent of you. There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers  but for the most part the group's guess would be better than just about all of you. And what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work in many more complicated situations. For instance  if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack  they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win. In a sense  the group of betters at the racetrack is forecasting the future  in probabilistic terms. You know  if you think about something like Google  which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information    we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that  and it does that because  collectively  this disorganized thing we call the  World Wide Web  actually has a remarkable order  or a remarkable intelligence in it. And this  I think  is one of the real promises of the blogosphere. Dan Gillmor    whose book  We the Media  is included in the gift pack    has talked about it as saying that  as a writer  he's recognized that his readers know more than he does. And this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea to mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise  and who has a lot of energy invested in the notion that he or she knows better than everyone else. But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective  distributive intelligence that is out there  and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it. Each blog post  each blog commentary may not  in and of itself  be exactly what we're looking for  but collectively the judgment of those people posting  those people linking  more often than not is going to give you a very interesting and enormously valuable picture of what's going on. So  that's the positive side of it. That's the positive side of what is sometimes called participatory journalism or citizen journalism  etc.    that  in fact  we are giving people who have never been able to talk before a voice  and we're able to access information that has always been there but has essentially gone untapped. But there is a dark side to this  and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on. One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet  and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet  is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet. It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized  bottom up structure of the Internet. It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things    that being linked from one place to another  that being tightly linked in a group  is a very good thing. And much of the time it is. But there's also a downside to this    a kind of dark side  in fact    and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other  the harder it is for each of us to remain independent. One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that  once you are linked in the network  the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else. That's one of the things that defines what a network is. A network is not just the product of its component parts. It is something more than that. It is  as Steven Johnson has talked about  an emergent phenomenon. Now  this has all these benefits  it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information  it gives you access to a whole host of people  it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways. But the problem is that groups are only smart when the people in them are as independent as possible. This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds  or the paradox of collective intelligence  that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking. And networks make it harder for people to do that  because they drive attention to the things that the network values. So  one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme  once an idea gets going  it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on  because other people have  say  a link. People have linked to it  and so other people in turn link to it  etc.  etc. And that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere  particularly of the political blogosphere  and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful  decentralized  bottom up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions. The metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill. A lot of people talk about ants. You know  this is a conference inspired by nature. When we talk about bottom up  decentralized phenomena  the ant colony is the classic metaphor  because  no individual ant knows what it's doing  but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions. They're able to reach food as efficiently as possible  they're able to guide their traffic with remarkable speed. So  the ant colony is a great model  you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing. But we know that occasionally ants go astray  and what happens is that  if army ants are wandering around and they get lost  they start to follow a simple rule    just do what the ant in front of you does. And what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle. And there's this famous example of one that was       feet long and lasted for two days  and the ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died. And that  I think  is a sort of thing to watch out for. That's the thing we have to fear    is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die. Now  I want to connect this back  though  to the tsunami  because one of the great things about the tsunami    in terms of the blogosphere's coverage  not in terms of the tsunami itself    is that it really did represent a genuine bottom up phenomenon. You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic. You saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view in a way that they hadn't before. There  you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself. So  that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside. And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for. Thank you very much.  Applause  Thank you for being here. And I say  thank you for being here  because I was silent for    years. And the first words that I spoke were in Washington  D.C.  on the   th anniversary of Earth Day. And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak. And I said   Thank you for being here.  My mother  out in the audience  she jumped up   Hallelujah  Johnny s talking   Imagine if you were quiet for    years and your mother was out in the audience  say. My dad said to me   That s one     I ll explain that. But I turned around because I didn t recognize where my voice was coming from. I hadn t heard my voice in    years  so I turned around and I looked and I said   God  who's saying what I m thinking   And then I realized it was me  you know  and I kind of laughed. And I could see my father   Yeah  he really is crazy.  Well  I want to take you on this journey. And the journey  I believe  is a metaphor for all of our journeys. Even though this one is kind of unusual  I want you to think about your own journey. My journey began in      when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate  and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay. It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles. That s a big thing in California. And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness  California  because there were only about     people there in the winter   this was back in '   now. And so when I came in and I started walking around  people    they just knew what was going on. And people would drive up next to me and say   John  what are you doing   And I d say   Well  I m walking for the environment.  And they said   No  you re walking to make us look bad  right  You re walking to make us feel bad.  And maybe there was some truth to that  because I thought that if I started walking  everyone would follow. Because of the oil  everybody talked about the polllution. And so I argued with people about that  I argued and I argued. I called my parents up. I said   I ve given up riding and driving in cars.  My dad said   Why didn t you do that when you were      I didn t know about the environment then. They re back in Philadelphia. And so I told my mother   I m happy though  I m really happy.  She said   If you were happy  son  you wouldn t have to say it.  Mothers are like that. And so  on my   th birthday I decided  because I argued so much and I talk so much  that I was going to stop speaking for just one day    one day    to give it a rest. And so I did. I got up in the morning and I didn t say a word. And I have to tell you  it was a very moving experience  because for the first time  I began listening    in a long time. And what I heard  it kind of disturbed me. Because what I used to do  when I thought I was listening  was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could    I knew what they were going to say  and so I stopped listening. And in my mind  I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back  while they were still finishing up. And then I would launch in. Well  that just ended communication. So on this first day I actually listened. And it was very sad for me  because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning. I was   . I thought I knew everything. I didn t. And so I decided I d better do this for another day  and another day  and another day until finally  I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more. So for a year I said I would keep quiet  and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again. Well  that lasted    years. Now during that time    those    years    I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal  and I tried to study the environment by reading books. And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did. I walked up to Ashland  Oregon  where they were offering an environmental studies degree. It s only     miles. And I went into the Registrar s office and     What  what  what   I had a newspaper clipping.  Oh  so you really want to go to school here  You don t    We have a special program for you.  They did. And in those two years  I graduated with my first degree    a bachelor s degree. And my father came out  he was so proud. He said   Listen  we re really proud of you son  but what are you going to do with a bachelor s degree  You don t ride in cars  you don t talk    you re going to have to do those things.  I hunched my shoulder  I picked my backpack up again and I started walking. I walked all the way up to Port Townsend  Washington  where I built a wooden boat  rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington  to  Idaho and down to Missoula  Montana. I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I'd like to go to school there. I said I'd be there in about two years. And I was there. I showed up in two years and they    I tell this story because they really helped me. There are two stories in Montana. The first story is I didn t have any money    that s a sign I used a lot. And they said  Don't worry about that.  The director of the program said   Come back tomorrow.  He gave me     dollars  and he said   Register for one credit. You re going to go to South America  aren t you   And I said    Rivers and lakes  the hydrological systems  South America. So I did that. He came back  he said to me   OK John  now that you've registered for that one credit  you can have a key to an office  you can matriculate    you re matriculating  so you can use the library. And what we re going to do is  we re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class. They re going to save your grade  and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money  then you can register for that class and they ll give you the grade.  Wow  they don t do that in graduate schools  I don t think. But I use that story because they really wanted to help me. They saw that I was really interested in the environment  and they really wanted to help me along the way. And during that time  I actually taught classes without speaking. I had    students when I first walked into the class. I explained  with a friend who could interpret my sign language  that I was John Francis  I was walking around the world  I didn t talk and this was the last time this person s going to be here interpreting for me. All the students sat around and they went ... I could see they were looking for the schedule  to see when they could get out. They had to take that class with me. Two weeks later  everyone was trying to get into our class. And I learned in that class    because I would do things like this ... and they were all gathered around  going   What's he trying to say    I don't know  I think he's talking about clear cutting.   Yeah  clear cutting.   No  no  no  that's not clear cutting  that s    he's using a handsaw.   Well  you can t clearcut with a ...   Yes  you can clear cut ...   No  I think he s talking about selective forestry.  Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion. I just backed out of that  you know  and I just kind of kept the fists from flying. But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean  but I should have. And so what came to me is  if you were a teacher and you were teaching  if you weren t learning you probably weren t teaching very well. And so I went on. My dad came out to see me graduate and  you know  I did the deal  and my father said   We re really proud of you son  but ...   You know what went on  he said   You ve got to start riding and driving and start talking. What are you going to do with a master s degree   I hunched my shoulder  I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin. I spent two years there writing on oil spills. No one was interested in oil spills. But something happened    Exxon Valdez. And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills. My dad came out again. He said   I don't know how you do this  son    I mean  you don't ride in cars  you don t talk. My sister said maybe I should leave you alone  because you seem to be doing a lot better when you re not saying anything.  Well  I put on my backpack again. I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast  put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean    it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States. And on Earth Day          the   th anniversary of Earth Day    that s when I began to speak. And that s why I said   Thank you for being here.  Because it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling  and if there's no one there to hear  does it really make a sound  And I m thanking you  and I'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak. And that s communication. And they also taught me about listening    that they listened to me. And it s one of those things that came out of the silence  the listening to each other. Really  very important    we need to listen to each other. Well  my journey kept going on. My dad said   That s one   and I still didn t let that go. I worked for the Coastguard  was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador. I wrote regulations for the United States    I mean  I wrote oil spill regulations.    years ago  if someone had said to me   John  do you really want to make a difference    Yeah  I want to make a difference.  He said   You just start walking east  get out of your car and just start walking east.  And as I walked off a little bit  they'd say   Yeah  and shut up  too.   You re going to make a difference  buddy.  How could that be  how could that be  How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference  Well  my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time. And after that    I only worked one year    I said   That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that.  I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean  and walked through all of the islands  and to Venezuela. And you know  I forgot the most important thing  which is why I started talking  which I have to tell you. I started talking because I had studied environment. I d studied environment at this formal level  but there was this informal level. And the informal level    I learned about people  and what we do and how we are. And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other. Because if we are the environment  then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other. And so that s the message that I had. And I said   Well  I'm going to have to spread that message.  And I got in my sailboat  sailed all the way through the Caribbean    it wasn't really my sailboat  I kind of worked on that boat    got to Venezuela and I started walking. This is the last part of this story  because it s how I got here  because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles. I was walking through El Dorado    it's a prison town  famous prison  or infamous prison    in Venezuela  and I don t know what possessed me  because this was not like me. There I am  walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says   Pasaporte  pasaporte   and with an M   pointed at me. And I looked at him and I said   Passport  huh  I don't need to show you my passport. It s in the back of my pack. I'm Dr. Francis  I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world.  And I started walking off. What possessed me to say this thing  The road turned into the jungle. I didn t get shot. And I got to    I start saying   Free at last    thank God Almighty  I m free at last.   What was that about   I m saying. What was that about  It took me     miles to figure out that  in my heart  in me  I had become a prisoner. I was a prisoner and I needed to escape. The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles. Now how could that be  Because when I started  it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles. But the thing that was different was that every birthday  I asked myself about silence  but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet. I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador. I had no idea I would have a Ph.D. And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me  and that I was going to have to change. You know  we can do it. I was going to have to change. And I was afraid to change  because I was so used to the guy who only just walked. I was so used to that person that I didn t want to stop. I didn t know who I would be if I changed. But I know I needed to. I know I needed to change  because it would be the only way that I could be here today. And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ve gotten to  but there s another place for us to go. And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ve become  and go to the place of who we are becoming. And so  I want to encourage you to go to that next place  to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in  as comfortable as it may be  because we have to do something now. We have to change now. As our former Vice President said  we have to become activists. So if my voice can touch you  if my actions can touch you  if my being here can touch you  please let it be. And I know that all of you have touched me while I ve been here. So  let s go out into the world and take this caring  this love  this respect that we ve shown each other right here at TED  and take this out into the world. Because we are the environment  and how we treat each other is really how we re going to treat the environment. So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence. Thank you. This is a guy named Bob McKim. He was a creativity researcher in the '  s and '  s  and also led the Stanford Design Program. And in fact  my friend and IDEO founder  David Kelley  who s out there somewhere  studied under him at Stanford. And he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them  their neighbor  very quickly  just as quickly as they could. And in fact  we re going to do that exercise right now. You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper. It s actually got a bunch of circles on it. I need you to turn that piece of paper over  you should find that it s blank on the other side. And there should be a pencil. And I want you to pick somebody that s seated next to you  and when I say  go  you ve got    seconds to draw your neighbor  OK  So  everybody ready  OK. Off you go. You ve got    seconds  you d better be fast. Come on  those masterpieces ... OK  Stop. All right  now. Yes  lot s of laughter. Yeah  exactly. Lots of laughter  quite a bit of embarrassment. Am I hearing a few  sorry s   I think I m hearing a few sorry s. Yup  yup  I think I probably am. And that s exactly what happens every time  every time you do this with adults. McKim found this every time he did it with his students. He got exactly the same response  lots and lots of sorry s. And he would point this out as evidence that we fear the judgment of our peers  and that we re embarrassed about showing our ideas to people we think of as our peers  to those around us. And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking. So we might have a wild idea  but we re afraid to share it with anybody else. OK  so if you try the same exercise with kids  they have no embarrassment at all. They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it. But as they learn to become adults  they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others  and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed. And in studies of kids playing  it s been shown time after time that kids who feel secure  who are in a kind of trusted environment    they re the ones that feel most free to play. And if you re starting a design firm  let s say  then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of security. Where they have the same kind of security to take risks. Maybe have the same kind of security to play. Before founding IDEO  David said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends. Now  that wasn t just self indulgence. He knew that friendship is a short cut to play. And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust  and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers. And so  that decision to work with his friends    now he has     of them    was what got IDEO started. And our studios  like  I think  many creative workplaces today  are designed to help people feel relaxed  familiar with their surroundings  comfortable with the people that they re working with. It takes more than decor  but I think we ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful  and that it s a permissive environment. So  whether it s this microbus meeting room that we have in one our buildings at IDEO  or at Pixar  where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves  or at the Googleplex  where it s famous for its  beach  volleyball courts  and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it. Don t know the reason for the pink flamingos  but anyway  they re there in the garden. Or even in the Swiss office of Google  which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all. And my theory is  that s so the Swiss can prove to their Californian colleagues that they re not boring. So they have the slide  and they even have a fireman s pole. Don t know what they do with that  but they have one. So all of these places have these symbols. Now  our big symbol at IDEO is actually not so much the place  it s a thing. And it s actually something that we invented a few years ago  or created a few years ago. It s a toy  it s called a  finger blaster.  And I forgot to bring one up with me. So if somebody can reach under the chair that s next to them  you ll find something taped underneath it. That s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks  David  I appreciate it. So this is a finger blaster  and you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair. And I m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment. But before we start  I need just to put these on. Thank you. All right. Now  what I m going to do is  I m going to see how    I can t see out of these  OK. I m going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage. So the way they work is  you know  you just put your finger in the thing  pull them back  and off you go. So  don t look backwards. That s my only recommendation here. I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage. So come on  There we go  there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh. I have another idea. I wanted to    there we go. There we go. Thank you  thank you  thank you. Not bad  not bad. No serious injuries so far. Well  they re still coming in from the back there  they re still coming in. Some of you haven t fired them yet. Can you not figure out how to do it  or something  It s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first    seconds  when they pick it up. All right. This is pretty good  this is pretty good. Okay  all right. Let s    I suppose we'd better... I'd better clear these up out of the way  otherwise  I m going to trip over them. All right. So the rest of you can save them for when I say something particularly boring  and then you can fire at me. All right. I think I m going to take these off now  because I can t see a damn thing when I ve    all right  OK. So  ah  that was fun. All right  good. So  OK  so why  So we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs  you know. Why do we have them  Well  as I said  we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important. But why is it important  We use it in a pretty pragmatic way  to be honest. We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions. Helps us do our jobs better  and helps us feel better when we do them. Now  an adult encountering a new situation    when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can  you know. And there s a reason for that  we want to settle on an answer. Life s complicated  we want to figure out what s going on around us very quickly. I suspect  actually  that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons  for  why we want to categorize new things very  very quickly. One of them might be  you know  when we see this funny stripy thing  is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us  Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree  We need to figure that out pretty fast. Well  at least  we did once. Most of us don t need to anymore  I suppose. This is some aluminum foil  right  You use it in the kitchen. That s what it is  isn t it  Of course it is  of course it is. Well  not necessarily. Kids are more engaged with open possibilities. Now  they ll certainly    when they come across something new  they ll certainly ask   What is it   Of course they will. But they ll also ask   What can I do with it   And you know  the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example. And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play. Any parents of young kids in the audience  There must be some. Yeah  thought so. So we ve all seen it  haven t we  We ve all told stories about how  on Christmas morning  our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them. And you know  from an exploration perspective  this behavior makes complete sense. Because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy. Even one like  say  Tickle Me Elmo    which  despite its ingenuity  really only does one thing  whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices. So again  this is another one of those playful activities that  as we get older  we tend to forget and we have to relearn. So another one of Bob McKim s favorite exercises is called the     Circles Test.  So we re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again. Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over  and you ll find those    circles printed on the piece of paper. So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this. So what I m going to do is  I m going to give you minute  and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form. So for example  you could turn one into a football  or another one into a sun. All I m interested in is quantity. I want you to do as many of them as you can  in the minute that I m just about to give you. So  everybody ready  OK  Off you go. Okay. Put down your pencils  as they say. So  who got more than five circles figured out  Hopefully everybody  More than     Keep your hands up if you did   .         Anybody get all     No  Oh  Somebody did. Fantastic. Did anybody to a variation on a theme  Like a smiley face  Happy face  Sad face  Sleepy face  Anybody do that  Anybody use my examples  The sun and the football  Great. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity. I wasn t actually very interested in whether they were all different. I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible. And one of the things we tend to do as adults  again  is we edit things. We stop ourselves from doing things. We self edit as we re having ideas. And in some cases  our desire to be original is actually a form of editing. And that actually isn t necessarily really playful. So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things  even if they don t seem that different from each other  is actually something that kids do well  and it is a form of play. So now  Bob McKim did another version of this test in a rather famous experiment that was done in the     s. Anybody know what this is  It s the peyote cactus. It s the plant from which you can create mescaline  one of the psychedelic drugs. For those of you around in the '  s  you probably know it well. McKim published a paper in       describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity. So he picked    professionals    they were engineers  physicists  mathematicians  architects  furniture designers even  artists    and he asked them to come along one evening  and to bring a problem with them that they were working on. He gave each of them some mescaline  and had them listen to some nice  relaxing music for a while. And then he did what s called the Purdue Creativity Test. You might know it as   How many uses can you find for a paper clip   It s basically the same thing as the    circles thing that I just had you do. Now  actually  he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs  to see what the difference was in people s facility and speed with coming up with ideas. And then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that they d brought. And they d come up with a bunch of interesting solutions    and actually  quite valid solutions    to the things that they d been working on. And so  some of the things that they figured out  some of these individuals figured out  in one case  a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients  a design of a solar space probe experiment  a redesign of the linear electron accelerator  an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder    you can tell this is a while ago  the completion of a line of furniture  and even a new conceptual model of the photon. So it was a pretty successful evening. In fact  maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley got off to its great start with innovation. We don t know  but it may be. We need to ask some of the CEOs whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment. But really  it wasn t the drugs that were important  it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking  and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas. But it s hard to break our habits  our adult habits. At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls. Edicts like   Defer judgment   or  Go for quantity.  And somehow that seems wrong. I mean  can you have rules about creativity  Well  it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process. And we ve certainly learnt that over time  you get much better brainstorming  much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules. Now  of course  many designers  many individual designers  achieve this is in a much more organic way. I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation. And they experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind. They were exploring following what was interesting to them. They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War  I think  and from this experiment they moved on to chairs. Through constant experimentation with materials  they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today  eventually resulting in  of course  the legendary lounge chair. Now  if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution  then we wouldn t be the beneficiaries of so many wonderful designs today. And of course  they used experimentation in all aspects of their work  from films to buildings  from games to graphics. So  they re great examples  I think  of exploration and experimentation in design. Now  while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities  they were also exploring physical objects. And they were doing that through building prototypes. And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I d talk about. So the average Western first grader spends as much as    percent of their play time taking part in what s called  construction play.  Construction play    it s playful  obviously  but also a powerful way to learn. When play is about building a tower out of blocks  the kid begins to learn a lot about towers. And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again  learning is happening as a sort of by product of play. It s classically learning by doing. Now  David Kelley calls this behavior  when it s carried out by designers   thinking with your hands.  And it typically involves making multiple  low resolution prototypes very quickly  often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution. On one of his earliest projects  the team was kind of stuck  and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together a prototype made from a roll on deodorant. Now  that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh. So  they learned their way to that by building prototypes. Another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons. They were meeting with them  they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device. And one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister    which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium    and a clothespin. He taped them all together  ran back into the room and said   You mean  something like this   And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said  well  I want to hold it like this  or like that. And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object. And in the end it turned into a real device. And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world  and having your thinking advanced as a result. At IDEO there s a kind of a back to preschool feel sometimes about the environment. The prototyping carts  filled with colored paper and Play Doh and glue sticks and stuff    I mean  they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them. But the important idea is that everything s at hand  everything s around. So when designers are working on ideas  they can start building stuff whenever they want. They don t necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop to do it. And we think that s pretty important. And then the sad thing is  although preschools are full of this kind of stuff  as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away. They lose this stuff that facilitates this sort of playful and building mode of thinking. And of course  by the time you get to the average workplace  maybe the best construction tool we have might be the Post it notes. It s pretty barren. But by giving project teams and the clients who they re working with permission to think with their hands  quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily. This is a nurse using a very simple    as you can see    plasticine prototype  explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital. And just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way. And of course  by building quick prototypes  we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if we re trying to describe them through words. But what about designing something that isn t physical  Something like a service or an experience  Something that exists as a series of interactions over time  Instead of building play  this can be approached with role play. So  if you re designing an interaction between two people    such as  I don t know    ordering food at a fast food joint or something  you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time. And I think the best way to achieve that  and get a feeling for any flaws in your design  is to act it out. So we do quite a lot of work at IDEO trying to convince our clients of this. They can be a little skeptical  I ll come back to that. But a place  I think  where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems    things like education or security or finance or health. And this is another example in a healthcare environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care. But you know  many adults are pretty reluctant to engage with role play. Some of it s embarrassment and some of it is because they just don t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid. They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying  you know   That s just happening because they re acting it out.  Research into kids' behavior actually suggests that it s worth taking role playing seriously. Because when children play a role  they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they ve learnt from us as adults. If one kid plays  store   and another one s playing  house   then the whole kind of play falls down. So they get used to quite quickly to understanding the rules for social interactions  and are actually quite quick to point out when they re broken. So when  as adults  we role play  then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized. We ve gone through lots of experiences in life  and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work. So we re very good  when acting out a solution  at spotting whether something lacks authenticity. So role play is actually  I think  quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences. Another way for us  as designers  to explore role play is to put ourselves through an experience which we re designing for  and project ourselves into an experience. So here are some designers who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane. And so they grabbed some very simple materials  you can see  and did this role play  this kind of very crude role play  just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes. This is one of our designers  Kristian Simsarian  and he s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient. Now  this is a real hospital  in a real emergency room. One of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didn t want the doctors and nurses thinking he was actually sick  and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later. So anyhow  he went there with his video camera  and it s kind of interesting to see what he brought back. Because when we looked at the video when he got back  we saw    minutes of this. And also  the amazing thing about this video    as soon as you see it you immediately project yourself into that experience. And you know what it feels like  all of that uncertainty while you re left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case in one of the emergency rooms  wondering what the heck s going on. And so this notion of using role play    or in this case  living through the experience as a way of creating empathy    particularly when you use video  is really powerful. Or another one of our designers  Altay Sendil  he s here having his chest waxed  not because he s very vain  although actually he is    no  I m kidding    but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients go through when they re having dressings removed. And so sometimes these analogous experiences  analogous role play  can also be quite valuable. So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter  you know  he s beginning to try on that identity. He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter. We re doing the same thing as designers. We re trying on these experiences. And so the idea of role play is both as an empathy tool  as well as a tool for prototyping experiences. And you know  we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway. Not just because they lead to insights about the experience  but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience. In short  we admire their willingness to play. Playful exploration  playful building and role play  those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work. And so far  I admit  this might feel like it s a message just to go out and play like a kid. And to certain extent it is  but I want to stress a couple of points. The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy. Play has rules  especially when it s group play. When kids play tea party  or they play cops and robbers  they re following a script that they ve agreed to. And it s this code negotiation that leads to productive play. So  remember the sketching task we did at the beginning  The kind of little face  the portrait you did  Well  imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub. But everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks. That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing  difficult situation into a fun game. As a result  we d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time    but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together. But there aren t just rules about how to play  there are rules about when to play. Kids don t play all the time  obviously. They transition in and out of it  and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences. As designers  we need to be able to transition in and out of play also. And if we re running design studios we need to be able to figure out  how can we transition designers through these different experiences  I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of    I think what s very different about design is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation. We go through a sort of generative mode  where we re exploring many ideas  and then we come back together again  and come back looking for that solution  and developing that solution. I think they re two quite different modes  divergence and convergence. And I think it s probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness. Perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious. And so being able to move between those modes is really quite important. So  it s where there s a more nuanced version view of play  I think  is required. Because it s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute. You re either playful or you re serious  and you can t be both. But that s not really true  you can be a serious professional adult and  at times  be playful. It s not an either or  it s an  and.  You can be serious and play. So to sum it up  we need trust to play  and we need trust to be creative. So  there s a connection. And there are a series of behaviors that we ve learnt as kids  and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers. They include exploration  which is about going for quantity  building  and thinking with your hands  and role play  where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we re designing  and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic. Thank you very much.  Applause  The fragrance that you will smell  you will never be able to smell this way again. It s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise  which you can find in any store in the nation. Except here it s been split up in parts by Est e Lauder and by the perfumer who did it  Calice Becker  and I'm most grateful to them for this. And it s been split up in successive bits and a chord. So what you re smelling now is the top note. And then will come what they call the heart  the lush heart note. I will show it to you. The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K. The lush heart note  Melaleuca bark note    which does not contain any Melaleuca bark  because it s totally forbidden. And after that  the complete fragrance. Now what you are smelling is a combination of    I asked how many molecules there were in there  and nobody would tell me. So I put it through a G.C.  a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office  and it s about    . So what you re smelling is several hundred molecules floating through the air  hitting your nose. And do not get the impression that this is very subjective. You are all smelling pretty much the same thing  OK  Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person. It s not really true. And perfumery shows you that can t be true  because if it were like that it wouldn t be an art  OK  Now  while the smell wafts over you  let me tell you the history of an idea. Everything that you re smelling in here is made up of atoms that come from what I call the Upper East Side of the periodic table    a nice  safe neighborhood. You really don t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery. Some people have tried in the     s to add things from the bad parts  and it didn t really work. These are the five atoms from which just about everything that you re going to smell in real life  from coffee to fragrance  are made of. The top note that you smelled at the very beginning  the cut grass green  what we call in perfumery    they re weird terms    and this would be called a green note  because it smells of something green  like cut grass. This is cis   hexene   ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education. This has six carbon atoms  so  hexa   hexene   ol. It has one double bond  it has an alcohol on the end  so it s  ol   and that s why they call it cis   hexene   ol. Once you figure this out  you can really impress people at parties. This smells of cut grass. Now  this is the skeleton of the molecule. If you dress it up with atoms  hydrogen atoms    that s what it looks like when you have it on your computer    but actually it s sort of more like this  in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel. OK  now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass  OK  Why doesn t it smell of potatoes or violets  Well  there are really two theories. But the first theory is  it must be the shape. And that s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape. Enzymes that chew things up  antibodies  it s all  you know  the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing  in this case a smell. And I will try and explain to you what s wrong with this notion. And the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations. Now  this is a totally insane idea. And when I first came across it in the early '  s  I thought my predecessor  Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright  had really taken leave of their senses  and I ll explain to you why this was the case. However  I came to realize gradually that they may be right    and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so  but I m working on it. Here s how shape works in normal receptors. You have a molecule coming in  it gets into the protein  which is schematic here  and it causes this thing to switch  to turn  to move in some way by binding in certain parts. And the attraction  the forces  between the molecule and the protein cause the motion. This is a shape based idea. Now  what s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide. The way   I expect everybody to memorize these compounds. This is one page of work from a chemist s workbook  OK  Working for a fragrance company. He s making    molecules  and he s looking for a sandalwood  something that smells of sandalwood. Because there s a lot of money in sandalwoods. And of these    molecules  only      actually smells of sandalwood. And he puts an exclamation mark  OK  This is an awful lot of work. This actually is roughly  in man years of work          dollars roughly  if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits. So this is a profoundly inefficient process. And my definition of a theory is  it s not just something that you teach people  it s labor saving. A theory is something that enables you to do less work. I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why    a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well. This is cis   hexene   ol. It smells of cut grass. This is cis   hexene   thiol  and this smells of rotten eggs  OK  Now  you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs. If it does  you put the glass down  you go to a different bar. This is    in other words  we never get the O H    we never mistake it for an S H  OK  Like  at no concentration  even pure  you know  if you smelt pure ethanol  it doesn t smell of rotten eggs. Conversely  there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka. It s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition. Now  I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology  and he says   That s easy  The things are a different color   We have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it. These molecules  as you saw in the beginning  the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other. In fact  molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them. So this is the sound of the O H stretch  translated into the audible range. S H  quite a different frequency. Now  this is kind of interesting  because it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact  which is this  nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S H  OK  Now  Fact B  nothing in the world has that frequency except S H. If you look on this  imagine a piano keyboard. The S H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard that has been  so to speak  damaged  and there are no neighboring notes  nothing is close to it. You have a unique smell  a unique vibration. So I went searching when I started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story. I went searching for a type of molecule  any molecule  that would have that vibration and that    the obvious prediction was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur. If it didn t  the whole idea was toast  and I might as well move on to other things. Now  after searching high and low for several months  I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane which has exactly the same vibration. Now the good news is  Boranes you can get hold of. The bad news is they re rocket fuels. Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air  and when you call up the companies  they only give you minimum ten tons  OK  So this was not what they call a laboratory scale experiment  and they wouldn t have liked it at my college. However  I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually  and here is the beast. And it really does have the same    if you calculate  if you measure the vibrational frequencies  they are the same as S H. Now  does it smell of sulfur  Well  if you go back in the literature  there s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone alive then or since  Alfred Stock  he synthesized all of them. And in an enormous    page paper in German he says  at one point    my wife is German and she translated it for me    and at one point he says   ganz widerlich Geruch   an  absolutely repulsive smell   which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide. So this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur had been known since       and utterly forgotten until           . Now  the slight fly in the ointment is this  that if we smell molecular vibrations  we must have a spectroscope in our nose. Now  this is a spectroscope  OK  on my laboratory bench. And it s fair to say that if you look up somebody s nose  you re unlikely to see anything resembling this. And this is the main objection to the theory. OK  great  we smell vibrations. How  All right  Now when people ask this kind of question  they neglect something  which is that physicists are really clever  unlike biologists. This is a joke. I m a biologist  OK  So it s a joke against myself. Bob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company  in the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research  discovered a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano scale. In other words  no mirrors  no lasers  no prisms  no nonsense  just a tiny device  and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling. Now  I could do the dance of electron tunneling  but I ve done a video instead  which is much more interesting. Here s how it works. Electrons are fuzzy creatures  and they can jump across gaps  but only at equal energy. If the energy differs  they can t jump. Unlike us  they won t fall off the cliff. OK. Now. If something absorbs the energy  the electron can travel. So here you have a system  you have something    and there s plenty of that stuff in biology    some substance giving an electron  and the electron tries to jump  and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen  OK  This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built. And every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology. In other words  I ve taken off the shelf components  and I ve made a spectroscope. What s nice about this idea  if you have a philosophical bent of mind  is that then it tells you that the nose  the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses. Of course  it doesn t matter  because it could also be that they re not. But it has a certain       it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people who read too much   th century German literature. And then a magnificent thing happened  I left academia and joined the real world of business  and a company was created around my ideas to make new molecules using my method  along the lines of  let s put someone else s money where your mouth is. And one of the first things that happened was we started going around to fragrance companies asking for what they needed  because  of course  if you could calculate smell  you don t need chemists. You need a computer  a Mac will do it  if you know how to program the thing right  OK  So you can try a thousand molecules  you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend  and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one. And so that s a direct path to making new odorants. And one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in France    and here s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression    and one of them says   You cannot make a coumarin.  He says to me   I bet you cannot make a coumarin.  Now  coumarin is a very common thing  a material  in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America. And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical  OK  It s the molecule that has made men s fragrances smell the way they do since       to be exact. And the problem is it s a carcinogen. So nobody likes particularly to    you know  aftershave with carcinogens. There are some reckless people  but it s not worth it  OK  So they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations. And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin  and you smooth it out  so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord  so to speak  of coumarin is. And then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules  related or unrelated  that have the same vibrations. And we actually  in this case  I m sorry to say  it happened    it was serendipitous. Because I got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said  look  I ve just found this such a beautiful reaction  that even if this compound doesn t smell of coumarin  I want to do it  it s just such a nifty  one step    I mean  chemists have weird minds    one step     percent yield  you know  and you get this lovely crystalline compound. Let us try it. And I said  first of all  let me do the calculation on that compound  bottom right  which is related to coumarin  but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule. Calculate the vibrations  the purple spectrum is that new fellow  the white one is the old one. And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin. They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin. And this is our new baby  called tonkene. You see  when you re a scientist  you re always selling ideas. And people are very resistant to ideas  and rightly so. Why should new ideas be accepted  But when you put a little    gram vial on the table in front of perfumers and it smells like coumarin  and it isn t coumarin  and you ve found it in three weeks  this focuses everybody s mind wonderfully. And people often ask me  is your theory accepted  And I said  well  by whom  I mean most  you know    there s three attitudes  You re right  and I don t know why  which is the most rational one at this point. You re right  and I don t care how you do it  in a sense  you bring me the molecules  you know. And  You re completely wrong  and I m sure you re completely wrong. OK  Now  we re dealing with people who only want results  and this is the commercial world. And they tell us that even if we do it by astrology  they re happy. But we re not actually doing it by astrology. But for the last three years  I ve had what I consider to be the best job in the entire universe  which is to put my hobby    which is  you know  fragrance and all the magnificent things    plus a little bit of biophysics  a small amount of self taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works. Thank you very much. So  about three years ago I was in London  and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said  I represent a group of people  and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics. We have about     million dollars  and we want to do it well. We want to be in the forefront fields  and we want to do it differently. We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas  and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done. It took me about    seconds to decide that that was a good idea. Three years later  we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo  Ontario. It s the most exciting job I ve ever had. And it s the first time I ve had a job where I m afraid to go away because of everything that s going to happen in this week when I m here. But in any case  what I m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about. So  we think a lot about what really makes science work  The first thing that anybody who knows science  and has been around science  is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong. There is no method. On the other hand  somehow we manage to reason together as a community  from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about. And this is  by the way  something that a democratic society also has to do. So how does it work  Well  my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics. And here are some of the ethical principles. I m not going to read them all to you because I m not in teacher mode. I m in entertain  amaze mode. But one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe. But we re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide  you know  whether I m right or somebody else is right  are the people in our community in the next generation  in    and    years. So it s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we re in  and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere  that makes science work. And being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions  I believe  teaches us about democracy. Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy  but there has been  historically  a relationship between how people think about space and time  and what the cosmos is  and how people think about the society that they live in. And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution. The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science  and that was hierarchical. The earth is in the center  then there are these crystal spheres  the sun  the moon  the planets and finally the celestial sphere  where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place. And Aristotle s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place  which was of course  the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in  and more importantly  the medieval society that  through Christianity  embraced Aristotle and blessed it. And the idea is that everything is defined. Where something is  is defined with respect to this last sphere  the celestial sphere  outside of which is this eternal  perfect realm  where lives God  who is the ultimate judge of everything. So that is both Aristotelian cosmology  and in a certain sense  medieval society. Now  in the   th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought of John Locke and his collaborators. And they were very closely associated. In fact  Newton and Locke were friends. Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand  and a society on the other hand  were closely related. And let me show you. In a Newtonian universe  there s no center    thank you. There are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed  absolute framework of space and time. It s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space  because that s defined  not with respect to say  where other things are  but with respect to this absolute notion of space  which for Newton was God. Now  similarly  in Locke s society there are individuals who have certain rights  properties in a formal sense  and those are defined with respect to some absolute  abstract notions of rights and justice  and so forth  which are independent of what else has happened in the society. Of who else there is  of the history and so forth. There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything  who is God  who is in a certain sense outside the universe  because he has no role in anything that happens  but is in a certain sense everywhere  because space is just the way that God knows where everything is  according to Newton  OK  So this is the foundations of what s called  traditionally  liberal political theory and Newtonian physics. Now  in the   th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the   th century  and which is still going on. It was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory. And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity  is the culmination of that  something that s going on right now. And in this universe there s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch  OK. This universe is described by being a network of relationships. Space is just one aspect  so there s no meaning to say absolutely where something is. There s only where it is relative to everything else that is. And this network of relations is ever evolving. So we call it a relational universe. All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships. And also  if you re embedded in such a network of relationships  your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations. And there s no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything. So this is general relativity  this is quantum theory. This is also  if you talk to legal scholars  the foundations of new ideas in legal thought. They re thinking about the same things. And not only that  they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often. So there s an interesting discussion going on there. This last view of cosmology is called the relational view. So the main slogan here is that there s nothing outside the universe  which means that there s no place to put an explanation for something outside. So in such a relational universe  if you come upon something that s ordered and structured  like this device here  or that device there  or something beautiful  like all the living things  all of you guys in the room     guys  in physics  by the way  is a generic term  men and women. Then you want to know  you re a person  you want to know how is it made. And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was  somehow it made itself. There must be mechanisms of self organization inside the universe that make things. Because there s no place to put a maker outside  as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe. So in a relational universe we must have processes of self organization. Now  Darwin taught us that there are processes of self organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see. So it works. But not only that  if you think about how natural selection works  then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe. That is  natural selection works on properties  like fitness  which are about relationships of some species to some other species. Darwin wouldn t make sense in an Aristotelian universe  and wouldn t really make sense in a Newtonian universe. So a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems. And if you push that all the way down  really  it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational. Now  not only that  but Einstein taught us that gravity is the result of the world being relational. If it wasn t for gravity  there wouldn t be life  because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time  keeping pieces of the world  like the surface of the Earth  out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve. In the   th century  we saw the independent development of two big themes in science. In the biological sciences  they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self organized way. That was the triumph of Neo Darwinism and so forth. And slowly  that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences  the human sciences  economics  et cetera. At the same time  we physicists have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate the discoveries of quantum theory and relativity. And what we ve been working out is the implications  really  of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.   st century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas  the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world  on the one hand  and self organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world  on the other hand. And also  is that in the   st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology  and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve. And what they re evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas  Darwinism and relationalism. Now  if you think about democracy from this perspective  a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests  many different agendas  many different individuals  many different points of view. Each one is incomplete  because you re embedded in a network of relationships. Any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships. And you understand some things better than other things  and because of that there s a continual jostling and give and take  which is politics. And politics is  in the ideal sense  the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society. And I also think that science will never go away and    I m finishing on this line. In fact  I m finished. Science will never go away. I spent the better part of a decade looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide. And I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity. And that moment came on April         . So    years ago  almost  in the middle of the Rwandan genocide  in which         people would be systematically exterminated by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia. On April     in the New York Times  the paper reported that somewhere between         and         people had already been killed in the genocide. It was in the paper    not on the front page. It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage  it was buried in the paper. Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy  and amazingly  genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy. But on April     a wonderfully honest moment occurred. And that was that an American congresswoman named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado met with a group of journalists. And one of the journalists said to her  what's up  What's going on in the U.S. government  Two to         people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda. It's two weeks into the genocide at that time  but of course  at that time you don't know how long it's going to last. And the journalist said  why is there so little response out of Washington  Why no hearings  no denunciations  no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House  What's the deal  And she said    she was so honest    she said   It's a great question. All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado and my office in Washington  we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda  but nobody is calling about the people. The phones just aren't ringing about the people.  And the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it. And that truth is  or was  in the   th century  that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements  we didn't have an endangered people's movement. We had Holocaust education in the schools. Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe  but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust. There's a museum  of course  on the Mall in Washington  right next to Lincoln and Jefferson. I mean  we have owned Never Again culturally  appropriately  interestingly. And yet the politicization of Never Again  the operationalization of Never Again  had never occurred in the   th century. And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows  that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities  we have to make it such. There has to be a role    there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity  and so forth. So that was the   th century. Now here    and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon    there is good news  amazing news  in the   st century  and that is that  almost out of nowhere  there has come into being an anti genocide movement  an anti genocide constituency  and one that looks destined  in fact  to be permanent. It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur. It is comprised of students. There are something like     anti genocide chapters on college campuses around the country. It's bigger than the anti apartheid movement. There are something like     high school chapters devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur. Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.  Hotel Rwanda  watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement. To call it a movement  as with all movements  perhaps  is a little misleading. It's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches. It's got all the ups and the downs of movements. But it has been amazingly successful in one regard  in that it has become  it has congealed into this endangered people's movement that was missing in the   th century. It sees itself  such as it is  the it  as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost  there will be a political price to be paid  for allowing genocide  for not having an heroic imagination  for not being an upstander but for being  in fact  a bystander. Now because it's student driven  there's some amazing things that the movement has done. They have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced  I think     universities in    states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in Sudan. They have a       GENOCIDE number    this is going to sound very kitsch  but for those of you who may not be  I mean  may be apolitical  but interested in doing something about genocide  you dial       GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code  and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is. It will refer you directly to your congressperson  to your U.S. senator  to your governor where divestment legislation is pending. They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide. I think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently are genocide grades. And it takes students to introduce genocide grades. So what you now have when a Congress is in session is members of Congress calling up these    year olds or    year olds and saying  I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide  what do I do to get a C  I just want to get a C. Help me. And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that  and there's always something to do. Now  what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration from the United States  at a time of massive over stretch    military  financial  diplomatic    a whole series of commitments to Darfur that no other country in the world is making. For instance  the referral of the crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court  which the Bush administration doesn't like. The expenditure of   billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep  basically  the people who've been displaced from their homes by the Sudanese government  by the so called Janjaweed  the militia  to keep those people alive until something more durable can be achieved. And recently  or now not that recently  about six months ago  the authorization of a peacekeeping force of        that will go. And that's all the Bush administration's leadership  and it's all because of this bottom up pressure and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis. The bad news  however  to this question of will evil prevail  is that evil lives on. The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so called Janjaweed  these men on horseback with spears and Kalashnikovs. Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families    humanitarian aid  the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated  really  to be edible    are themselves subjected to rape  which is a tool of the genocide that is being used. And the peacekeepers I've mentioned  the force has been authorized  but almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm's way. So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the   th century  and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here  as we speak. Why the limits to the movement  Why is what has been achieved  or what the movement has done  been necessary but not sufficient to the crime  I think there are a couple    there are many reasons    but a couple just to focus on briefly. The first is that the movement  such as it is  stops at America's borders.  It is not a global movement. It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide. And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country makes Americans  sort of  more prone to  I think  want to bring Never Again to life. The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed  that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda  created a space in our society for a consensus that Rwanda was bad and wrong and we wish we had done more  and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of. European governments  for the most part  haven't acknowledged responsibility  and there's nothing to kind of to push back and up against. So this movement  if it's to be durable and global  will have to cross borders  and you will have to see other citizens in democracies  not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide  but actually making it such. Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly. As we saw  they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes. Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering  So one reason is it hasn't gone global. The second is  of course  that at this time in particular in America's history  we have a credibility problem  a legitimacy problem in international institutions. It is structurally really  really hard to do  as the Bush administration rightly does  which is to denounce genocide on a Monday and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no brainer and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments. Now  other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved. Let me be clear. They're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi. But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere  of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world. The recovery's going to take some time. We have to ask ourselves  what now  What do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places  the world's worst suffering  killers  and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost sometime in the future  The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of  and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who  as Chris said  was blown up in Iraq in     . He was the victim of the first ever suicide bomb in Iraq. It's hard to remember  but there was actually a time in the summer of       even after the U.S. invasion  where  apart from looting  civilians were relatively safe in Iraq. Now  who was Sergio  Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name. In addition to being Brazilian  he was described to me before I met him in      as someone who was a cross between James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other. And in the U.N.  you don't get that many people who actually manage to merge those qualities. He was James Bond like in that he was ingenious. He was drawn to the flames  he chased the flames  he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie. He was successful with women. He was Bobby Kennedy like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist  as people always wondered about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way. What he was was a decathlete of nation building  of problem solving  of troubleshooting in the world's worst places and in the world's most broken places. In failing states  genocidal states  under governed states  precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon  and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated. These are the places he was drawn to. He moved with the headlines. He was in the U.N. for    years. He joined at the age of   . Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '  s were wars of independence and decolonization. He was there in Bangladesh dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees    the largest refugee flow in history up to that point. He was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there. He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion. He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence. He was in Lebanon. Amazingly  he was in Lebanon    the U.N. base was used    Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base. Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base. Sergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit by the first ever suicide attack against the United States. People date the beginning of this new era to       but surely       with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks    which Sergio witnessed    those are  in fact  in some ways  the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today. From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '  s. The issues were  of course  ethnic sectarian violence. He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge. Talk about evil prevailing. I mean  here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia. He negotiates with the Serbs. He actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail that he earns the nickname    not Sergio but Serbio while he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations. He then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide  and he's the guy who has to decide    huh  OK  the genocide is over          people have been killed  the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries    into Congo  into Tanzania. I'm Sergio  I'm a humanitarian  and I want to feed those    well  I don't want to feed the killers but I want to feed the two million people who are with them  so we're going to go  we're going to set up camps  and we're going to supply humanitarian aid. But  uh oh  the killers are within the camps. Well  I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves. Let me go door to door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation. And their response  of course  was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that  nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps. So then you have to make the decision. Do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives  Or do you continue feeding the civilians  knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps  literally sharpening their knives for future battle  What do you do  It's all lesser evil terrain in these broken places. Late '  s  nation building is the cause du jour. He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places. He's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy  on currency  on border patrol  on policing. He has to make all these judgments. He's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages. He's been up to that point in    war zones so he's positioned to make better judgments  perhaps  than people who have never done that kind of work. But nonetheless  he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in  again  the world's worst places. And then after Timor       has happened  he's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner  and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out  what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions  bowing out of international law  Do you denounce  Well  if you denounce  you're probably never going to get back in the room. Maybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush    and that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself  unfortunately  his final and tragic appointment to Iraq    the one that resulted in his death. One note on his death  which is so devastating  is that despite predicating the war on Iraq on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in       believe it or not  the Bush administration or the invaders did no planning  no pre war planning  to respond to terrorism. So Sergio    this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness  lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue. Stateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career. Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N. If you represent everyone  in some ways you represent no one. You're un owned. And what the American    the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue  believe it or not  was literally these heroic two American soldiers went into the shaft. Building was shaking. One of them had been at      and lost his buddies on September   th  and yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio. But all they had was a woman's handbag    literally one of those basket handbags    and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters  and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person  the person we most need to turn to now  this shepherd  at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance. And this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio. The good news  for what it's worth  is after Sergio and    others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.  the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting equipment  the shoring wood  the cranes  the things that you would have needed to do the rescue. But it was too late for Sergio. I want to wrap up  but I want to close with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing  which is how I would have framed the question. Here's this guy who got a    year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with  we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away  First  I think  is his relationship to  in fact  evil is something to learn from. He  over the course of his career  changed a great deal. He had a lot of flaws  but he was very adaptive. I think that was his greatest quality. He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers  he would charge up to people who were violating international law  and he would say  you're violating  this is the U.N. Charter. Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing  And they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states  the power of any military or police. He just had the rules  he had the norms  and he tried to use them. And in Lebanon  Southern Lebanon in '    he said to himself and to everybody else  I will never use the word  unacceptable  again. I will never use it. I will try to make it such  but I will never use that word again. But he lunged in the opposite direction. He started  as I mentioned  to get in the room with evil  to not denounce  and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname Serbio  for instance  and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge would black box what had occurred prior to entering the room. But by the end of his life  I think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from. Be in the room  don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries  but don't bracket what happened before you entered the room. Don't black box history. Don't check your principles at the door. And I think that's something that we have to be in the room  whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy or Reagan and Gorbachev. All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room. And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness. You can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person  that regime  is the problem and that you  the United States  are not the problem. Second take away from Sergio's life  briefly. What I take away  and this in some ways is the most important  he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really  really unusual. At a micro level  the individuals around him were visible. He saw them. At a macro level  he thought  you know  we talk about democracy promotion  but we do it in a way sometimes that's an affront to people's dignity. We put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we've spent three billion. It's incredibly important  those people would no longer be alive if the United States  for instance  hadn't spent that money in Darfur  but it's not a way to live. If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us  and as a country  if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries  it would be something of a revolution. Third point  very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear. And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of. There are so many genuine threats in the world. But what Sergio was talking about is  let's calibrate our relationship to the threat. Let's not hype the threat  let's actually see it clearly. We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps. We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats  but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic  of a fear. In times of fear  for instance  one of the things Sergio used to say is  fear is a bad advisor. We lunge towards the extremes when we aren't operating and trying to  again  calibrate our relationship to the world around us. Fourth and final point  he somehow  because he was working in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils  had a humility  of course  and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him. I mean  such an acute awareness of how hard it was. How Sisyphean this task was of mending  and yet aware of that complexity  humbled by it  he wasn't paralyzed by it. And we as citizens  as we go through this experience of the kind of  the crisis of confidence  crisis of competence  crisis of legitimacy  I think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say  ah  Katrina  Iraq    we don't know what we're doing. We can't afford to pull back from the world. It's a question of how to be in the world. And the lesson  I think  of the anti genocide movement that I mentioned  that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do    it'll be many decades  probably  before that happens    but is that if we want to see change  we have to become the change. We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen  for having respect for dignity  and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world. So will evil prevail  Is that the question  I think the short answer is  no  not unless we let it. Thank you. I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started  Jet Propulsion Lab . When they were a bunch of kids  they were kind of very imaginative  very adventurous  as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more. Well  I don't recommend that you try to do that now. Naturally  they blew up a shack  and Caltech  well  then  hey  you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there. So  that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break  you know  in here. As I said  they were adventurous people. As a matter of fact  one of them  who was  kind of  part of a cult which was not too far from here on Orange Grove  and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals. So  that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there. We try to avoid blowing ourselves up. This one I thought I'd show you. Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd. I tried to come like him this morning  but as I walked out  then it was too cold  and I said  I'd better put my shirt back on. But more importantly  the reason I wanted to show this picture  look where the other people are looking  and look where he is looking. Wherever anybody else looks  look somewhere else  and go do something different  you know  and doing that. And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing. And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson that one of my colleagues  you know  put on my wall in my office  and it says   Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path  and leave a trail.  And that's my recommendation to all of you  look what everybody is doing  what they are doing  go do something completely different. Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing  because that doesn't get you very far. In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets  but we also used to have a lot of parties  you know. As you can see  one of our parties  you know  a few years ago. But then a big difference happened about    years ago  after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite  and that's the one you see on the left in there. And here we made     degrees change  we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house. And that was done over a period of a couple of years  and now we are the leading organization  you know  exploring space on all of your behalf. But even when we did that  we had to remind ourselves  sometimes there are setbacks. So you see  on the bottom  that rocket was supposed to go upward  somehow it ended going sideways. So that's what we call the misguided missile. But then also  just to celebrate that  we started an event at JPL for  Miss Guided Missile.  So  we used to have a celebration every year and select    there used to be competition and parades and so on. It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it  I think  well  that's not really proper  you know  these days. So  we do something a little bit more serious. And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl  you know  when we entered one of the floats. That's more on the play side. And on the right side  that's the Rover just before we finished its testing to take it to the Cape to launch it. These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now. So that kind of tells you about  kind of  the fun things  you know  and the serious things that we try to do. But I said I'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have. Video  Morgan Hendry  Beware of Safety is an instrumental rock band. It branches on more the experimental side. There's the improvisational side of jazz. There's the heavy hitting sound of rock. Being able to treat sound as an instrument  and be able to dig for more abstract sounds and things to play live  mixing electronics and acoustics. The music's half of me  but the other half    I landed probably the best gig of all. I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover. Some of the most brilliant engineers I know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them. You've got to do what you want to do. And anyone who tells you you can't  you don't listen to them. Maybe they're right   I doubt it. Tell them where to put it  and then just do what you want to do. I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA. Charles Elachi  Now  moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff  always people ask  why do we explore  Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them  Well  the way I think about it is fairly simple. Somehow     billion years ago there was a Big Bang  and you've heard a little bit about  you know  the origin of the universe. But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination    or lots of people's imagination    somehow from that original Big Bang we have this beautiful world that we live in today. You look outside  you have all that beauty that you see  all that life that you see around you  and here we have intelligent people like you and I who are having a conversation here. All that started from that Big Bang. So  the question is  How did that happen  How did that evolve  How did the universe form  How did the galaxies form  How did the planets form  Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved  Is that very common  Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars  So we literally are all made out of stardust. We started from those stars  we are made of stardust. So  next time you are really depressed  look in the mirror and you can look and say  hi  I'm looking at a star here. You can skip the dust part. But literally  we are all made of stardust. So  what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today. And one of the first  or the easiest  places we can go and explore that is to go towards Mars. And the reason Mars takes particular attention  it's not very far from us. You know  it'll take us only six months to get there. Six to nine months at the right time of the year. It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller  but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth  you know  if you don't take the oceans into account. It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours  so it has weather. So  it's very similar to some extent  and you can see some of the features on it  like the Grand Canyon on Mars  or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars. It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth  except a hell of a lot larger. So it's about the size  you know  of the United States. It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars  which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet. And if you look at the height of it and you compare it to Mount Everest  you see  it'll give you an idea of how large that Mount Olympus  you know  is  relative to Mount Everest. So  it basically dwarfs  you know  Mount Everest here on Earth. So  that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events which have happened on that planet. Recently from one of our satellites  this shows that it's Earth like    we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening. So it is a dynamic planet  and activity is going on as we speak today. And these Rovers  people wonder now  what are they doing today  so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing. This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters  because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it  and you can see what's below the surface. So  this is called Victoria Crater  which is about a few football fields in size. And if you look at the top left  you see a little teeny dark dot. This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite. If I zoom on it  you can see  that's the Rover on the surface. So  that was taken from orbit  we had the camera zoom on the surface  and we actually saw the Rover on the surface. And we actually used the combination of the satellite images and the Rover to actually conduct science  because we can observe large areas and then you can get those Rovers to move around and basically go to a certain location. So  specifically what we are doing now is that Rover is going down in that crater. As I told you  geologists love craters. And the reason is  many of you went to the Grand Canyon  and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon  you see these layers. And what these layers    that's what the surface used to be a million years ago     million years ago      million years ago  and you get deposits on top of them. So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book  and you can learn the history of what happened in the past in that location. So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall of that crater  and the Rover is going down now  measuring  you know  the properties and analyzing the rocks as it's going down  you know  that canyon. Now  it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving down a slope like this. If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself. But we really made sure we tested those Rovers before we got them down    or that Rover    and made sure that it's all working well. Now  when I came last time  shortly after the landing    I think it was  like  a hundred days after the landing    I told you I was surprised that those Rovers are lasting even a hundred days. Well  here we are four years later  and they're still working. Now you say  Charles  you are really lying to us  and so on  but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last    days or     days  because they are solar powered  and Mars is a dusty planet  so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface  and after a while we wouldn't have enough power  you know  to keep them warm. Well  I always say it's important that you are smart  but every once in a while it's good to be lucky. And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on Mars  as you are seeing here  and when the dust devil comes over the Rover  it just cleans it up. It is like a brand new car that you have  and that's literally why they have lasted so long. And now we designed them reasonably well  but that's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing all the science data. Now  the two Rovers  each one of them is  kind of  getting old. You know  one of them  one of the wheels is stuck  is not working  one of the front wheels  so what we are doing  we are driving it backwards. And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint  you know  it's not working very well  so it's walking like this  and we can move the arm  you know  that way. But still they are producing a lot of scientific data. Now  during that whole period  a number of people got excited  you know  outside the science community about these Rovers  so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these Rovers are being viewed by people other than the science community. So let me go on the next short video. By the way  this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place  you know  about four years ago. Video  Okay  we have parachute aligned. Okay  deploy the airbags. Open. Camera. We have a picture right now. Yeah  CE  That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this. Video  Now  if there is life  the Dutch will find it. What is he doing  What is that  CE  Not too bad. So anyway  let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet. As I said earlier  it looked very much like Earth  so you see sand dunes. It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken from the Sahara Desert or somewhere  and you'd have believed me  but these are pictures taken from Mars. But one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region  you know  of Mars  close to the North Pole  because we see ice caps  and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding  so it's very much like you have in northern Canada. And we wanted to find out    and we see all kinds of glacial features on it. So  we wanted to find out  actually  what is that ice made of  and could that have embedded in it some organic  you know  material. So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars  called Phoenix  and that spacecraft will land    days  seven hours and    seconds from now  so you can adjust your watch. So it's on May    around just before five o'clock our time here on the West Coast  actually we will be landing on another planet. And as you can see  this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars  but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show  you know  in    days  I'll show you  kind of  a little bit of what's going to happen. Video  That's what we call the seven minutes of terror. So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it. So this was launched about nine months ago. We'll be coming in at        miles per hour  and in seven minutes we have to stop and touch the surface very softly so we don't break that lander. Ben Cichy  Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission. It's the first mission that's going to try to land near the North Pole of Mars  and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet. Lynn Craig  Where there tends to be water  at least on Earth  there tends to be life  and so it's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet in the past. Erik Bailey  The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling at        miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt in a soft way in a very short amount of time. BC  We enter the Martian atmosphere. We're    miles above the surface of Mars. And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell. EB  Looks kind of like an ice cream cone  more or less. BC  And on the front of it is this heat shield  this saucer looking thing that has about a half inch of essentially what's cork on the front of it  which is our heat shield. Now  this is really special cork  and this cork is what's going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience. Rob Grover  Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft  and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down. BC  From this point  we're going to decelerate from        miles an hour down to     miles an hour. EB  The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun. RG  The temperature of the heat shield can reach       degrees Fahrenheit. EB  The inside doesn't get very hot. It probably gets about room temperature. Richard Kornfeld  There is this window of opportunity within which we can deploy the parachute. EB  If you fire the 'chute too early  the parachute itself could fail. The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart. And that would be bad. BC  In the first    seconds after we deploy the parachute  we'll decelerate from     miles an hour to a relatively slow     miles an hour. We no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry  so we jettison the heat shield  exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars. LC  After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed  the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really is from the ground. BC  We've lost    percent of our entry velocity. So  we're    percent of the way to where we want to be. But that last one percent  as it always seems to be  is the tricky part. EB  Now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it's going to get rid of its parachute. BC  We separate from the lander going     miles an hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars        feet. That's like taking two Empire State Buildings and stacking them on top of one another. EB  That's when we separate from the back shell  and we're now in free fall. It's a very scary moment  a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time. LC  So it's in a free fall  but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land. EB  And then it has to light up its engines  right itself  and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely. BC  Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from Mars to get to Earth. And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes. So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over. EB  We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely. BC  EDL is this immense  technically challenging problem. It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour. It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem. CE  Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here. So it will be a very tense moment  you know  as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet. So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing. So we are in the process  as we speak  of actually designing the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars. So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you  kind of  the steps we go through. It's very similar to what you do when you design your product. As you saw a little bit earlier  when we were doing the Phoenix one  we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing. So we have to study all kinds of different materials  the shape that we want to do. In general we don't try to please the customer here. What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective  you know  an efficient kind of machine. First we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can. And we really love being close to the art center  because we have  as a matter of fact  one of the alumni from the art center  Eric Nyquist  had put a series of displays  far out displays  you know  in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room  just to get people to think wildly about things. We have a bunch of Legos. So  as I said  this is a playground for adults  where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different designs. Then we get a little bit more serious  so we have what we call our CAD CAMs and all the engineers who are involved  or scientists who are involved  who know about thermal properties  know about design  know about atmospheric interaction  parachutes  all of these things  which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent  so to see  does that meet the requirement that we need. On the right  also  we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going. If you are going to Jupiter  you have a very high radiation  you know  environment. It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor. So just imagine  you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work. So these are kind of some of the little challenges  you know  that we have to face. If we are doing entry  we have to do tests of parachutes. You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day  you know  if that happened  so we have to test  because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds. We are coming at extremely high speeds  and we are deploying them to slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests. To give you an idea of the size  you know  of that parachute relative to the people standing there. Next step  we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them  you know  in the lab at JPL  in what we call our Mars Yard. We kick them  we hit them  we drop them  just to make sure we understand how  where would they break. And then we back off  you know  from that point. And then we actually do the actual building and the flight. And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car. That big shield that you see outside  that's a heat shield which is going to protect it. And that will be basically built over the next year  and it will be launched June a year from now. Now  in that case  because it was a very big Rover  we couldn't use airbags. And I know many of you  kind of  last time afterwards said well  that was a cool thing to have    those airbags. Unfortunately this Rover is  like  ten times the size of the  you know  mass wise  of the other Rover  or three times the mass. So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it. And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface because we didn't want to contaminate the surface  we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs. So we came up with this ingenious idea  which is used here on Earth for helicopters. Actually  the lander will come down to about     feet and hover above that surface for     feet  and then we have a sky crane which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface. Hopefully it all will work  you know  it will work that way. And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist. What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around  it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks. So it will have an arm which will take samples  put them in an oven  crush and analyze them. But also  if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff  we have a little laser system which will actually zap the rock  evaporate some of it  and actually analyze what's coming from that rock. So it's a little bit like  Star Wars   you know  but it's real. It's real stuff. And also to help you  to help the community so you can do ads on that Rover  we are going to train that Rover to actually in addition to do this  to actually serve cocktails  you know  also on Mars. So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of  you know  fun things we are doing on Mars. I thought I'd go to  The Lord of the Rings  now and show you some of the things we have there. Now   The Lord of the Rings  has two things played through it. One  it's a very attractive planet    it just has the beauty of the rings and so on. But for scientists  also the rings have a special meaning  because we believe they represent  on a small scale  how the Solar System actually formed. Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed  that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun  a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together  and they formed bigger rocks  and then that's how the planets  you know  were formed. So  the idea is  by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale  so it's like a test bed for it. So  let me show you a little bit on what that Saturnian system looks like. First  I'm going to fly you over the rings. By the way  all of this is real stuff. This is not animation or anything like this. This is actually taken from the satellite that we have in orbit around Saturn  the Cassini. And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings  which are the particles. Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles. So that's why you have these gaps  is because a small satellite  you know  is being formed in that location. Now  you think that those rings are very large objects. Yes  they are very large in one dimension  in the other dimension they are paper thin. Very  very thin. What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself. And that's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one. So  think about it as a paper thin  huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles  which is rotating. And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form  each one looking very different and very odd  and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this  and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain what these things look like  or why they formed that way. Well  there were two satellites which were particularly interesting. One of them is called Enceladus. It's a satellite which was all made of ice  and we measured it from orbit. Made of ice. But there was something bizarre about it. If you look at these stripes in here  what we call tiger stripes  when we flew over them  all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature  which said that those stripes are warmer than the rest of the planet. So as we flew by away from it  we looked back. And guess what  We saw geysers coming out. So this is a Yellowstone  you know  of Saturn. We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet  which indicate that most likely there is an ocean  you know  below the surface. And somehow  through some dynamic effect  we're having these geysers which are being  you know  emitted from it. And the reason I showed the little arrow there  I think that should say    miles  we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of. That was  unclear  also    you know  because we were worried about the risk of it  but it worked pretty well. We flew at the top of it  and we found that there is a fair amount of organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice. And over the next few years  as we keep orbiting  you know  Saturn  we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements. Now  another satellite also attracted a lot of attention  and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting  it's a satellite bigger than our moon  and it has an atmosphere. And that atmosphere is very    as dense as our own atmosphere. So if you were on Titan  you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder  and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane. Now  methane gets people all excited  because it's organic material  so immediately people start thinking  could life have evolved in that location  when you have a lot of organic material. So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call a pre biotic planet  because it's so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material  and therefore life could have evolved on it. So it could be Earth  frozen three billion years ago before life actually started on it. So that's getting a lot of interest  and to show you some example of what we did in there  we actually dropped a probe  which was developed by our colleagues in Europe  we dropped a probe as we were orbiting Saturn. We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan. And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down. Just looked like the coast of California for me. You see the rivers which are coming along the coast  and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island  and that looks like an ocean. And then with an instrument we have on board  a radar instrument  we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here  so it looks very much like Earth. It looks like there are rivers on it  there are oceans or lakes  we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it. So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except because it's so cold  it could not be water  you know  because water would have frozen. What it turned out  that all that we are seeing  all this liquid   is made of  hydrocarbon and ethane and methane  similar to what you put in your car. So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth  but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material. So if you were on Mars    sorry  on Titan  you don't have to worry about four dollar gasoline. You just drive to the nearest lake  stick your hose in it  and you've got your car filled up. On the other hand  if you light a match the whole planet will blow up. So in closing  I said I want to close by a couple of pictures. And just to kind of put us in perspective  this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind Saturn  looking towards the Sun. The Sun is behind Saturn  so we see what we call  forward scattering   so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom. There is a    I'm not sure you can see it very well  but on the top left  around    o'clock  there is a little teeny dot  and that's Earth. You barely can see ourselves. So what I did  I thought I'd zoom on it. So as you zoom in  you know  you can see Earth  you know  just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center. So thank you very much. My name is Ursus Wehrli  and I would like to talk to you this morning about my project  Tidying Up Art. First of all    any questions so far  First of all  I have to say I'm not from around here. I'm from a completely different cultural area  maybe you noticed  I mean  I'm wearing a tie  first. And then secondly  I'm a little bit nervous because I'm speaking in a foreign language  and I want to apologize in advance  for any mistakes I might make. Because I'm from Switzerland  and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like if we Swiss try to speak American. But don't worry    I don't have trouble with English  as such. I mean  it's not my problem  it's your language after all. I am fine. After this presentation here at TED  I can simply go back to Switzerland  and you have to go on talking like this all the time. So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book. It's called  Tidying Up Art  and it's  as you can see  it's more or less a picture book. So the reading would be over very quickly. But since I'm here at TED  I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way  in the spirit of TED here  and I managed to do some slides here for you. I'd like to show them around so we can just  you know    Actually  I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures    even better. So Tidying Up Art  I mean  I have to say  that's a relatively new term. You won't be familiar with it. I mean  it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years  and it all started out with this picture of the American artist  Donald Baechler I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long. Yeah  I kind of felt sorry for him. And it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day. So I decided to give him a little support  and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other. Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable. And it was great. With this experience  I started to look more closely at modern art. Then I realized how  you know  the world of modern art is particularly topsy turvy. And I can show here a very good example. It's actually a simple one  but it's a good one to start with. It's a picture by Paul Klee. And we can see here very clearly  it's a confusion of color. Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors. The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture    the whole thing is unstructured. We don't know  maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry  I mean       maybe he had to catch a plane  or something. We can see here he started out with orange  and then he already ran out of orange  and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square. And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture. We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original     red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares. Yeah  that's great. So I mean  that's just tidying up for beginners. I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced. What can you say  What a mess. I mean  you see  everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space. If my room back home had looked like this  my mother would have grounded me for three days. So I'd like to    I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture. And that's really advanced tidying up. Yeah  you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point  but that's actually more in Switzerland. We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time. We are only happy when things are in order. But to go on  here is a very good example to see. This is a picture by Joan Miro. And yeah  we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background. And yeah  it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone. And this is my       you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space. It's more economical and also more efficient. With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture. But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical. So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this  I brought along the patents  the specifications for some of these works  because I've had my working methods patented at the Eidgen ssische Amt f r Geistiges Eigentum in Bern  Switzerland. I'll just quote from the specification.  Laut den Kunstpr fer Dr. Albrecht     It's not finished yet.  Laut den Kunstpr fer Dr. Albrecht G tz von Ohlenhusen wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich gesch tzt welche die Kunst durch spezifisch aufger umte Regelm ssigkeiten des allgemeinen Formenschatzes neue Wirkungen zu erzielen m glich wird.  Ja  well I could have translated that  but you would have been none the wiser. I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway. I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people  that's why these patents are sometimes necessary. I would like to do a short test with you. Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning. So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah. The right hand is the one we write with  apart from the left handers. And now  I'll count to three. I mean  it still looks very orderly to me. Now  I'll count to three  and on the count of three I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK  One  two  three. You can see now  that's a good example  even behaving in an orderly  systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos. So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting. This is a painting by the artist  Niki de Saint Phalle. And I mean  in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict. But in the tidied up version  it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball. Yeah  it's a    this one here  that's much better. That's a picture by Keith Haring. I think it doesn't matter. So  I mean  this picture has not even got a proper title. It's called  Untitled  and I think that's appropriate. So  in the tidied up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop. This is Keith Haring looked at statistically. One can see here quite clearly  you can see we have    pale green elements  of which one is in the form of a circle. Or here  for example  we have    pink squares with only one pink curve. I mean  that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring's various works  in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares. And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future. One can obviously also make combinations. For example  with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots. You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee. In the end  one has a list with which one then can arrange. Then you categorize it  then you file it  put that file in a filing cabinet  put it in your office and you can make a living doing it. Yeah  from my own experience. So I'm    Actually  I mean  here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad. This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler. But I think it could still benefit from more discipline. And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this. And here  that's one of my favorites. Tidying up Rene Magritte    this is really fun. You know  there is a    I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this. It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels. So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy  five star hotel. And you know  there you had this little sign    I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read   Please tidy room.  I don't know if you have them over here. So actually  my room there hasn't been tidied once daily  but three times a day. So after a while I decided to have a little fun  and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space. Like books  clothes  toothbrush  etc. And it was great. By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place. But then one morning  I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh. And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since     . And when I returned it looked like this. Yeah  at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming. OK  I mean  I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you. This is a picture by Rene Magritte  and I'd like you all to inwardly    like in your head  that is    to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this. Yeah  I would actually prefer to do it more this way. Some people would make apple pie out of it. But it's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements. And it's not done  as many people imagine  with the computer  otherwise it would look like this. So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time. Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock  for example. It's    oh  no  it's    that's a really hard one. But after a while  I just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans. Or you could go into three dimensional art. Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim. Here I just brought it back to its original state. But yeah  and it's great  you can even go  you know    Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art. The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels. And then I    this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up. So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method  Georges Seurat  and I collected together all his dots. And now they're all in here. You can count them afterwards  if you like. You see  that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea  it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it. There is no textbooks  I mean  not yet  anyway. I mean  it's  the future we will create.  But to round things up I would like to show you just one more. This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel. That's how it looks like when you send everyone home. Yeah  maybe you're asking yourselves where old Bruegel's people went  Of course  they're not gone. They're all here. I just piled them up. So I'm    yeah  actually I'm kind of finished at that moment. And for those who want to see more  I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop. And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist. But before leaving I would like to show you  I'm working right now on another    in a related field with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field. And I started to bring some order into some flags. Here    that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack. And then maybe before I leave you ... yeah  I think  after you have seen that I have to leave anyway. Yeah  that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly  so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler. Thank you very much. Welcome to        feet. Let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you. Once upon a time  I did a book called  How Buildings Learn.  Today's event you might call  How Mountains Teach.  A little background  For    years I've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare    or in some cases  non existent. It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter  but you know  next        years and the last        years    basically civilization's story so far. So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco. It's an incubator for about a dozen projects  all having to do with continuity over the long term. Our core project is a rather ambitious folly    I suppose  a mythic undertaking  to build a        year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period. And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious. Go to the clock. And what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago. It's the first working prototype of the clock. It's about nine feet high. Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London  and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there. So the design problem for today is going to be  how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick  save time beautifully for     centuries  Well  this was the first solution. Alexander Rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps. And it looked like a way to go  until you start thinking about  what does deep time do to a building  Well  this is what deep time does to a building. This is the Parthenon. It's only       years old  and look what happened to it. Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever  because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones. And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for. That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable. Even the most durable and intactable buildings  like the pyramids of Giza  are in bad shape when you look up close. They've been looted inside and out. And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things. So we got to thinking  if you can't put things safely in a building  where can you safely put them  We thought  OK  underground. How about underground with a view  Underground in a place that's really solid. So the obvious answer was  we need a mountain. You don't want just any mountain. You need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for        years. So here's an image of the long view of the search problem. And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain  so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest. We looked at mesas in New Mexico. We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona. Then Roger Kennedy  who was the director of the National Parks Service  led us to Eastern Nevada  to America's newest and oldest national park  which is called Great Basin National Park. It's right on the eastern border of Nevada. It's the highest range in the state    over        feet. And you'll notice that on the left  on the left  on the west  it's very steep  and on the right it's gentle. This place is remote. It's over     miles from any major city. It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad. And it's    the only thing that goes by is what's called America's loneliest highway  U.S.   . Now  inside the yellow line here  on the right is    that's all national park. Inside the green line is national forest. And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land. Now  as it happened  that two mile long strip right in the middle  this vertical  was available because it was private land. And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here  who started the process  Long Now was able to get that two mile long strip of land. And now let's look at the grand truth of what's there. We're in Pole Canyon  looking west up the western escarpment of Mount Washington  which is        feet on top. Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone. That's a       foot thick formation  and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock. It would be a pilgrimage to get to it  it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is. So last June  the Long Now board  some staff and some donors and advisors  made a two week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate  one  if it's the right mountain  and two  if it's the right mountain  how it might actually work for us. Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem. He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work. It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure. It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey. In this case it might well be an image of the clock. Then there's the point of embarkation  that is  the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest. Then    this is a nice image of it  there's the labyrinth. The labyrinth is a concept  it's like a twilight zone  it's a place where it's difficult  where you get disoriented  maybe you get scared    but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration. Then there should always be in sight the draw    a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there. Now Brian Eno  who's been in the thick of the Long Now process  spent two years making a C.D. called  January        and it's  Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now.  Based on    parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed  so that a peal of    bells makes a different peal every day for        years. The Hillis algorithm.    factorial gives you that number. And in fact  pretty soon we'll hear the sound. January     . There it is. OK  back to Danny's list. Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax. The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to. And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff. Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect. Then there's the return. You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world  so you have time to assimilate what you've learned. And then  how about a memento  Number seven. At the end of it there's something physical  a kind of reward that you take away. It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain. Something that's just yours. How do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we're talking about  This is not a normal building project. What do you look for  What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions  Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here  that's national park. That's sacrosanct    you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest. There's possibilities. The borders are important. Other elements were mines  weather  approaches and elevation. And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there. It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines. They're the world's oldest living thing. People think they're just the size of shrubs  but that's not actually true. There are trees on that mountain that are       years old and still living. The wood is so solid it's like stone  and it lasts for a long time. So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain  some of them go back        years. The stone itself is absolutely beautiful  sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there. We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition. Now  if you guys have a pine cone handy  now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it  especially on the end. That's interesting. You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience. Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered  led by a theory. Edmund Schulman in the     s had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline  and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine called   Longevity under Adversity in Conifers.  And then  based on that principle  he started looking around at the various trees at Timberline  and realized that the bristlecone pines    he found some in the White Mountains that were over       years old. Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right. OK  onto the mines. The first asking price for the property when we looked at it in      was one billion dollars for     acres and a couple of mines. Because the owner said   There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain.  And we said   Wow  that's great. Listen  we'll counter. How about zero  And we're a non profit foundation  you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction. All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars.  Well  a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth  and by and by  thanks to Mitch and Jay  we were able to buy the whole property for         dollars. This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it. It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten  a little bit of tungsten  left over  that's the kind of mine it was. But it goes a mile and a half in a straight line  due east into the range  into very interesting territory    except that  as you'll see when we go inside in a minute  we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale. And shale is not quite completely competent rock. Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring. The shale would like some shoring  and so parts of it are caved in in there. That's Ben Roberts from    he's the bat specialist from the National Park. But there are many wonders back in there  like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers. OK  here's another mine that's up on top of the property  and it dates back to     . That's what the property was originally built around    it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine. In fact  it was the highest operating mine in Nevada  and it ran year round. You can imagine what it was like in the winter at        feet. You may recognize a couple of the miners there. There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena  which is the lead silver thing. They didn't find any. They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine. It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon. And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep. And they also found four species of bats in there. Now  almost all those mines  by the way  meet underneath the mountain. They don't quite  but it's something to think about. They don't quite meet. Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather. Way more interesting than Monterey even today. And so one Tuesday morning last June  there we were. Woke up in the morning    the mountain was covered with snow. That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again  thanks to Mitch Kapor  we're building up there. And it's a pretty interesting scene. This is  on the left there  the joyful lady is Pat Irwin  who's the regional head of the National Forest Service  and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there. We want a temporary use permit for the clock  eventually           year temporary use permit. The weather station's pretty interesting. Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station. It runs on solar  and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman  Montana  where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco  where we put the data in real time up on our website. And there you see a week of weather at       feet on Mount Washington. Let's go to approaches. As it happens  there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington  just a few old mining roads like this  so you have to bushwhack everywhere. But there's no bears  and there's no poison oak  and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time. You can hike for days and not encounter anybody. Well  here's a potential approach. You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon. It's this beautiful world all of its own  surrounded by cliffs  and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom  until you get to this barrier  and it actually presents a problem. So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach. Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain. You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain. And from where you're standing at       feet in the valley  it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at       feet. And you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at        feet  where there's a bit of a problem. Now  Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition   Make the clock inaccessible. The harder it is to get to  the more people will value it.  And check    those are     foot vertical walls there. So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route  and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck at       feet and headed up the mountain. Now  as you gain elevation your IQ goes down    but your emotional affect goes up  which is great for having a mythic experience  whether you want to or not. In fact  Danny Hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can't do in his head. Now  I happened to be on the radio with Alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs  and he said  quote   There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways.  Now  he's a rock climber  but you know  he's our executive director. I don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs. I'm saying   Be careful  be careful  be careful.  Then he starts going up  and the next thing I hear is   I'm half way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up    degrees. It's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien.  And I'm going   Careful  careful. Please be careful.  And then  of course  the next thing I hear is   I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here.  And he dashed across the top of the mountains. In fact  there he is. That's Alexander Rose. First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington  and a solo ascent at that. This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them. We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered. How about Zander's Crevice  No. So we finally decided on Alexander's Siq. Zander's Siq is named after    some of you have been to Petra  there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra called the Siq  and so this is the Siq. And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image  and I'm not sure you can. Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there  and that brings it out. Now  Danny and I were up at this same area one day  and Danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs  which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it  and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view. And the people toiling up the mountain could see them  these tiny little people up there  incredibly halfway up the cliff. How did they get there  Do I have to do that  And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth. You can get another angle on Danny's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there. And you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine  that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day  and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate. So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on  the clock will keep perfectly good time. So here we're looking from the south  look north. This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs  that's some of the Long Now land in those trees. And if you go up there and look back  then you'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain. That's the long view. That's    miles to the horizon. And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs. That's a different place to be. It's        feet and it's exquisite. Now  if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs  it's     foot  just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot  there is a     foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq. That's what it looks like looking down it. We should probably put in a rail or something. Over on the eastern side it's gentle  as you can see. And that's not snow    that's what the white limestone looks like. You also see there a bighorn sheep. Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming. And they're doing pretty well  but they've got a bit of trouble. This is Danny Hillis  and he's figuring out a design problem. he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain. because the real peak is hidden around the corner. This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest. And as it turned out the answer is  yes  that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak  and that might be conjured with. We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this. One is the experience of the mountain. Another is the experience in the mountain. And the third is the experience from the mountain  which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny  and if you look off to the right  out there     miles across to the Schell Creek range. In the front  there are    ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains. In fact  there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air. One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch  and I'll take you there for a minute. It's a very nice ranch. Alfalfa and cattle  run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham  and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work. And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going. This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range. And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end  you'll see what the valley used to look like. This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years. And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley  because those    ranches with their        acres dominate a     square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on  and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition  and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park  and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell. OK  let's take one more look at the mountain itself. The clock experience should be profound  but from the outside it should be invisible. Now  at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave. It's only about    feet deep  but what if it were deepened from inside  You excavated from somewhere  came up from inside and deepened it. And then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in  that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite. And this stone takes a perfect polish. You'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the        year clock. And it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain  and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside. This is architecture not made by building  but by what you very carefully take away. So that's what the mountain taught us. Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain. All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them. It's not a clock in a mountain    it's a mountain clock. Now  the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything. They say   pin peya obe     welcome to the mountain. Thank you. I have  like  a thing about sleeping. I don't sleep that much  and I've come to this thing about  like  not sleeping much as being a great virtue  after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment  or something. And now I really like sort of sitting up  you know. But for years I've been sitting up and I think that  like  my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia. I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly. Sometimes I used to walk more at night. I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting. And sometimes    actually  once it was on Page Six in the Post  that I was cruising this guy  like  sort of  whatever  but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on. And so I was following this guy. And I took a picture of his shoes  and we thanked each other and just went on our way. But I do that all the time. As a matter of fact  I think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye. Because I feel like  you know  there are so many images out there  so many clothes out there. And the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken  of course  or very  very surprising. And often  I'm driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt  or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I'd never seen happen before. And so I'd make the car stop  and I'd get out of the car and walk  and see that in fact there wasn't a hole  but it was a trick of my eye  it was a shadow  you know. Or if there was a hole I'd think like  oh damn  there was actually someone thought of that thought already. Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore. I don't know where inspiration comes from. It does not come for me from research. I don't get necessarily inspired by research. As a matter of fact  one of the most fun things I've ever  ever done in my whole life  was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York. I read  Peter and the Wolf  with this beautiful band from Juilliard. And I did like  you know  the narrator  and I read it. And I saw this really smart critic who I love. This woman  Joan Acocella  who's a friend of mine  and she came backstage and she said  oh  you know  Isaac  did you know that  talking about Stalinism and talking about  you know  like the '  s in Russia. And I said  how do I know about Stalinism  I know about a wolf and a bird and  you know  he ate the bird  and then in the end you hear  you know  you hear the bird squeaking  or something  you know  So I don't really know that. I don't really    actually I do my own kind of research  you know. If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an   th century opera  or something like that  I will do a lot of research  because it's interesting  not because it's what I'm supposed to do. I'm very  very  very inspired by movies. The color of movies and the way light makes the colors  light from behind the projection  or light from the projection  makes the colors look so impossible. And anyway  roll this little clip  I'll just show you. I sit up at night and I watch movies and I watch women in movies a lot. And I think about  you know  their roles  and about how you have to  like  watch what your daughters look at. Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time. Whether they're kind of glorified in this way  or whether they're kind of  you know  ironically glorified  or whether they're  you know  sort of denigrated  or ironically denigrated. I go back to color all the time. Color is something that motivates me a lot. It's rarely color that I find in nature  although  you know  juxtaposed next to artificial color  natural color is so beautiful. So that's what I do. I study color a lot. But for the most part  I think  like  how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood  How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo  I mean  that's just not possible  you know. And so that's what makes me lie awake at night  I guess  you know. I want to show you    I'm also like a big    I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often  and that's another thing that motivates me a lot. People say  oh  do that. An astrologer tells me to do something. So I do it. When I was about     an astrologer told me that I was going to meet the man of my dreams  and that his name was going to be Eric  right  So  you know  for years I would go to bars and  sort of  anyone I met whose name was Eric I was humping immediately  or something. And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just  you know  walk into a room and just go like   Eric   And anybody who would turn around I would  sort of  make a beeline for. And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago. The last card he pulled  which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know  sort of spats and this  you know  a minstrel singer  right  I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act. So actually  check this out. Very embarrassing. The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother. It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers. I was dating this guy  right  And this has to do with being happy  I swear. I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year  right. And we were getting serious  so we decided to invite them all to dinner  our parents. And we  you know  sort of introduced them to each other. My mother was  sort of  very sensitive to his mother  who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing. You know  homosexuality  right  So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said   Are you kidding  They have the greatest life together. They eat out  they see shows.  They eat out  they see shows. That's the name of the show  they eat out  they    that's on my tombstone when I die.  He ate out  he saw shows   right  So in editing these clips  I didn't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub. So you'll have to  like  go check it out and come see me or something. Because it's mortifying  and yet it feels ... I don't know how to put this. I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing  you know. And at least  you know  in my case  because if I just do one thing all the time  I don't know  I get very  very bored. I bore very easily. And you know  I don't say that I do everything well  I just say that I do a lot of things  that's all. And I kind of try not to look back  you know. Except  I guess  that's what staying up every night is about. Like  looking back and thinking  what a fool you made of yourself  you know. But I guess that's okay. Right  Because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything  and not just one  you know. You don't master feeling lousy about one thing. Yeah  exactly. I will show you this next thing  speaking of costumes for operas. I do work with different choreographers. I work with Twyla Tharp a lot  and I work with Mark Morris a lot  who is one of my best friends. And I designed three operas with him  and the most recent one   King Arthur.  I'd been very ingrained in the dance world since I was a teenager. I went to performing arts high school  where I was an actor. And many of my friends were ballet dancers. Again  I don't know where inspiration comes from. I don't know where it comes from. I started making puppets when I was a kid. Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from  puppets  right. And then performing arts high school. There I was in high school  meeting dancers and acting. And somehow  from there  I got interested in design. I went to Parsons School of Design and then I began my career as a designer. I don't really think of myself as a designer  I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer. And frankly  I don't really know what to call myself. I think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as. It's just that. But I must say  this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time  that is what    I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer. You always have to be slightly bored with everything. And if you're not  you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything. But I am really a little bored with everything. I always say to my partner  Marisa Gardini  who books everything    she books everything and she makes everything happen. And she makes all the deals. And I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program. Too much time on computer bridge  which is  you know  like that's so ... somehow  like  about ten years ago I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a T.V. studio  like for a day show. Some kind of day talk show. Because it's all of these things that I love all kind of in one place. And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing  and do another thing and talk about it  right  And so I had this T.V. show. And that was a very  very  very big part of my process. Actually  could you roll the clip  please  This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie. Hi there. Rosie O'Donnell  Hello  Ben. IM  Look how cute she looks with this  just a slick back. Man  Her grandmother says   Delish   IM  Ah  wow  delish. All right. So now where should I position myself  I want to stay out of the way. I don't want to be    okay. Here we go. Do you get nervous  Ashleigh  Ashleigh  Doing what  ROD  Cutting hair. A  Cutting hair  Never  never. I don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous. IM  You look so cute already  by the way. ROD  You like it  All right. IM  Do you have a problem with looking cute  You want to look cute. ROD  Of course I want to look cute. IM  Just checking  because some people want to look  you know  aggressively ugly. ROD  No  not me  no. IM  You read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow  like  really messed up  you know what I mean  And there's got to be some way to do that  Rosie. Because just because if you're fabulously rich  and fabulously famous  does that mean you shouldn't have kids  because you know they're going to end up getting messed up  ROD  No  but it means that your priority has to be their well being first  I think. But you have to make the decision for yourself. My kids are seven  who the hell knows. They're going to be like    and in rehab. And they're going to be playing this clip   I'm such a good mother.  My God  this is the shortest I've ever had. IM  It looks good  yeah  A  I was going to ask you  has your hair ever been    ROD  No  It's all right    go crazy. IM  I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here. A  Oh no  we're just staging  ROD  We're just staging it. IM  Are you freaking out  You look so cute. ROD  No  I love it. It's the new me. IM  Oh  it's so fabulous  ROD  Flock of Rosie. Wooo  IM  So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world  right. I mean  like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that. That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring. Actually  I read this great quote the other day  which was   Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die.  Right  And then I realized  that was on my website  and then it said  like  you know  the quote was attributed to me and I thought  oh  I said something  you know  in an interview. I forgot that I said that. But it's really true. I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye. I'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook. And I often look at things as though they're food. Like I say  oh  you know  would you serve a rotten chicken  Then how could you serve  you know  a beat up old dress or something. How could you show a beat up old dress  I always relate things to kitchen ry. And so I think that's what it all boils down to. Everything boils down to that. So check this out. This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world. It's  like  this website. It's got a lot of different things on it. It's a polymathematical website. We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments. And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world. And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows  And again  I don't say it's good  I just think it's not boring  right  And here is the last bit. Chef  Do you  IM  Yeah  but I can never find buttermilk  ever. Chef  Oh. IM  You can't find buttermilk at Citarella  you can't find buttermilk. Chef  You can't  IM  It's always low fat buttermilk. Chef  No  but that's all it is. IM  Is that all it is  Chef  Oh  you don't know  Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something interesting. IM  You know what  Stop laughing. It's not funny. Just because I don't know that whole    that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk. Sorry  what  Chef  Well  here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal. In the old days when they used to make butter  you know how you make butter  IM  Churns  Chef  For cream  IM  Yeah  exactly. Chef  So you take heavy  high fat milk  which is cream  and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water. The liquid is actually that clear liquid. If you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream  it's actually buttermilk. And that's what it was in the early days. And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things. Now  the buttermilk that you get is actually low fat or skim milk. IM  Excuse me  I didn't know. All right  Chef  The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious. IM  Yeah  it is  exactly. So who would think that it was low fat  Well  that's it. Thank you very much. Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it. Thanks. Bye. I have a story  a story that I would like to share with you. And it's an African story. It is a story of hope  resilience and glamour. There was Hollywood. Then came Bollywood. Today we have Nollywood  the third largest film industry in the world. In      alone  almost       films were made in Nigeria. Now  try to imagine        films wrapped  distributed  every week in the streets of Lagos  Nigeria and West Africa. Some estimates put the value of this industry at     million dollars. It has created thousands  if not tens of thousands of jobs. And it's expanding. But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement. This is something that happened without foreign investment  without government aid  and actually  it happened against all odds  in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy. The industry is    years old. And so maybe you're thinking now  why  how  an Italian filmmaker based in Boston is so interested in this story  And so I think I have to tell you just a few words  a few things about my personal life  because I think there is a connection. My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia. My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa. And I was born in Zambia. Even though I left when I was only three years old  I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life. And it really was a place where I learned to walk. I think I uttered the first words  and my family bought their first home. So when we came back to Italy  and one of the things that I remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories. It seemed that for our neighbors and friends  Africa was either this exotic place  this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination  or the place of horror  famine. And so we were always caught in this stereotype. And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives  and have dreams like we all have. So when I read in a newspaper in the business page the story of Nollywood  I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions. Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do  and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me. I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker in residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University. And we really look how digital technology is changing  and how young  independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost. So when I proposed the story  I really had all the support to make this film. And not only had the support  I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure. Aimee Corrigan  a very talented and young photographer  and Robert Caputo  a friend and a mentor  who is a veteran of National Geographic  and told me   You know  Franco  in    years of covering Africa  I don't know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun.  So we went to Lagos in October     . And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa  a wonderful  talented film director who is with us tonight. The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood  of this incredible film industry  following Bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption  called  Checkpoint.  Police corruption. And he had nine days to make it. We thought this was a good story. In the meantime  we had to cover Nollywood  and we talked to a lot of filmmakers. But I don't want to create too many expectations. I would like to show you six minutes. And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience. There are several themes from the documentary  but they are re edited and made for you  OK  So I guess it's a world premier. Man  Action. Milverton Nwokedi  You cut a nice movie with just        dollars in Nigeria here. And you shoot in seven days. Peace Piberesima  We're doing films for the masses. We're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses. They can afford to watch their  Robocop  and whatever. Mahmood Ali Balogun  I think filmmaking in Nigeria  for those who work in it  is a kind of subsistence filmmaking    what they do to make a living. It's not the fancy filmmaking where you say  oh  you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood  and where you have big budgets. Here is that you make these films  it sells  you jump onto the location again to make another film  because if you don't make the next film  you're not going to feed. Bond Emeruwa  So while we're entertaining  we should be able to educate. I believe in the power of audiovisuals. I mean     percent of the population will watch Nollywood. I think it's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable. So if you're making a movie  no matter what your topic is  put in a message in there. Woman  You still have to report the incident. He needs proper medical attention. PP  I keep trying to explain to people  it's not about the quality at the moment    the quality is coming. I mean  there are those films that people are making for quality  but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day  and these are the people that really watch these films. Sonny McDon W  Nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world. Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa. Lancelot Imasen  But our films  they are stories that our people can relate to themselves. They are stories about our people  for our people. And consistently  they are glued to their screen whenever they see the story. Narrator  Suspense  fun and intrigue. It's the blockbuster comedy. You'll crack your ribs. Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi  We have been so deep into the foreign movies. It's all about the foreign movies. But we can do something too. We can do something  something that when the world sees it  they say  wow  this is Nigeria. Man  Just arrest yourself  sergeant. Don't embarrass yourself. Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back. SMW  You can now walk the street and see a role model. It s not just what you see in picture. You see the person live. You see how he talks. You see how he lives. He influences you really good  you know. It s not just what you see in the picture. It is not what you hear  you know  from the Western press. Man  See you. Bye. Action. Saint Obi  I was so fascinated  you know  with those cowboy movies. But then when I discovered the situation in my country  at that time there was so much corruption. For a young man to really make it out here  you got to think of some negative things and all that  or some kind of vices. And I didn't want that  you know. And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor  without doing crime  without cheating nobody  without telling no lies. Just me and God given talent. Man  Let's go. OK  it's time to kick some ass. Cover this. It's your own. Move it. Roboger Animadu  In big countries  when they do the movies  they have all these things in place. But here  we improvise these items  like the gunshots. Like they go  here  now  now  you see the gun there  but you won't see any guns shot  we use knock out. Kevin Books Ikeduba  What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face. Woman  That's why I use enough masking tape. The masking tape will hold it. Wat  wait. Just hold this for me. KBI  I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face    the explosion  you know. But she's a professional. She knows what she s doing. I'm trying to protect my face too. This ain't going to be my last movie. You know  this is Nollywood  where the magic lives. RA  So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here  with or without any assistance from anybody. Man  Action. Cut. Franco Sacchi  So many things to say  so little time. So many themes in this story. I just can't tell you    there s one thing I want to tell you. I spent  you know  several weeks with all these actors  producers  and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for  you know  a Westerner  a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe. But always with a smile  always with an enthusiasm  that is incredible. Werner Herzog  the German filmmaker said   I need to make movies like you need oxygen.  And I think they re breathing. The Nigerian filmmakers really  really  are doing what they like. And so it's a very  very important thing for them  and for their audiences. A woman told me   When I see a Nollywood film  I can relax  I really    I can breathe better.  There is also another very important thing that I hope will resonate with this audience. It s technology. I m very interested in it and I really think that the digital non linear editing has slashed  you know  the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be. Incredible cameras cost under       dollars. And this has unleashed tremendous energy. And guess what  We didn t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers. They understood it  they embraced the technology and they run with it  and they re successful. I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways. I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology  look at the Nigerian model  make their films  create jobs  create a narrative for the population  something to identify  something positive  something that really is psychological relief and it's part of the culture. But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us. I really think it goes both ways. Filmmakers  friends of mine  they look at Nollywood and they say   Wow  they are doing what we really want to do  and make a buck and live with this job.  So I really think it s a lesson that we're actually learning from them. And there's one thing  one small challenge that I have for you  and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling. And I think this is really the theme of this session. Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter  but no stories. No stories around the campfire. No legends  no fairytales. Nothing. No novels. Difficult  eh  It's meaningless. So this is what I really think. I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers  and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this. I would like you to hear their voices. Just a few moments. It s not an added sequence  just some voices from Nollywood. If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face  that s Nollywood. SO  I believe very soon  we re not only going to have better movies  we'll have that original Nigerian movie. BE  It s still the same basic themes. Love  action. But we're telling it our own way  our own Nigerian way  African way. We have diverse cultures  diverse cultures  there are so many  that in the natal lifetimes  I don't see us exhausting the stories we have. FS  My job ends here  and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work. And I really hope that there will be many  many collaborations  where we teach each other things. And I really hope that this will happen. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Stop. I've got two questions. Franco  you described this as the world's third largest film industry. What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films  really  FS  Oh  yes. I think I mentioned briefly    it's close to       films. There is scientific data on this. CA        films a year  FS        films a year.      or    the censor board has censored       films alone. And we know that there are more. So it s safe to say that there are       films. So imagine    films per week. There are challenges. There are challenges. There is a glut of film  the quality has to be raised  they need to go to the next level  but I m optimistic. CA  And these aren t films that are primarily seen in cinemas  FS  Oh yes  of course. This is very important. Maybe  you know  for you to try to imagine this  these are films that are distributed directly in markets. They are bought in video shops. They can be rented for pennies. CA  On what format  FS  Oh  the format    thank you for the question. Yes  it's VCDs. It's a CD  it's a little bit more compressed image. They started with VHS. They actually didn't wait for  you know  the latest technology. They started in '    '  . So there are    million VCRs in Nigeria that play  you know  VHS and these VCDs. It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc. CA  So on the streets  are film casts ...   FS  You can be in a Lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes. And I have to say  this really proves that storytelling  it's a commodity  it's a staple. There is no life without stories. CA  Franco  thank you so much. I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit  and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature. And so  I have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation  that is  looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning  and then following it up and trying to understand it. And so one of the questions that I asked you is  when you look around  what do you see  Well  you see this space that's created by designers and by the work of people  but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here  being reshaped in a certain form. And so the question is  how did that material get here  How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped  and so forth  It's a question of what's the continuity  So one of the things I look at is  how did the universe begin and shape  What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials  So that's sort of the part  and let me move on then and show you the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. If you look at this picture  what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it. And everything but    four of these light objects are stars  and you can see them there    little pluses. This is a star  this is a star  everything else is a galaxy  OK  So there's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here. And when I look out at particularly this galaxy  which looks a lot like ours  I wonder if there's an art design college conference going on  and intelligent beings there are thinking about  you know  what designs they might do  and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from  and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what's going on over here. But there's a lot of other galaxies  and some are nearby  and they're kind of the color of the Sun  and some are further away and they're a little bluer  and so forth. But one of the questions is    this should be  to you    how come there are so many galaxies  Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky. This is only       galaxies. We think there's on the order    visible to the Hubble Space Telescope  if you had the time to scan it around    about     billion galaxies. Right  It's a very large number of galaxies. And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy. But when you look at some of these regions like this  you'll see more galaxies than stars  which is kind of a conundrum. So the question should come to your mind is  what kind of design  you know  what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that  And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated. We're going to try and follow it up. We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study  and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine  in a certain sense. We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it. Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres  just because that's where we're making observations. And the moon is only two seconds away  so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light  it's the moon two seconds ago  and who cares. Two seconds is like the present. The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal  right  unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way. You'd like to have a little advance warning. But you get out to Jupiter and it's    minutes away. It's a problem. You hear about Mars  it's a problem communicating to Mars because it takes light long enough to go there. But if you look out to the nearest set of stars  to the nearest    or    stars  it's about    years. So if you take a picture of what's going on  it's    years ago. But you go and look to the center of the galaxy  it's thousands of years ago. If you look at Andromeda  which is the nearest big galaxy  and it's two million years ago. If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago  there'd be no evidence of humans at all  because we don't think there were humans yet. I mean  it just gives you the scale. With the Hubble Space Telescope  we're looking at hundreds of millions of years to a billion years. But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further    there's some things even further  and that was what I did in a lot of my work  was to develop the techniques    we could look out back to even earlier epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies  back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different. And so that's the sort of sequence  and so I have a more artistic impression of this. There's the galaxy in the middle  which is the Milky Way  and around that are the Hubble    you know  nearby kind of galaxies  and there's a sphere that marks the different times. And behind that are some more modern galaxies. You see the whole big picture  The beginning of time is funny    it's on the outside  right  And then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot  light can't escape. It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun  you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun. But you can see the edge of the Sun  and the universe gets that way  and you can see that. And then you see this sort of model area around the outside  and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang  which is actually incredibly uniform. The universe is almost a perfect sphere  but there are these very tiny variations which we show here in great exaggeration. And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies  and eventually the solar system  and so forth. So it's a big design job  but we'll see about how things are going on. So the way these measurements were done  there's been a set of satellites  and this is where you get to see. So there was the COBE satellite  which was launched in       and we discovered these variations. And then in       the MAP satellite was launched    the WMAP    and it made somewhat better pictures. And later this year    this is the cool stealth version  the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it  and you should look    the Planck satellite will be launched  and it will make very high resolution maps. And that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe. And what we saw was  we saw these variations  and then they told us the secrets  both about the structure of space time  and about the contents of the universe  and about how the universe started in its original motions. So we have this picture  which is quite a spectacular picture  and I'll come back to the beginning  where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning. And we go through a period of accelerating expansion  and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent  then to the Dark Ages  and then the first stars turn on  and they evolve into galaxies  and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies. And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming. And it's maturing up to the present time. And there's some spectacular things. And this wastebasket part  that's to represent what the structure of space time itself is doing during this period. And so this is a pretty weird model  right  What kind of evidence do we have for that  So let me show you some of nature's patterns that are the result of this. I always think of space time as being the real substance of space  and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean. It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on. So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies. So there's a dot on here for every galaxy. They go out and point a telescope at the sky  take a picture  identify what are stars and throw them away  look at the galaxies  estimate how far away they are  and plot them up. And just put radially they're going out that way. And you see these structures  this thing we call the Great Wall  but there are voids and those kinds of stuff  and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it. Now I'm going to show you this in  D. What happens is  you take pictures as the Earth rotates  you get a fan across the sky. There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy  or because there are no telescopes available to do it. So the next picture shows you the three dimensional version of this rotating around. Do you see the fan like scans made across the sky  Remember  every spot on here is a galaxy  and you see the galaxies  you know  sort of in our neighborhood  and you sort of see the structure. And you see this thing we call the Great Wall  and you see the complicated structure  and you see these voids. There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together  right. So there's an interesting pattern  but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern. We only have a million galaxies  right  So we're keeping  like  a million balls in the air but  what's going on  There's another survey which is very similar to this  called the Two degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey. Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million. And every time there's a galaxy    at its location there's a galaxy    and if we know anything about the galaxy  which we do  because there's a redshift measurement and everything  you put in the type of galaxy and the color  so this is the real representation. And when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern  it's like being in the middle of life. It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience  it's hard to see the pattern of this. So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this. And you'll see  first  the structure of the survey  and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there. So again  you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here. But you can see the voids  you can see the complicated structure  and you say  well  how did this happen  Suppose you're the cosmic designer. How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that  It's not just throwing them out at random. There's a more complicated process going on here. How are you going to end up doing that  And so now we're in for some serious play. That is  we have to seriously play God  not just change people's lives  but make the universe  right. So if that's your responsibility  how are you going to do that  What's the kind of technique  What's the kind of thing you're going to do  So I'm going to show you the results of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like  using  essentially  some of the play principles and some of the design principles that  you know  humans have labored so hard to pick up  but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning. And that is  you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules  but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated. And then you put in some randomness  some fluctuations and some randomness  and realize a whole bunch of different representations. So what I'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales. We're going to zoom in  but this is a plot of what it is. And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right. It's called dark matter. That is matter that doesn't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does  the way the light's shining on me or on the stage. It's transparent to light  but in order for you to see it  we're going to make it white. OK  So the stuff that's in this picture that's white  that is the dark matter. It should be called invisible matter  but the dark matter we've made visible. And the stuff that is in the yellow color  that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies. So I'll show you the next movie. So this    we're going to zoom in. Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern. We're going to zoom in and zoom in. And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids. And when a number of filaments come together in a knot  that makes a supercluster of galaxies. This one we're zooming in on is somewhere between         and a million galaxies in that small region. So we live in the boonies. We don't live in the center of the solar system  we don't live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster. So we're zooming in. This is a region which probably has more than          on the order of a million galaxies in that region. We're going to keep zooming in. OK. And so I forgot to tell you the scale. A parsec is  .   light years. So a gigaparsec is three billion light years    that's the scale. So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance. Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here. That's the distance between us and Andromeda  right  These little specks that you're seeing in here  they're galaxies. Now we're going to zoom back out  and you can see this structure that  when we get very far out  looks very regular  but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations. So they're simple building blocks. There's a very simple fluid to begin with. It's got dark matter  it's got ordinary matter  it's got photons and it's got neutrinos  which don't play much role in the later part of the universe. And it's just a simple fluid and it  over time  develops into this complicated structure. And so you know when you first saw this picture  it didn't mean quite so much to you. Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies  right  and nodes  but you realize they're not even the main structure. There's a framework  which is the dark matter  the invisible matter  that's out there that's actually holding it all together. So let's fly through it  and you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this out. So here's that same end result. You see a filament  you see the light is the invisible matter  and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up. And we're going to fly around  and we'll fly around  and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect  and you get a large cluster of galaxies. And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is  and you can see what it looks like. And so from inside  it doesn't look very complicated  right  It's only when you look at it at a very large scale  and explore it and so forth  you realize it's a very intricate  complicated kind of a design  right  And it's grown up in some kind of way. So the question is  how hard would it be to assemble this  right  How big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together  right  That's the issue  right  And so here we are. You see how the filament    you see how several filaments are coming together  therefore making this supercluster of galaxies. And you have to understand  this is not how it would actually look if you    first  you can't travel this fast  everything would be distorted  but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff. This is how  if you took billions of years to go around  it might look to you  right  And if you could see invisible matter  too. And so the idea is  you know  how would you put together the universe in a very simple way  We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe  everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus our other instruments  was once in a region that was smaller than an atom. It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations  but expanding at a tremendous rate. And those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes  and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background. And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on. So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation. This simulation was run on       processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one. So I'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture. So you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point  now four times smaller  and so forth. And you start seeing these networks  this cosmic web of structure forming. And this is a simple one  because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it. And you see how the dark matter lumps up  and the ordinary matter just trails along behind. So there it is. At the beginning it's very uniform. The fluctuations are a part in        . There are a few peaks that are a part in         and then over billions of years  gravity just pulls in. This is light over density  pulls the material around in. That pulls in more material and pulls in more material. But the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form. And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now  in terms of its expansion. And at that point  the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger scale structure. So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see  and then only things that have started forming already are going to form  and then from then on it's going to go on. So we're able to do the simulation  but this is two days on a desktop. We need  you know     days on       processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before. So we have an idea of how to play seriously  creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material  and we create everything we can see in any direction  right  from almost nothing    that is  something extremely tiny  extremely small    and it is almost perfect  except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in         level  which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see  that is  galaxies and stars and so forth. So we have a model  and we can calculate it  and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like. And that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was. So this is what we started with    years ago  with the Cosmic Background Explorer    made the map on the upper right  which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations  and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that. Since then we've had WMAP  which just gives us higher angular resolution. We see the same large scale structure  but we see additional small scale structure. And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the Earth  what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth. You can see  well  you can  kind of pick out all the major continents  but that's about it. But what we're hoping when we get to Planck  we'll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there  where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth. And you can also tell  because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together  there are some non linear processes. Geology has these effects  which is moving the plates around and so forth. You can see that just from the map alone. We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non linear effects that are starting to move  to modify  and are giving us a hint about how space time itself was actually created at the beginning moments. So that's where we are today  and that's what I wanted to give you  a flavor of. Give you a different view about what the design and what everything else looks like. Thank you. What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty  And what I found was quite surprising. We started looking at things like death rates in the   th century  and how they'd been improved  and very simple things turned out. You'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water  but it's actually the opposite. And so very simple things    off the shelf technologies that we could easily find on the then early Web    would clearly make a huge difference to that problem. But I also  in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies  became very concerned about the potential for abuse. If you think about it  in history  a long  long time ago we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual. We came up with something    the Ten Commandments  Thou shalt not kill. That's a  kind of a one on one thing. We organized into cities. We had many people. And to keep the many from tyrannizing the one  we came up with concepts like individual liberty. And then  to have to deal with large groups  say  at the nation state level  and we had to have mutual non aggression  or through a series of conflicts  we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace. But now we have a new situation  really what people call an asymmetric situation  where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond a nation state. It's not the nation states that have potential access to mass destruction  but individuals. And this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital. We saw genome sequences. You can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the Internet if you want to  and clearly someone recently    I saw in a science magazine    they said  well  the      flu is too dangerous to FedEx around. If people want to use it in their labs for working on research  just reconstruct it yourself  because  you know  it might break in FedEx. So that this is possible to do this is not deniable. So individuals in small groups super empowered by access to these kinds of self replicating technologies  whether it be biological or other  are clearly a danger in our world. And the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic. And we really don't have experience with pandemics  and we're also not very good as a society at acting to things we don't have direct and sort of gut level experience with. So it's not in our nature to pre act. And in this case  piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem  because it only super empowers people more. So the solution has to be  as people like Russell and Einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form  I think  early in the   th century  that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart. You know  public policy and moral progress. The bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power. We get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal. And so to limit the danger of these new things  we have to limit  ultimately  the ability of individuals to have access  essentially  to pandemic power. We also have to have sensible defense  because no limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something. And you know  and the troubling thing is that it's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things  so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage. So these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in      and       and my friends told me I was getting really depressed  and they were really worried about me. And then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in New York with one room full of books on the Plague  and you know  nuclear bombs exploding in New York where I would be within the circle  and so on. And then I was there on September   th  and I stood in the streets with everyone. And it was quite an experience to be there. I got up the next morning and walked out of the city  and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away. And I walked down the middle  up to the train station  and everything below   th Street was closed. It was quite a compelling experience  but not really  I suppose  a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books. It was always a surprise that it happened then and there  but it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all. And everyone then started writing about this. Thousands of people started writing about this. And I eventually abandoned the book  and then Chris called me to talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymore because  you know  there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on. But I agreed to come and say a few things about this. And I would say that we can't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat  which is what we seem to be doing because of the present  the people that are in power  because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization. And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing  because a million dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage  causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably  probably almost certainly  has made the problem worse. So we can't fight the thing with a million to one cost  one to a million cost benefit ratio. So after giving up on the book    and I had the great honor to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago  and to work through venture capital on the innovative side  and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as some of these big problems. Things where  you know  a factor of    difference can make a factor of       difference in the outcome. I've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk. It's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia so I can understand at least a little of what people are talking about who come through the doors. But I wanted to share with you three areas that I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that I was talking about in the Wired article. The first is this whole area of education  and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a      computer. And that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's Law. The most advanced transistors today are at    nanometers  and we've seen  and I've had the pleasure to invest in  companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Law all the way down to roughly the    nanometer scale. Another factor of  say  six in dimensional reduction  which should give us about another factor of     in raw improvement in what the chips can do. And so  to put that in practical terms  if something costs about       dollars today  say  the best personal computer you can buy  that might be its cost  I think we can have that in      for    dollars. Okay  Now  just imagine what that      computer will be in      as a tool for education. I think the challenge for us is    I'm very certain that that will happen  the challenge is  will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device  I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers  but we don't have very good software for them. And it's only in retrospect  after the better software comes along  and you take it and you run it on a ten year old machine  you say  God  the machine was that fast  I remember when they took the Apple Mac interface and they put it back on the Apple II. The Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface  we just didn't know how to do it at the time. So given that we know and should believe    because Moore's Law's been  like  a constant  I mean  it's just been very predictable progress over the last    years or whatever. We can know what the computers are going to be like in     . It's great that we have initiatives to say  let's go create the education and educate people in the world  because that's a great force for peace. And we can give everyone in the world a      computer or a     computer in the next    years. The second area that I'm focusing on is the environmental problem  because that's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world. We'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly. The thing that we see as the kind of Moore's Law trend that's driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is new materials. We have a challenge  because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time. People are moving to the cities. They all need clean water  they need energy  they need transportation  and we want them to develop in a green way. We're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors. We've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency  but the consumer sector  especially in America  is very inefficient. But these new materials bring such incredible innovations that there's a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market. And I want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered    years ago. If we take carbon nanotubes  you know  Iijima discovered them in       they just have incredible properties. And these are the kinds of things we're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale. Their strength  they're almost the strongest material  tensile strength material known. They're very  very stiff. They stretch very  very little. In two dimensions  if you make  like  a fabric out of them  they're    times stronger than Kevlar. And if you make a three dimensional structure  like a buckyball  they have all sorts of incredible properties. If you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them  they repair themselves  they go zip and they repair the hole in femtoseconds  which is not    is really quick. If you shine a light on them  they produce electricity. In fact  if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire. If you put electricity on them  they emit light. If you run current through them  you can run       times more current through one of these than through a piece of metal. You can make both p  and n type semiconductors  which means you can make transistors out of them. They conduct heat along their length but not across    well  there is no width  but not in the other direction if you stack them up  that's a property of carbon fiber also. If you put particles in them  and they go shooting out the tip    they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns. The inside of the nanotubes is so small    the smallest ones are  .  nanometers    that it's basically a quantum world. It's a strange place inside a nanotube. And so we begin to see  and we've seen business plans already  where the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there. I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about Witten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial. So inside of a nanotube  we're really at the limit here. So what we see is with these and other new materials that we can do things with different properties    lighter  stronger    and apply these new materials to the environmental problems. New materials that can make water  new materials that can make fuel cells work better  new materials that catalyze chemical reactions  that cut pollution and so on. Ethanol    new ways of making ethanol. New ways of making electric transportation. The whole green dream    because it can be profitable. And we've dedicated    we've just raised a new fund  we dedicated     million dollars to these kinds of investments. We believe that Genentech  the Compaq  the Lotus  the Sun  the Netscape  the Amazon  the Google in these fields are yet to be found  because this materials revolution will drive these things forward. The third area that we're working on  and we just announced last week    we were all in New York. We raised     million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense. And to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised was a      million fund  so this for us is a very substantial fund. And what we did  over the last few months    well  a few months ago  Ray Kurzweil and I wrote an op ed in the New York Times about how publishing the      genome was very dangerous. And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned   unclear   and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps. And so we asked ourselves  you know  can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps  And Brooks told me in a break here  he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep  because there's so many great technologies out there  we're essentially buried. And we need them  you know. We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works  roughly. That's Tamiflu. But Tamiflu    the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu. We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance    we need several anti virals. We need better surveillance. We need networks that can find out what's going on. We need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently. We've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly. We need new anti virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines. Vaccines that are broad spectrum. Vaccines that we can manufacture quickly. Cocktails  more polyvalent vaccines. You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains. We need    we don't know where this thing is going. We believe that if we could fill these    gaps  we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic. And the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of       in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact. So we're very excited because we think we can fund     or speed up    projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this. So if we can address  use technology  help address education  help address the environment  help address the pandemic  does that solve the larger problem that I was talking about in the Wired article  And I'm afraid the answer is really no  because you can't solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology. If we let an unlimited amount of power loose  then we will    a very small number of people will be able to abuse it. We can't fight at a million to one disadvantage. So what we need to do is  we need better policy. And for example  some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be    use markets. Markets are a very strong force. For example  rather than trying to regulate away problems  which probably won't work  if we could price into the cost of doing business  the cost of catastrophe  so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk. So if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on. But it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators  you'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe. And if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly  you can use a more powerful force  a market force  to provide feedback. How could you keep the law  I think the law would be a really good thing to keep. Well  you have to hold people accountable. The law requires accountability. Today scientists  technologists  businessmen  engineers don't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions. So if you tie that    you have to tie that back with the law. And finally  I think we have to do something that's not really    it's almost unacceptable to say this    which  we have to begin to design the future. We can't pick the future  but we can steer the future. Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes. We may not be able to stop it  but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem. So we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen  and steer us to a lower risk place. Vice President Gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower probability of catastrophic risk. But above all  what we have to do is we have to help the good guys  the people on the defensive side  have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things. And what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information. And growing up as we have  and holding very high the value of free speech  this is a hard thing for us to accept    for all of us to accept. It's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember  you know  Galileo essentially locked up  and who are still fighting this battle against the church. But that's the price of having a civilization. The price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power. Thank you. I went to Spain a few months ago and I had the best foie gras of my life. The best culinary experience of my life. Because what I saw  I'm convinced  is the future of cooking. Ridiculous  right  Foie gras and the future of cooking. There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras  right  I mean  it's crucified. It was outlawed in Chicago for a while. It's pending here in California  and just recently in New York. It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu  you risk being attacked. Really  it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef. I'm not saying that there's not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras. The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage  which is the force feeding. Basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat. More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime. Its liver expands by eight times. Suffice to say it's like    it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming. The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious. I mean  I love the stuff. It is fatty  it's sweet  it's silky  it's unctuous. It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible. Can we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras  Yes  sure. You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids  right  Not a lot of people are doing it. And for good reason. So several months ago  a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy  Eduardo Sousa. Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras. Natural foie gras. What's natural about foie gras  To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall  geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter. And the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land and eat what they want. So no gavage  no force feeding  no factory like conditions  no cruelty. And it's shockingly not a new idea. His great granddad started    Pater a de Sousa    in     . And they've been doing it quietly ever since. That is until last year  when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur  the coveted French gastronomic prize. It's like the Olympics of food products. He placed first for his foie gras. Big  big problem. As he said to me  that really pissed the French off. He said it sort of gleefully. It was all over the papers. I read about it. It was in Le Monde.  Spanish chef accused ...      and the French accused him.  Spanish chef accused of cheating.  They accused him of paying off the judges. They implicated actually  the Spanish government  amazingly. Huh  amazing. A huge scandal for a few weeks. Couldn't find a shred of evidence. Now  look at the guy. He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges for his foie gras. So that died down  and very soon afterward  new controversy. He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras. It's not foie gras because it's not gavage. There's no force feeding. So by definition  he's lying and should be disqualified. As funny as it sounds  articulating it now and reading about it    actually  if we had talked about it before this controversy  I would have said   That's kind of true.  You know  foie gras by definition  force feeding  it's gavage  and that's what you get when you want foie gras. That is  until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura     miles north of Seville  right on the Portugal border. I saw first hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time  like everything beautiful in nature  is utterly simple. And he said to me  really from the first moment  my life's work is to give the geese what they want. He repeated that about    times in the two days I was with him. I'm just here to give the geese what they want. Actually  when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone taking pictures of them like his children in the grass. Amazing. He's really just in love with    he's at one with    he's the goose whisperer. And when I was speaking to him  you know  I thought  like I'm speaking to you now  right  but sort of in the middle of my questions  my excited questions  because the more I got to know him and his system  the more exciting this whole idea became. He kept going like this to me. And I thought  OK  excited Jew from New York  right  I'm talking a little too aggressively  whatever  so you know  I slowed down. And finally  by the end of the day I was like  Ed uar do  you know like this  But he was still going like this. I figured it out. I was speaking too loudly. So I hushed my voice. I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper. And he stopped doing this. And amazingly  the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around     Get the hell away from this kid      when I lowered my voice  they all came right up to us. Right up to us  like right up to here. Right along the fence line. And fence line was amazing in itself. The fence    like this conception of fence that we have it's totally backward with him. The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside. He rewired it. He invented it. I've never seen it. Have you  You fence in animals. You electrify the inside. He doesn't. He electrifies only the outside. Why  Because he said to me that he felt like the geese    and he proved this actually  not just a conceit  he proved this    the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks. Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden with figs and everything else. He felt like they felt manipulated. So he got rid of the electricity  he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside  so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators. Now  what happened  They ate  and he showed me on a chart  how they ate about    percent more feed to feed their livers. The landscape is incredible. I mean  his farm is incredible. It really is the Garden of Eden. There's figs and everything else there for the taking. And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura  the area    what does Extremadura mean  Extra hard land  right  Extra difficult. Extra hard. But over four generations  he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu. Upgrades the life for these geese. And they are allowed to take whatever they want. Another irony  the double irony is that on the figs and the olives  Eduardo can make more money selling those than he can on the foie gras. He doesn't care. He lets them take what they want and he says   Usually  it's about    percent. They're very fair.  The other    percent  he takes and he sells and he makes money on them. Part of the income for his farm. A big part of his income for his farm. But he never controls it. They get what they want  they leave the rest for me and I sell it. His biggest obstacle  really  was the marketplace  which demands these days bright yellow foie gras. That's how I've been trained. You want to look and see what good foie gras is  it's got to be bright yellow. It's the indication that it's the best foie gras. Well  because he doesn't force feed  because he doesn't gavage tons of corn  his livers were pretty grey. Or they were. But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush. The Lupin bush  it's all around Extremadura. He let it go to seed  he took the seeds  he planted it on his    acres  all around. And the geese love the Lupin bush. Not for the bush  but for the seeds. And when they eat the seeds  their foie gras turns yellow. Radioactive yellow. Bright yellow. Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen. So I'm listening to all this  you know  and I'm like  is this guy for real  Is he making some of this up  Is he like  you know    because he seemed to have an answer for everything  and it was always nature. It was never him. And I was like  you know  I always get a little  like  weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves. Because  really  they want you to look at themselves  right  But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape. So it's like  here I am  I'm on the fence about this guy  but increasingly  eating up his every word. And we're sitting there  and I hear  clapping  from a distance  so I look over. And he grabs my arm and the translator's  and ducks us under a bush and says   Watch this.   Shush   he says again for the    th time to me.  Shush  watch this.  And this squadron of geese come over.  Clapping  And they're getting louder  louder  louder  like really loud  right over us. And like airport traffic control  as they start to go past us they're called back    and they're called back and back and back. And then they circle around. And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.  Clapping  And the wild geese are calling down.  Clapping  And it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land. And I'm just saying   No way.  No way. And I look at Eduardo  who's near tears looking at this  and I say   You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit   And he says   No  no  no. They've come to stay.  They've come to stay  It's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter  right  I said that. I said  Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for  To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm   He said   No  no  no. Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life. To happiness. They find it here. They don't need anything more.  They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese  and his flock continues. Think about that for a minute. It's brilliant  right  Imagine    I don't know  imagine a hog farm in  like  North Carolina  and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay. So how did it taste  I finally got to taste it before I left. He took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his foie gras  confit de foie gras. It was incredible. And the problem with saying that  of course  is that you know  at this point it risks hyperbole really easily. And I'd like to make a metaphor  but I don't have one really. I was drinking this guy's Kool Aid so much  he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like  this guy's a genius  you know  I'm really in love with him at this point. But it truly was the best foie gras of my life. So much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment. I'd had something that was called foie gras. But this was transformative. Really transformative. And I say to you  I might not stick to this  but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with Eduardo. It was sweet  it was unctuous. It had all the qualities of foie gras  but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty. And you could taste herbs  you could taste spices. And I kept    I said  you know  I swear to God I tasted star anise. I was sure of it. And I'm not like some super taster  you know  But I can taste things. There's     percent star anise in there. And he says   No.  And I ended up like going down the spices  and finally  it was like  OK  salt and pepper  thinking he's salted and peppered his liver. But no. He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras  he sticks them in this jar and he confits it. No salt  no pepper  no oil  no spices. What  We went back out for the final tour of the farm  and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity. He doesn't need salt and pepper. And he doesn't need spices  because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors that his geese love to gorge on. I turned to him at the end of the meal  and it's a question I asked several times  and he hadn't  kind of  answered me directly  but I said   Now look  you're in Spain  some of the greatest chefs in the world are    Ferran Adria  the preeminent chef of the world today  not that far from you. How come you don't give him this  How come no one's really heard of you   And it may be because of the wine  or it may be because of my excitement  he answered me directly and he said   Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras.  And he was right. He was right. Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own. They create a dish where all the vectors point at us. With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature. And as he said  I think fittingly  it's a gift from God  with God saying  you've done good work. Simple. I flew home  I'm on the flight with my little black book and I took  you know  pages and pages of notes about it. I really was moved. And in the corner of one of these    one of my notes  is this note that says  when asked  what do you think of conventional foie gras  What do you think of foie gras that   .      percent of the world eats  He said   I think it's an insult to history.  And I wrote  insult to history. I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out. It's like  why didn't I follow up on that  What the hell does that mean  Insult to history. So I did some research when I got back  and here's what I found. The history of foie gras. Jews invented foie gras. True story. True story. By accident. They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz. Gotten sick of the chicken fat. They were looking for an alternative. And they saw in the fall that there was this natural  beautiful  sweet  delicious fat from geese. And they slaughtered them  used the fat throughout the winter for cooking. The Pharaoh got wind of this    This is true  right off the Internet. The Pharaoh got     Laughter  I swear to God. The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it. He tasted it and fell in love with it. He started demanding it. And he didn't want it just in the fall  he wanted it all year round. And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone. And the Jews  fearing for their life  had to come up with an ingenious idea  or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes  of course. And they invented  what  Gavage. They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives  and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver  and the good stuff they kept for themselves. Supposedly  anyway. I believe that one. That's the history of foie gras. And if you think about it  it's the history of industrial agriculture. It's the history of what we eat today. Most of what we eat today. Mega farms  feed lots  chemical amendments  long distance travel  food processing. All of it  our food system. That's also an insult to history. It's an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology. Whether we're talking about beef cattle or we're talking about chickens  or we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts  or in the case of this morning's New York Times  catfish    which wholesale are going out of business. Whatever it is  it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors. It's rooted in extraction. Take more  sell more  waste more. And for the future it won't serve us. Jonas Salk has a great quote. He said   If all the insects disappeared  life on Earth as we know it would disappear within    years. If human beings disappeared  life on Earth as we know it would flourish.  And he's right. We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture. Really new. One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation. And stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food. We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo. Farmers that rely on nature for solutions  for answers  rather than imposing solutions on nature. Listening as Janine Benyus  one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says   Listening to nature's operating instructions.  That's what Eduardo does  and does so brilliantly. And what he showed me and what he can show all of us  I think  is that the great thing for chefs  the great blessing for chefs  and for people that care about food and cooking  is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food. Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras. And it's also almost always  and I haven't found an example otherwise  but almost always  the most delicious choice. That's serendipitous. Thank you. Great creativity. In times of need  we need great creativity. Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly  absurdly  rationally  irrationally powerful. Great creativity can spread tolerance  champion freedom  make education seem like a bright idea. Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation  or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so. Great creativity can make politicians electable  or parties unelectable. It can make war seem like tragedy or farce. Creativity is the meme maker that puts slogans on our t shirts and phrases on our lips. It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze. Science is clever  but great creativity is something less knowable  more magical. And now we need that magic. This is a time of need. Our climate is changing quickly  too quickly. And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well  to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements. To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps. Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener. Narrator  And so he walked  and as he walked he saw things. Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen. A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle. A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall. And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her. The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart. Sure  she had aged a little. In fact  she had aged a lot. But he felt all his old passion for her return.  Ford   he called softly. For that was her name.  Don't say another word  Gusty   she said  for that was his name.  I know a tent next to a caravan  exactly     yards from here. Let's go there and make love. In the tent.  Ford undressed. She spread one leg  and then the other. Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him  because she was a keen amateur pornographer. The earth moved for both of them. And they lived together happily ever after. And all because he decided to walk that day. Andy Hobsbawm  We've got the science  we've had the debate. The moral imperative is on the table. Great creativity is needed to take it all  make it simple and sharp. To make it connect. To make it make people want to act. So this is a call  a plea  to the incredibly talented TED community. Let's get creative against climate change. And let's do it soon. Thank you. Unless we do something to prevent it  over the next    years we re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale. A cheery thought. On this map  every country that s colored blue has more than    percent of its population over the age of   . This is the world we live in. And this is the world your children will live in. For        years  the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid  with the oldest on top. It s already flattening out. By       it s going to be a column and will start to invert. This is why it s happening. The average lifespan s more than doubled since       and it s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day. And this is why that s not entirely a good thing  because over the age of     your risk of getting Alzheimer s or Parkinson s disease will increase exponentially. By       there ll be about    million people in the United States over the age of     and unless we do something about it  half of them will have Alzheimer s disease and three million more will have Parkinson s disease. Right now  those and other neurologic diseases    for which we have no cure or prevention    cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year. It will be well over a trillion dollars by     . Alzheimer s disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami. So one approach we re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape  to hold the protein into its proper shape. That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do. Interestingly enough  other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein  which suggests that the approach might be a general one  and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases  not just Alzheimer s disease. There s also a fascinating connection to cancer here  because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers. And this is a connection that most people aren t pursuing right now  but which we re fascinated by. Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies. And there s tremendous scope for additional private help here  because the government has dropped the ball on much of this  I m afraid. In the meantime  while we re waiting for all these things to happen  here s what you can do for yourself. If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson s disease  caffeine is protective to some extent  nobody knows why. Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson s disease. And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea. As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer s disease  well  it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer s disease. You should also keep your blood pressure down  because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer s disease. It s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma  which is just Alzheimer s disease of the eye. And of course  when it comes to cognitive effects   use it or lose it  applies  so you want to stay mentally stimulated. But hey  you re listening to me. So you ve got that covered. And one final thing. Wish people like me luck  okay  Because the clock is ticking for all of us. Thank you.
