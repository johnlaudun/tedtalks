A girl I've never met before changed my life and the life of thousands of other people. I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org. It's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people. In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States. And we're not homophobic. And it's true    the way we communicate with young people is by text  because that's how young people communicate. So we'll run over     campaigns this year  things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries  or making Valentine's Day cards for senior citizens who are homebound. And we'll text them. And we'll have a    percent open rate. It'll over index Hispanic and urban. We collected         jars of peanut butter and over         Valentine's Day cards. This is big scale. OK    But there's one weird side effect. Every time we send out a text message  we get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter or hunger or senior citizens    but text messages about being bullied  text messages about being addicted to pot. And the worst message we ever got said exactly this   He won't stop raping me. It's my dad. He told me not to tell anyone. Are you there   We couldn't believe this was happening. We couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being  and that she would share it with us    something so intimate  so personal. And we realized we had to stop triaging this and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain. So we launched Crisis Text Line  very quietly  in Chicago and El Paso    just a few thousand people in each market. And in four months  we were in all     area codes in America. Just to put that into perspective  that's zero marketing and faster growth than when Facebook first launched. Text is unbelievably private. No one hears you talking. So we spike everyday at lunch time    kids are sitting at the lunch table and you think that she's texting the cute boy across the hall  but she's actually texting us about her bulimia. And we don't get the word  like  or  um  or hyperventilating or crying. We just get facts. We get things like   I want to die. I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me.  And so the crisis counselor says   How about you put those pills in the drawer while we text   And they go back and forth for a while. And the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address  because if you're texting a text line  you want help. So she gets the address and the counselor triggers an active rescue while they're texting back and forth. And then it goes quiet       minutes with no response from this girl. And the next message that comes in says    it's the mom     I had no idea  and I was in the house  we're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital.  As a mom that one just    The next message comes a month later.  I just got out of the hospital. I was diagnosed as bipolar  and I think I'm going to be OK.  I would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange  but we're doing on average  .   active rescues a day. Thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression    huge. The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line is that these are strangers counseling other strangers on the most intimate issues  and getting them from hot moments to cold moments. It's exciting  and I will tell you that we have done a total of more than  .  million text messages in less than two years. But the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this  the thing that really gets me psyched is the data   .  million messages    that's the volume  velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus. We can do things like predictive work. We can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set. So we can be better  and the world can be better. So how do we use the data to make us better  Alright  chances are someone here  someone watching this has seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life    you do not have to raise your hand. How do you know that person's any good  Oh  they have a degree from Harvard on the wall  Are you sure he didn't graduate in the bottom    percent  When my husband and I saw a marriage counselor  I thought she was a genius when she said   I'll see you guys in two weeks    but I need to see you next week  sir.  We have the data to know what makes a great counselor. We know that if you text the words  numbs  and  sleeve   there's a    percent match for cutting. We know that if you text in the words  mg  and  rubber band   there's a    percent match for substance abuse. And we know that if you text in  sex    oral  and  Mormon   you're questioning if you're gay. Now that's interesting information that a counselor could figure out but that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic pop up says      percent match for cutting    try asking one of these questions  to prompt the counselor. Or     percent match for substance abuse  here are three drug clinics near the texter.  It makes us more accurate. On the day that Robin Williams committed suicide  people flooded hotlines all over this country. It was sad to see an icon  a funnyman  commit suicide  and there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country. We had a spike in volume also. The difference was if you text us   I want to die   or  I want to kill myself   the algorithm reads that  you're code orange  and you become number one in the queue. So we can handle severity  not chronological. This data is also making the world better because I'm sitting on the world's first map of real time crises. Think about it  those  .  million messages  auto tagging through natural language processes  all of these data points    I can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders  Monday. The worst time of day for substance abuse   am. And that Montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there  because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation. And we've made this data public and free and open. We've pulled all the personally identifiable information. And it's in a place called CrisisTrends.org. Because I want schools to be able to see that Monday is the worst day for eating disorders  so that they can plan meals and guidance counselors to be there on Mondays. And I want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at  am. I want somebody to take care of those Native American reservations in Montana. Data  evidence makes policy  research  journalism  policing  school boards    everything better. I don't think of myself as a mental health activist. I think of myself as a national health activist. I get really excited about this data  I'm a little nerdy. Yeah  that sounded too girly. I'm nerdy. I love data. And the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road with their fat funded companies  is that I'm not inspired by helping you find Chinese food at  am in Dallas  or helping you touch your wrist and get a car immediately  or swipe right and get laid. I'm inspired    I want to use tech and data to make the world a better place. I want to use it to help that girl  who texted in about  being raped by her father. Because the truth is we never heard from her again. And I hope that she is somewhere safe and healthy  and I hope that she sees this talk and she knows that her desperation and her courage inspired the creation of Crisis Text Line and inspires me every freaking day. Every day  I listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives  across dangerous borders and unfriendly seas. But there's one story that keeps me awake at night  and it's about Doaa. A Syrian refugee     years old  she was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages. Her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria that had been blown to pieces by a bomb. And the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year. And the community that once welcomed them there had become weary of them. And one day  men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her. Once an aspiring student thinking only of her future  now she was scared all the time. But she was also full of hope  because she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem. Bassem was also struggling in Egypt  and he said to Doaa   Let's go to Europe  seek asylum  safety. I will work  you can study    the promise of a new life.  And he asked her father for her hand in marriage. But they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives  traveling across the Mediterranean Sea  putting their hands in smugglers'  notorious for their cruelty. And Doaa was terrified of the water. She always had been. She never learned to swim. It was August that year  and already       people had died trying to cross the Mediterranean  but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe  and she thought   Maybe we can  too.  So she asked her parents if they could go  and after a painful discussion  they consented  and Bassem paid his entire life savings          dollars each    to the smugglers. It was a Saturday morning when the call came  and they were taken by bus to a beach  hundreds of people on the beach. They were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat      of them crammed onto that boat      below        above. There were Syrians  Palestinians  Africans  Muslims and Christians      children  including Sandra    little Sandra  six years old    and Masa     months. There were families on that boat  crammed together shoulder to shoulder  feet to feet. Doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest  Bassem holding her hand. Day two on the water  they were sick with worry and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea. Day three  Doaa had a premonition. And she said to Bassem   I fear we're not going to make it. I fear the boat is going to sink.  And Bassem said to her   Please be patient. We will make it to Sweden  we will get married and we will have a future.  Day four  the passengers were getting agitated. They asked the captain   When will we get there   He told them to shut up  and he insulted them. He said   In    hours we will reach the shores of Italy.  They were weak and weary. Soon they saw a boat approach    a smaller boat     men on board  who started shouting at them  hurling insults  throwing sticks  asking them to all disembark and get on this smaller  more unseaworthy boat. The parents were terrified for their children  and they collectively refused to disembark. So the boat sped away in anger  and a half an hour later  came back and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat  just below where she and Bassem were sitting. And she heard how they yelled   Let the fish eat your flesh   And they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank. The     people below deck were doomed. Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank  and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller. Bassem said to her   Please let go  or you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you  too.  And remember    she can't swim. But she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs  thinking   This is swimming.  And miraculously  Bassem found a life ring. It was one of those child's rings that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas. And Doaa climbed onto the ring  her arms and her legs dangling by the side. Bassem was a good swimmer  so he held her hand and tread water. Around them there were corpses. Around     people survived initially  and they started coming together in groups  praying for rescue. But when a day went by and no one came  some people gave up hope  and Doaa and Bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water. One man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder  nine months old    Malek. He was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat  and he said to them   I fear I am not going to survive. I'm too weak. I don't have the courage anymore.  And he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa  and they perched her onto the life ring. So now they were three  Doaa  Bassem and little Malek. And let me take a pause in this story right here and ask the question  why do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks  Millions of refugees are living in exile  in limbo. They're living in countries  fleeing  from a war that has been raging for four years. Even if they wanted to return  they can't. Their homes  their businesses  their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed. This is a UNESCO World Heritage City  Homs  in Syria. So people continue to flee into neighboring countries  and we build refugee camps for them in the desert. Hundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these  and thousands and thousands more  millions  live in towns and cities. And the communities  the neighboring countries that once welcomed them with open arms and hearts are overwhelmed. There are simply not enough schools  water systems  sanitation. Even rich European countries could never handle such an influx without massive investment. The Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders  but over seven million people are on the run inside the country. That means that over half the Syrian population has been forced to flee. Back to those neighboring countries hosting so many. They feel that the richer world has done too little to support them. And days have turned into months  months into years. A refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary. Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water. It was their second day  and Bassem was getting very weak. And now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem   My love  please hold on to hope  to our future. We will make it.  And he said to her   I'm sorry  my love  that I put you in this situation. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.  And he released himself into the water  and Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes. Later that day  a mother came up to Doaa with her small    month old daughter  Masa. This was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier  with the life vests. Her older sister Sandra had just drowned  and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power to save her daughter. And she said to Doaa   Please take this child. Let her be part of you. I will not survive.  And then she went away and drowned. So Doaa  the    year old refugee who was terrified of the water  who couldn't swim  found herself in charge of two little baby kids. And they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated  and she tried her best to amuse them  to sing to them  to say words to them from the Quran. Around them  the bodies were bloating and turning black. The sun was blazing during the day. At night  there was a cold moon and fog. It was very frightening. On the fourth day in the water  this is how Doaa probably looked on the ring with her two children. A woman came on the fourth day and approached her and asked her to take another child    a little boy  just four years old. When Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned  she said to the sobbing child   She just went away to find you water and food.  But his heart soon stopped  and Doaa had to release the little boy into the water. Later that day  she looked up into the sky with hope  because she saw two planes crossing in the sky. And she waved her arms  hoping they would see her  but the planes were soon gone. But that afternoon  as the sun was going down  she saw a boat  a merchant vessel. And she said   Please  God  let them rescue me.  She waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours. And it had become dark  but finally the searchlights found her and they extended a rope  astonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies. They pulled them onto the boat  they got oxygen and blankets  and a Greek helicopter came to pick them up and take them to the island of Crete. But Doaa looked down and asked   What of Malek   And they told her the little baby did not survive    she drew her last breath in the boat's clinic. But Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat  that little baby girl had been smiling. Only    people survived that wreck  of the    . There was never an international investigation into what happened. There were some media reports about mass murder at sea  a terrible tragedy  but that was only for one day. And then the news cycle moved on. Meanwhile  in a pediatric hospital on Crete  little Masa was on the edge of death. She was really dehydrated. Her kidneys were failing. Her glucose levels were dangerously low. The doctors did everything in their medical power to save them  and the Greek nurses never left her side  holding her  hugging her  singing her words. My colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic. Amazingly  little Masa survived. And soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby  who had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink  and offers to adopt her came from all over the country. And meanwhile  Doaa was in another hospital on Crete  thin  dehydrated. An Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released. And soon word went around about Doaa's survival  and a phone number was published on Facebook. Messages started coming in.  Doaa  do you know what happened to my brother  My sister  My parents  My friends  Do you know if they survived   One of those messages said   I believe you saved my little niece  Masa.  And it had this photo. This was from Masa's uncle  a Syrian refugee who had made it to Sweden with his family and also Masa's older sister. Soon  we hope  Masa will be reunited with him in Sweden  and until then  she's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in Athens. And Doaa  Well  word went around about her survival  too. And the media wrote about this slight woman  and couldn't imagine how she could survive all this time under such conditions in that sea  and still save another life. The Academy of Athens  one of Greece's most prestigious institutions  gave her an award of bravery  and she deserves all that praise  and she deserves a second chance. But she wants to still go to Sweden. She wants to reunite with her family there. She wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings away from Egypt there as well  and I believe she will succeed. She wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight injustice. She is an extraordinary survivor. But I have to ask  what if she didn't have to take that risk  Why did she have to go through all that  Why wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe  Why couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden  Why couldn't Bassem have found work  Why is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees  the victims of the worst war of our times  The world did this for the Vietnamese in the     s. Why not now  Why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees  And why  the root question  is so little being done to stop the wars  the persecution and the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of Europe  Until these issues are resolved  people will continue to take to the seas and to seek safety and asylum. And what happens next  Well  that is largely Europe's choice. And I understand the public fears. People are worried about their security  their economies  the changes of culture. But is that more important than saving human lives  Because there is something fundamental here that I think overrides the rest  and it is about our common humanity. No person fleeing war or persecution should have to die crossing a sea to reach safety. One thing is for sure  that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are. And no migrant would take that dangerous journey if they had enough food for themselves and their children. And no one would put their life savings in the hands of those notorious smugglers if there was a legal way to migrate. So on behalf of little Masa and on behalf of Doaa and of Bassem and of those     people who drowned with them  can we make sure that they did not die in vain  Could we be inspired by what happened  and take a stand for a world in which every life matters  Thank you. This is one of the most amazing animals on the face of the Earth. This is a tapir. Now this  this is a baby tapir  the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom. By far. There is no competition here. I have dedicated the past    years of my life to the research and conservation of tapirs in Brazil  and it has been absolutely amazing. But at the moment  I've been thinking really  really hard about the impact of my work. I've been questioning myself about the real contributions I have made for the conservation of these animals I love so much. Am I being effective in safeguarding their survival  Am I doing enough  I guess the big question here is  am I studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation  or am I just documenting their extinction  The world is facing so many different conservation crises. We all know that. It's all over the news every day. Tropical forests and other ecosystems are being destroyed  climate change  so many species on the brink of extinction  tigers  lions  elephants  rhinos  tapirs. This is the lowland tapir  the tapir species I work with  the largest terrestrial mammal of South America. They're massive. They're powerful. Adults can weigh up to     kilos. That's half the size of a horse. They're gorgeous. Tapirs are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon  and they absolutely need large patches of habitat in order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and survive. But their habitat is being destroyed  and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution. And you see  this is very  very unfortunate because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found. They're herbivores. Fifty percent of their diet consists of fruit  and when they eat the fruit  they swallow the seeds  which they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces. They play this major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest  and for that reason  tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest. Isn't that amazing  If you think about it  the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect biodiversity as a whole. I started my tapir work in       still very young  fresh out of college  and it was a pioneer research and conservation program. At that point  we had nearly zero information about tapirs  mostly because they're so difficult to study. They're nocturnal  solitary  very elusive animals  and we got started getting very basic data about these animals. But what is it that a conservationist does  Well  first  we need data. We need field research. We need those long term datasets to support conservation action  and I told you tapirs are very hard to study  so we have to rely on indirect methods to study them. We have to capture and anesthetize them so that we can install GPS collars around their necks and follow their movements  which is a technique used by many other conservationists around the world. And then we can gather information about how they use space  how they move through the landscape  what are their priority habitats  and so much more. Next  we must disseminate what we learn. We have to educate people about tapirs and how important these animals are. And it's amazing how many people around the world do not know what a tapir is. In fact  many people think this is a tapir. Let me tell you  this is not a tapir. This is a giant anteater. Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever. And then next we have to provide training  capacity building. It is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future. We are losing several conservation battles  and we need more people doing what we do  and they need the skills  and they need the passion to do that. Ultimately  we conservationists  we must be able to apply our data  to apply our accumulated knowledge to support actual conservation action. Our first tapir program took place in the Atlantic Forest in the eastern part of Brazil  one of the most threatened biomes in the world. The destruction of the Atlantic Forest began in the early     s  when the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil  beginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America. This forest was almost completely cleared for timber  agriculture  cattle ranching and the construction of cities  and today only seven percent of the Atlantic forest is still left standing. And tapirs are found in very  very small  isolated  disconnected populations. In the Atlantic Forest  we found out that tapirs move through open areas of pastureland and agriculture going from one patch of forest to patch of forest. So our main approach in this region was to use our tapir data to identify the potential places for the establishment of wildlife corridors in between those patches of forest  reconnecting the habitat so that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely. After    years in the Atlantic Forest  in       we expanded our tapir conservation efforts to the Pantanal in the western part of Brazil near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay. This is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world  an incredible place and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America. And working in the Pantanal has been extremely refreshing because we found large  healthy tapir populations in the area  and we have been able to study tapirs in the most natural conditions we'll ever find  very much free of threats. In the Pantanal  besides the GPS collars  we are using another technique  camera traps. This camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it. So thanks to these amazing devices  we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you're trying to develop those conservation strategies. And right now        we are expanding our work once again to the Brazilian Cerrado  the open grasslands and shrub forests in the central part of Brazil. Today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country  where natural habitat and wildlife populations are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats  including once again cattle ranching  large sugarcane and soybean plantations  poaching  roadkill  just to name a few. And somehow  tapirs are still there  which gives me a lot of hope. But I have to say that starting this new program in the Cerrado was a bit of a slap in the face. When you drive around and you find dead tapirs along the highways and signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations where they shouldn't be  and you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes because their families poach and eat them  it really breaks your heart. The situation in the Cerrado made me realize    it gave me the sense of urgency. I am swimming against the tide. It made me realize that despite two decades of hard work trying to save these animals  we still have so much work to do if we are to prevent them from disappearing. We have to find ways to solve all these problems. We really do  and you know what  We really came to a point in the conservation world where we have to think out of the box. We'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now. And I told you  roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the Cerrado  so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs. These are the same stickers used on big trucks to avoid collision. Tapirs cross the highways after dark  so the stickers will hopefully help drivers see this shining thing crossing the highway  and maybe they will slow down a little bit. For now  this is just a crazy idea. We don't know. We'll see if it will reduce the amount of tapir roadkill. But the point is  maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done. And although I'm struggling with all these questions in my mind right now  I have a pact with tapirs. I know in my heart that tapir conservation is my cause. This is my passion. I am not alone. I have this huge network of supporters behind me  and there is no way I'm ever going to stop. I will continue doing this  most probably for the rest of my life. And I'll keep doing this for Patr cia  my namesake  one of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the Atlantic Forest many  many years ago  for Rita and her baby Vincent in the Pantanal. And I'll keep doing this for Ted  a baby tapir we captured in December last year also in the Pantanal. And I will keep doing this for the hundreds of tapirs that I've had the pleasure to meet over the years and the many others I know I will encounter in the future. These animals deserve to be cared for. They need me. They need us. And you know  We human beings deserve to live in a world where we can get out there and see and benefit from not only tapirs but all the other beautiful species  now and in the future. Thank you so much. I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard off the shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver. There is no Wi Fi involved  it's just light. And you may wonder  what's the point  And the point is this  There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close the digital divide  and also to allow for what we call  The Internet of Things     tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet. In my view  such an extension of the Internet can only work if it's almost energy neutral. This means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible. And this is where the solar cell and the LED come in. I demonstrated for the first time  at TED in       Li Fi  or Light Fidelity. Li Fi uses off the shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast  and also in a safe and secure manner. Data is transported by the light  encoded in subtle changes of the brightness. If we look around  we have many LEDs around us  so there's a rich infrastructure of Li Fi transmitters around us. But so far  we have been using special devices    small photo detectors  to receive the information encoded in the data. I wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our Li Fi lights. And this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels. A solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy. This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone. But now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED  so if the incoming light fluctuates  so does the energy harvested from the solar cell. This means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information from the light and by the solar cell  because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted. Of course the question is  can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness  such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights  And the answer to that is yes  we can. We have shown in the lab that we can receive up to    megabytes per second from a standard  off the shelf solar cell. And this is faster than most broadband connections these days. Now let me show you in practice. In this box is a standard  off the shelf LED lamp. This is a standard  off the shelf solar cell  it is connected to the laptop. And also we have an instrument here to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell. And this instrument shows something at the moment. This is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light. Now what I would like to do first is switch on the light  and I'll simply  only switch on the light  for a moment  and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right. So the solar cell  for a moment  is harvesting energy from this artificial light source. If I turn it off  we see it drops. I turn it on ... So we harvest energy with the solar cell. But next I would like to activate the streaming of the video. And I've done this by pressing this button. So now this LED lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way  and in a way that you can't recognize with your eye  because the changes are too fast to recognize. But in order to prove the point  I can block the light of the solar cell. So first you notice the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well. If I remove the blockage  the video will restart. And I can repeat that. So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well. So that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver. But now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light  and there's fog. And so I want to simulate fog  and that's why I brought a handkerchief with me. And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell. First you notice the energy harvested drops  as expected  but now the video still continues. This means  despite the blockage  there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell  so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information  in this case  a high definition video. What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver for high speed wireless signals encoded in light  while it maintains its primary function as an energy harvesting device. That's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill  or indeed  lamp post. And It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell. And the same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows  solar cells integrated into street furniture  or indeed  solar cells integrated into these billions of devices that will form the Internet of Things. Because simply  we don't want to charge these devices regularly  or worse  replace the batteries every few months. As I said to you  this is the first time I've shown this in public. It's very much a lab demonstration  a prototype. But my team and I are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years. And we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide  and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet. And all of this without causing a massive explosion of energy consumption    because of the solar cells  quite the opposite. Thank you. Jenni Chang  When I told my parents I was gay  the first thing they said to me was   We're bringing you back to Taiwan.  In their minds  my sexual orientation was America's fault. The West had corrupted me with divergent ideas  and if only my parents had never left Taiwan  this would not have happened to their only daughter. In truth  I wondered if they were right. Of course  there are gay people in Asia  just as there are gay people in every part of the world. But is the idea of living an  out  life  in the  I'm gay  this is my spouse  and we're proud of our lives together  kind of way just a Western idea  If I had grown up in Taiwan  or any place outside of the West  would I have found models of happy  thriving LGBT people  Lisa Dazols  I had similar notions. As an HIV social worker in San Francisco  I had met many gay immigrants. They told me their stories of persecution in their home countries  just for being gay  and the reasons why they escaped to the US. I saw how this had beaten them down. After    years of doing this kind of work  I needed better stories for myself. I knew the world was far from perfect  but surely not every gay story was tragic. JC  So as a couple  we both had a need to find stories of hope. So we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the  Supergays.  These would be the LGBT individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world. They would be courageous  resilient  and most of all  proud of who they were. They would be the kind of person that I aspire to be. Our plan was to share their stories to the world through film. LD  There was just one problem. We had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience. We didn't even know where to find the Supergays  so we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way. So we picked    countries in Asia  Africa and South America  countries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights. We bought a camcorder  ordered a book on how to make a documentary    you can learn a lot these days    and set off on an around the world trip. JC  One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal. Despite widespread poverty  a decade long civil war  and now recently  a devastating earthquake  Nepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality. One of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha. A beautiful  vibrant transgendered woman  Bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school and getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation. But  in       Bhumika and Nepal's LGBT rights organization successfully petitioned the Nepali Supreme Court to protect against LGBT discrimination. Here's Bhumika  I'm a transgendered person. I'm so proud of my life. On December           the supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government to give transgender identity cards and same sex marriage. LD  I can appreciate Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis. Something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don't fit in to people's strict gender expectations. Traveling throughout Asia  I tended to freak out women in public restrooms. They weren't used to seeing someone like me. I had to come up with a strategy  so that I could just pee in peace. So anytime I would enter a restroom  I would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts  and try to be as non threatening as possible. Putting out my hands and saying   Hello   just so that people could hear my feminine voice. This all gets pretty exhausting  but it's just who I am. I can't be anything else. JC  After Nepal  we traveled to India. On one hand  India is a Hindu society  without a tradition of homophobia. On the other hand  it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system  which rejects anything that threatens the male female order. When we spoke to activists  they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality  where the women's status is established in society. And in that way  the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well. LD  There we met Prince Manvendra. He's the world's first openly gay prince. Prince Manvendra came out on the  Oprah Winfrey Show   very internationally. His parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family. We sat down with Prince Manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly. Here he is  to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society. And that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself. Whether we are gay  we are lesbian  we are transgender  bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from  we have to all unite and fight for our rights. Gay rights cannot be won in the court rooms  but in the hearts and the minds of the people. JC  While getting my hair cut  the woman cutting my hair asked me   Do you have a husband   Now  this was a dreaded question that I got asked a lot by locals while traveling. When I explained to her that I was with a woman instead of a man  she was incredulous  and she asked me a lot of questions about my parents' reactions and whether I was sad that I'd never be able to have children. I told her that there are no limitations to my life and that Lisa and I do plan to have a family some day. Now  this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy Westerner. She couldn't imagine that such a phenomenon could happen in her own country. That is  until I showed her the photos of the Supergays that we interviewed in India. She recognized Prince Manvendra from television and soon I had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me. And in that ordinary afternoon  I had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country. LD  From India  we traveled to East Africa  a region known for intolerance towards LGBT people. In Kenya     percent of people who come out to their families are disowned. Homosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration. In Kenya  we met the soft spoken David Kuria. David had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government. So he decided to run for senate. He became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate. David wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was. But we were worried for his safety because he started to receive death threats. because they were actually asking for me to be killed. And  yeah  there are some people out there who do it and they feel that they are doing a religious obligation. JC  David wasn't ashamed of who he was. Even in the face of threats  he stayed authentic. LD  At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina. Argentina's a country where    percent of the population identifies as Catholic. Yet  Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive than here in the US. In       Argentina became the first country in Latin America and the   th in the world to adopt marriage equality. There  we met Mar a Rachid. Mar a was a driving force behind that movement. Mar a Rachid  Spanish   I always say that  in reality  the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married. They are for a lot of people that  even though they may never get married  will be perceived differently by their coworkers  their families and neighbors  from the national state's message of equality. I feel very proud of Argentina because Argentina today is a model of equality. And hopefully soon  the whole world will have the same rights. JC  When we made the visit to my ancestral lands  I wish I could have shown my parents what we found there. Because here is who we met  A whole community of young  beautiful Chinese LGBT people. Sure  they had their struggles. But they were fighting it out. In Shanghai  I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group and tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese. In Taipei  each time we got onto the metro  we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands. And we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live. If only my parents knew. LD  By the time we finished our not so straight journey around the world  we had traveled        miles and logged     hours of video footage. We traveled to    countries and interviewed    Supergays. Turns out  it wasn't hard to find them at all. JC  Yes  there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality. And let's not forget that    countries still criminalize homosexuality today. But there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world. What we ultimately took away from our journey is  equality is not a Western invention. LD  One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum  momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world  and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another. When Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination  India pushed harder. When Argentina embraced marriage equality  Uruguay and Brazil followed. When Ireland said yes to equality  the world stopped to notice. When the US Supreme Court makes a statement to the world that we can all be proud of. JC  As we reviewed our footage  what we realized is that we were watching a love story. It wasn't a love story that was expected of me  but it is one filled with more freedom  adventure and love than I could have ever possibly imagined. One year after returning home from our trip  marriage equality came to California. And in the end  we believe  love will win out. by the state of California and by God Almighty  I now pronounce you spouses for life. You may kiss. So whenever I visit a school and talk to students  I always ask them the same thing  Why do you Google  Why is Google the search engine of choice for you  Strangely enough  I always get the same three answers. One   Because it works   which is a great answer  that's why I Google  too. Two  somebody will say   I really don't know of any alternatives.  It's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually   Try to Google the word 'search engine ' you may find a couple of interesting alternatives.  And last but not least  thirdly  inevitably  one student will raise her or his hand and say   With Google  I'm certain to always get the best  unbiased search result.  Certain to always get the best  unbiased search result. Now  as a man of the humanities  albeit a digital humanities man  that just makes my skin curl  even if I  too  realize that that trust  that idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google. I will show you why that  philosophically  is almost an impossibility. But let me first elaborate  just a little bit  on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget. So whenever you set out to Google something  start by asking yourself this   Am I looking for an isolated fact   What is the capital of France  What are the building blocks of a water molecule  Great    Google away. There's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving that it's actually London and H  . You don't see a big conspiracy among those things. We agree  on a global scale  what the answers are to these isolated facts. But if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like   Why is there an Israeli Palestine conflict   You're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore  you're looking for knowledge  which is something way more complicated and delicate. And to get to knowledge  you have to bring    or    or     facts to the table and acknowledge them and say   Yes  these are all true.  But because of who I am  young or old  black or white  gay or straight  I will value them differently. And I will say   Yes  this is true  but this is more important to me than that.  And this is where it becomes interesting  because this is where we become human. This is when we start to argue  to form society. And to really get somewhere  we need to filter all our facts here  through friends and neighbors and parents and children and coworkers and newspapers and magazines  to finally be grounded in real knowledge  which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve. So  I promised you an example just to show you why it's so hard to get to the point of true  clean  objective knowledge    as food for thought. I will conduct a couple of simple queries  search queries. We'll start with  Michelle Obama   the First Lady of the United States. And we'll click for pictures. It works really well  as you can see. It's a perfect search result  more or less. It's just her in the picture  not even the President. How does this work  Quite simple. Google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this  but quite simply  they look at two things more than anything. First  what does it say in the caption under the picture on each website  Does it say  Michelle Obama  under the picture  Pretty good indication it's actually her on there. Second  Google looks at the picture file  the name of the file as such uploaded to the website. Again  is it called  MichelleObama.jpeg   Pretty good indication it's not Clint Eastwood in the picture. So  you've got those two and you get a search result like this    almost. Now  in       Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign  where people set out to insult her through her search results. There was a picture distributed widely over the Internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey. And that picture was published all over. And people published it very  very purposefully  to get it up there in the search results. They made sure to write  Michelle Obama  in the caption and they made sure to upload the picture as  MichelleObama.jpeg   or the like. You get why    to manipulate the search result. And it worked  too. So when you picture Googled for  Michelle Obama  in       that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results. Now  the results are self cleansing  and that's sort of the beauty of it  because Google measures relevance every hour  every day. However  Google didn't settle for that this time  they just thought   That's racist and it's a bad search result and we're going to go back and clean that up manually. We are going to write some code and fix it   which they did. And I don't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea. Me neither. But then  a couple of years go by  and the world's most Googled Anders  Anders Behring Breivik  did what he did. This is July    in       and a terrible day in Norwegian history. This man  a terrorist  blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo  Norway and then he traveled to the island of Ut ya and shot and killed a group of kids. Almost    people died that day. And a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps  that he did two things  he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids. It's not true. It was three steps. He blew up those buildings  he shot those kids  and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him. And he prepared all three steps equally well. And if there was somebody who immediately understood this  it was a Swedish web developer  a search engine optimization expert in Stockholm  named Nikke Lindqvist. He's also a very political guy and he was right out there in social media  on his blog and Facebook. And he told everybody   If there's something that this guy wants right now  it's to control the image of himself. Let's see if we can distort that. Let's see if we  in the civilized world  can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results.  And how  He told all of his readers the following   Go out there on the Internet  find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks    find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks    publish them in your feeds  on your websites  on your blogs. Make sure to write the terrorist's name in the caption  make sure to name the picture file  Breivik.jpeg.  Let's teach Google that that's the face of the terrorist.  And it worked. Two years after that campaign against Michelle Obama  this manipulation campaign against Anders Behring Breivik worked. If you picture Googled for him weeks after the July    events from Sweden  you'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results  as a little protest. Strangely enough  Google didn't intervene this time. They did not step in and manually clean those search results up. So the million dollar question  is there anything different between these two happenings here  Is there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama and what happened to Anders Behring Breivik  Of course not. It's the exact same thing  yet Google intervened in one case and not in the other. Why  Because Michelle Obama is an honorable person  that's why  and Anders Behring Breivik is a despicable person. See what happens there  An evaluation of a person takes place and there's only one power player in the world with the authority to say who's who.  We like you  we dislike you. We believe in you  we don't believe in you. You're right  you're wrong. You're true  you're false. You're Obama  and you're Breivik.  That's power if I ever saw it. So I'm asking you to remember that behind every algorithm is always a person  a person with a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate. And my message goes out not only to Google  but to all believers in the faith of code around the world. You need to identify your own personal bias. You need to understand that you are human and take responsibility accordingly. And I say this because I believe we've reached a point in time when it's absolutely imperative that we tie those bonds together again  tighter  the humanities and the technology. Tighter than ever. And  if nothing else  to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased  clean search result is  and is likely to remain  a myth. Thank you for your time. Religion is more than belief. It's power  and it's influence. And that influence affects all of us  every day  regardless of your own belief. Despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today  we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability than any other sector of our society. For example  if there were a multinational organization  government or corporation today that said no female could be on a leadership board  not one woman could have a decision making authority  not one woman could handle any financial matter  we would have outrage. There would be sanctions. And yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today. We accept things in our religious lives that we do not accept in our secular lives  and I know this because I've been doing it for three decades. I was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up. I played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself. I said I was going to be the first female President of the United States. I have been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment  which has been dead for    years. I'm the first woman in both sides of my family to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education. I never accepted being excluded because I was a woman  except in my religion. Throughout all of that time  I was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox Mormon religion. I grew up in an enormously traditional family. I have eight siblings  a stay at home mother. My father's actually a religious leader in the community. And I grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing was in keeping these rules that I'd known my whole life. You get married a virgin  you never drink alcohol  you don't smoke  you always do service  you're a good kid. Some of the rules we had were strict  but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed. Everything about Mormonism determined what you wore  who you dated  who you married. It determined what underwear we wore. I was the kind of religious where everyone I know donated    percent of everything they earned to the church  including myself. From paper routes and babysitting  I donated    percent. I was the kind of religious where I heard parents tell children when they're leaving on a two year proselytizing mission that they would rather have them die than return home without honor  having sinned. I was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year because they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay. But I was also the kind of religious where it didn't matter where in the world I lived  I had friendship  instantaneous mutual aid. This was where I felt safe. This is certainty and clarity about life. I had help raising my little daughter. So that's why I accepted without question that only men can lead  and I accepted without question that women can't have the spiritual authority of God on the Earth  which we call the priesthood. And I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets  disciplinary councils  in decision making capacities  and I gave my religion a free pass because I loved it. Until I stopped  and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff to the real work of men. And I faced this contradiction in myself  and I joined with other activists in my community. We've been working very  very  very hard for the last decade and more. The first thing we did was raise consciousness. You can't change what you can't see. We started podcasting  blogging  writing articles. I created lists of hundreds of ways that men and women are unequal in our community. The next thing we did was build advocacy organizations. We tried to do things that were unignorable  like wearing pants to church and trying to attend all male meetings. These seem like simple things  but to us  the organizers  they were enormously costly. We lost relationships. We lost jobs. We got hate mail on a daily basis. We were attacked in social media and national press. We received death threats. We lost standing in our community. Some of us got excommunicated. Most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council  and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better  because we believed that they could be. And I began to expect this reaction from my own people. I know what it feels like when you feel like someone's trying to change you or criticize you. But what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work I received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left  the same vehemence as the religious right. And what my secular friends didn't realize was that this religious hostility  these phrases of   Oh  all religious people are crazy or stupid.   Don't pay attention to religion.   They're going to be homophobic and sexist.  What they didn't understand was that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism  it bred religious extremism. Those arguments don't work  and I know because I remember someone telling me that I was stupid for being Mormon. And what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people and everything we believe in  because we're not stupid. So criticism and hostility doesn't work  and I didn't listen to these arguments. When I hear these arguments  I still continue to bristle  because I have family and friends. These are my people  and I'm the first to defend them  but the struggle is real. How do we respect someone's religious beliefs while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage that those beliefs may cause others  It's a tough question. I still don't have a perfect answer. My parents and I have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade. They're intelligent people. They're lovely people. And let me try to help you understand their perspective. In Mormonism  we believe that after you die  if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals  you can be together as a family again. And to my parents  me doing something as simple as having a sleeveless top right now  showing my shoulders  that makes me unworthy. I won't be with my family in the eternities. But even more  I had a brother die in a tragic accident at     and something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family. And to my parents  they cannot understand why something as simple as fashion or women's rights would prevent me from seeing my brother again. And that's the mindset that we're dealing with  and criticism does not change that. And so my parents and I have been walking this tightrope  explaining our sides  respecting one another  but actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs by the way we live our lives  and it's been difficult. The way that we've been able to do that is to get past those defensive shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear. The other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox and the religious right  what they all don't understand was why even care about religious activism  I cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said   If you don't like religion  just leave.  Why would you try to change it  Because what is taught on the Sabbath leaks into our politics  our health policy  violence around the world. It leaks into education  military  fiscal decision making. These laws get legally and culturally codified. In fact  my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation. For example  during Prop    my church raised over    million dollars to fight same sex marriage in California. Forty years ago  political historians will say  that if it wasn't for the Mormon opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment  we'd have an Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution today. How many lives did that affect  And we can spend time fighting every single one of these little tiny laws and rules  or we can ask ourselves  why is gender inequality the default around the world  Why is that the assumption  Because religion doesn't just create the roots of morality  it creates the seeds of normality. Religions can liberate or subjugate  they can empower or exploit  they can comfort or destroy  and the people that tip the scales over to the ethical and the moral are often not those in charge. Religions can't be dismissed or ignored. We need to take them seriously. But it's not easy to influence a religion  like we just talked about. But I'll tell you what my people have done. My groups are small  there's hundreds of us  but we've had huge impact. Right now  women's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men for the first time. Women are now allowed to pray in our church wide meetings  and they never were before in the general conferences. As of last week  in a historic move  three women were invited down to three leadership boards that oversee the entire church. We've seen perceptual shifts in the Mormon community that allow for talk of gender inequality. We've opened up space  regardless of being despised  for more conservative women to step in and make real changes  and the words  women  and  the priesthood  can now be uttered in the same sentence. I never had that. My daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that I never had  that's more equal    we've had an effect. It wasn't easy standing in those lines trying to get into those male meetings. There were hundreds of us  and one by one  when we got to the door  we were told   I'm sorry  this meeting is just for men   and we had to step back and watch men get into the meeting as young as    years old  escorted and walked past us as we all stood in line. But not one woman in that line will forget that day  and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day. If we were a multinational corporation or a government  and that had happened  there would be outrage  but we're just a religion. We're all just part of religions. We can't keep looking at religion that way  because it doesn't only affect me  it affects my daughter and all of your daughters and what opportunities they have  what they can wear  who they can love and marry  if they have access to reproductive healthcare. We need to reclaim morality in a secular context that creates ethical scrutiny and accountability for religions all around the world  but we need to do it in a respectful way that breeds cooperation and not extremism. And we can do it through unignorable acts of bravery  standing up for gender equality. It's time that half of the world's population had voice and equality within our world's religions  churches  synagogues  mosques and shrines around the world. I'm working on my people. What are you doing for yours  It was April        . I was in Baghdad  covering the war in Iraq. That day  Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad. We were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel  and  as happens in war  the fighting began to approach outside our windows. Baghdad was covered in black smoke and oil. It smelled awful. We couldn't see a thing  but we knew what was happening. Of course  I was supposed to be writing an article  but that's how it always goes    you're supposed to be writing and something big happens. So I was in my room on the   th floor  writing and looking out the window every now and then to see what was happening. Suddenly  there was a huge explosion. During the previous three weeks  there had been shelling with half ton missiles  but this time  the shock    I felt it inside of me  and I thought   It's very close. It's very  very close.  So I went down to see what was happening. I went down to the   th floor to take a look. And I saw people  journalists  screaming in the hallways. I walked into a room and realized that it had been hit by a missile. Someone had been wounded. There was a man near the window  a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk  lying face down. Having worked in a hospital before  I wanted to help out. So I turned him over. And when I turned him over  I noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis  but I couldn't see anything  nothing at all. All I saw was a white  pearly  shiny spot that blinded me  and I didn't understand what was going on. Once the spot disappeared and I could see his wound  which was very serious  my buddies and I put a sheet underneath him  and we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the    floors. We put him in a car that took him to the hospital. He died on the way to the hospital. The Spanish cameraman Jos  Couso  who was on the   th floor and also hit    because the shell had exploded between the two floors    died on the operating table. As soon as the car left  I went back. There was that article I was supposed to write    which I had to write. And so    I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood  when one of the hotel gofers stopped me and asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for    days. I told him to get lost. And I said to myself   Clear your head  put it all aside. If you want to write  you need to put it all aside.  And that's what I did. I went upstairs  wrote my article and sent it off. Later  aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues  something else was bothering me. I kept seeing that shiny  pearly spot  and I couldn't understand what it meant. And then  the war was over. Later  I thought   That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened.  Because it wasn't the first time  and it didn't only happen to me. I have seen things like that happen to others in my    to    years of reporting. I have seen things that had an effect on me too. For example  there was this man I knew in Lebanon  a    year old veteran who had been fighting for five years    a real veteran    who we would follow everywhere. He would crawl in the dark with confidence    he was a great soldier  a true soldier    so we would follow him  knowing that we would be safe with him. And one day  as I was told    and I've seen him again since    he was back in the camp  playing cards  when someone came in next door  and discharged their weapon. As the gun went off  that blast  that one shot  made him duck quickly under the table  like a child. He was shaking  panicking. And since then  he has never been able to get up and fight. He ended up working as a croupier in a Beirut casino where I later found him  because he couldn't sleep  so it was quite a suitable job. So I thought to myself   What is this thing that can kill you without leaving any visible scars  How does that happen  What is this unknown thing   It was too common to be coincidental. So I started to investigate    that's all I know how to do. I started to investigate by looking through books  reaching out to psychiatrists  going to museums  libraries  etc. Finally  I discovered that some people knew about this    often military psychiatrists    and that what we were dealing with was called trauma. Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis. It was something that existed  but that we never spoke about. So  this trauma    what is it  Well  it's an encounter with death. I don't know if you've ever had an experience with death    I'm not talking about dead bodies  or someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed  or someone who got hit by a car. I'm talking about facing the void of death. And that is something no one is supposed to see. People used to say   Neither the sun  nor death can be looked at with a steady eye.  A human being should not have to face the void of death. But when that happens  it can remain invisible for a while    days  weeks  months  sometimes years. And then  at some point  it explodes  because it's something that has entered your brain    a sort of window between an image and your mind    that has penetrated your brain  staying there and taking up all the space inside. And there are people    men  women  who suddenly no longer sleep. And they experience horrible anxiety attacks    panic attacks  not just minor fears. They suddenly don't want to sleep  because when they do  they have the same nightmare every night. They see the same image every night. What type of image  For example  a soldier who enters a building and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him. He looks at the gun  straight down the barrel. And this barrel suddenly becomes enormous  deformed. It becomes fluffy  swallowing everything. And he says    later he will say   I saw death. I saw myself dead  therefore I'm dead.  And from then on  he knows he is dead. It is not a perception    he is convinced that he is dead. In reality  someone came in  the guy left or didn't shoot  whatever  and he didn't actually get shot    but to him  he died in that moment. Or it can be the smell of a mass grave    I saw a lot of that in Rwanda. It can be the voice of a friend calling  and they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do. You hear that voice  and you wake up every night    for weeks  months    in a trance like state  anxious and terrified  like a child. I have seen men cry    just like children    from seeing the same image. So having that image of horror in your brain  seeing the void of death    that analogue of horror which is hiding something    will completely take over. You cannot do anything  anything at all. You cannot work anymore  you cannot love anymore. You go home and don't recognize anyone. You don't even recognize yourself. You hide and don't leave the house  you lock yourself in  you become ill. I know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside  in case someone tried to get in. All of a sudden  you feel like you want to die or kill or hide or run away. You want to be loved  but you hate everyone. It's a feeling that seizes you entirely day in and day out  and you suffer tremendously. And no one understands. They say   There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine  you have no injuries. You went to war  came back  you're fine.  These people suffer tremendously. Some commit suicide. After all  suicide is like updating your daily planner    I'm already dead  I might as well commit suicide. Plus  there is no more pain. Some commit suicide  others end up under the bridge  drinking. Everyone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor who used to drink  never said a word  always in a bad mood  beat his wife and who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying. And why do we not talk about this  We don't talk about it because it's taboo. It's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death. But others don't want hear it. The first time I returned from an assignment  They said   Oh  He's back.  There was a fancy dinner    white tablecloth  candles  guests.  Tell us everything   Which I did. After    minutes  people were giving me dirty looks  the hostess had her nose in the ashtray. It was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening. So I don't talk about it anymore. We're just not ready to listen. People say outright   Please  stop.  Is that a rare occurrence  No  it's extremely common. One third of the soldiers who died in Iraq    well  not  died   let me re phrase that    one third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq suffer from PTSD. In       there were still         soldiers from the First World War that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals. In Vietnam         people died    Americans. In       the US government identified            twice as many            veterans who died from committing suicide. Twice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam. So you see  this relates to everything  not just modern warfare  but also ancient wars    you can read about it  the evidence is there. So why do we not talk about it  Why have we not talked about it  The problem is that if you don't talk about it  you're heading for disaster. The only way to heal    and the good news here is that this is treatable    think Munch's The Scream  Goya  etc.    it's indeed treatable. The only way to heal from this trauma  from this encounter with death that overwhelms  petrifies and kills you is to find a way to express it. People used to say   Language is the only thing that holds all of us together.  Without language  we're nothing. It's the thing that makes us human. In the face of such a horrible image    a wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us    the only way to cope with it is to put human words to it. Because these people feel excluded from humanity. No one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone. They feel dirty  defiled  ashamed. Someone said   Doctor  I don't use the subway anymore because I'm afraid people will see the horror in my eyes.  Another guy thought he had a terrible skin disease and spent six months with dermatologists  going from doctor to doctor. And then one day  they sent him to a psychiatrist. During his second session  he told the psychiatrist he had a terrible skin disease from head to toe. The psychiatrist asked   Why are you in this state   And the man said   Well  because I'm dead  so I must be rotting away.  So you see this is something that has a profound effect on people. In order to heal  we need to talk about it. The horror needs to be put into words    human words  so we can organize it and talk about it again. We have to look death in the face. And if we can do that  if we can talk about these things  then step by step  by working it out verbally  we can reclaim our place in humanity. And it is important. Silence kills us. So what does this mean  It means that after a trauma  without question  we lose our  unbearable lightness of being   that sense of immortality that keeps us here    meaning  if we're here  we almost feel like we're immortal  which we're not  but if we didn't believe that  we'd say   What's the point of it all   But trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality. They've lost their lightness. But they have found something else. So this means that if we manage to look death in the face  and actually confront it  rather than keep quiet and hide  like some of the men or women I know did  such as Michael from Rwanda  Carole from Iraq  Philippe from the Congo and other people I know  like Sorj Chalandon  now a great writer  who gave up field assignments after a trauma. Five friends of mine committed suicide  they're the ones who did not survive the trauma. So if we can look death in the face  if we  mortal humans  human mortals  understand that we are human and mortal  mortal and human  if we can confront death and identify it once again as the most mysterious place of all mysterious places  since no one has ever seen it    if we can give it back this meaning  yes  we may die  survive and come back to life  but we'll come back stronger than before. Much stronger. Thank you. This is the Air Jordan   Black Cement. This might be the most important sneaker in history. First released in       this is the shoe that started Nike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled the entire Air Jordan lineage  and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan   Black Cement did for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear with the Black Cement. It's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now  most of you are probably thinking   Sneakers   Yes. Yes  sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related  possibly  to the future of all online commerce. In       the last time the Jordan   Black Cement was released  at a retail of     dollars  it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that  thousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail. In fact  there's over       pairs on eBay right now  four years later. But here's the thing  this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another release or two or three  and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling as the Jordan   Black Cement. This is Nike building the marketplace for sneakerheads    people who collect sneakers    and my daughter. That's an  I love Dad  T shirt. For the brands  sneakerheads are a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers  these are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of        Back to the Future sneakers  Yeah        dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly  the resell sneaker market is definitely not. Thirty years in the making  what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much    Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past    months  there have been over nine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone  at a value of  .  billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate    I should know  I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections  mine doesn't even register. I have about     pairs  but trust me  I am small time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical    year old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball when Michael Jordan played  I always wanted Air Jordans  my mother would never buy me Air Jordans  as soon as I got some money I bought Air Jordans    literally  we all have the exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies  I took a job as a strategy consultant  when I very quickly realized that I didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned  because I had to  and I liked it. So I thought  I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data  just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide  a real data driven view of the market. And four years later  we're analyzing over    million transactions  providing real time analytics on thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases. Others have used the data to validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry. And here's the best part  sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. Sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time  compare it to others  and have access to the same analytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection and identifies which     are his. He can see it's worth         dollars    frankly  a modest collection. At the asset level  he can see gain loss by shoe. Here he's made over     dollars on one pair. I have one of those. So an unregulated  .  billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online  and has spawned fundamental financial services for sneakers  At some point I asked myself what's really going on in the market  and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs  In fact  one guy emailed to say he thought his    year old son was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers. And now they use the data to do it together. And that's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids  You have to be    to play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade  Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school. The cards are long dead  and the candy market's usually quite local. For a lot of people  sneakers are a legal and accessible investment opportunity    a democratized stock market  but also unregulated. Which is why the story you're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely happens and is tragic  it's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe. In fact  it's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade  but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers  that someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market  we know  is   .  billion. Nike  including Jordan brand  accounts for    percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market is about a third. That means that sneakerheads made     million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers  earlier this year  became the number two footwear brand in the country  surpassing Adidas    this was a big deal. And in the    months ending in June  Skechers's net income was     million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor. That    How is that even possible  The sneaker market is just supply and demand  but Nike's gotten very good at using supply    limited sneakers    and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long as it's limited and Nike  they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for       dollars do so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other collectible market  only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike    ingeniously created by Nike  in the most positive sense    to sell more shoes. And in the process  it provided tens of thousands of people with life long passions  myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market  they could do so tomorrow  all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to  nor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple  who will sell an iPhone to anyone who wants one  Nike doesn't make their money by just selling      sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions of people for    dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the PR and the brand cachet  and enable Nike to sell millions of     sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before    this isn't in any textbook. For    years Nike has propped up an artificial commodities market  with a Facebook level hyped IPO every single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at  am on a Saturday morning  and there will be a line down the street and around the block  and sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines you see on the news every other year  Nike lines happen     times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling supply and distribution. But once a pair leaves the retail channel  it's the Wild West. There are very few    if any    legal  unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely not the stock exchange. In fact  there is no central exchange. By last count  there were    different online markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones  some are mobile markets  and then you have consignment shops and brick and mortar stores  and sneaker conventions  and reseller sites  and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter    literally  anywhere sneakerheads come into contact with each other  shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies  no transparency  sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's how stocks were bought  What if the way to buy a share of Apple stock was to search over     places online and off  including every time you walk down the street just hoping to pass someone wearing some Apple stock  Never knowing who had the best price  or even if the stock you were looking at was real. That would surely make you say   WTF   Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how we need to buy sneakers either  What if the inverse is true  and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock  And what if it wasn't just sneakers  but any similar product  like watches and handbags and women's shoes  and any collectible  any seasonal item and any markdown item  What if there was a stock market for commerce  A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner  but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well  maybe you see where this is going. Maybe you want to invest in a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair of Air Jordan   Black Cement in       you could either be wearing them onstage  or have earned     percent on your money    double the S P and    percent more than Apple. And that's why we're talking about sneakers. Thank you. What if I could present you a story that you would remember with your entire body and not just with your mind  My whole life as a journalist  I've really been compelled to try to make stories that can make a difference and maybe inspire people to care. I've worked in print. I've worked in documentary. I've worked in broadcast. But it really wasn't until I got involved with virtual reality that I started seeing these really intense  authentic reactions from people that really blew my mind. So the deal is that with VR  virtual reality  I can put you on scene in the middle of the story. By putting on these goggles that track wherever you look  you get this whole body sensation  like you're actually  like  there. So five years ago was about when I really began to push the envelope with using virtual reality and journalism together. And I wanted to do a piece about hunger. Families in America are going hungry  food banks are overwhelmed  and they're often running out of food. Now  I knew I couldn't make people feel hungry  but maybe I could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical. So    again  this is five years ago    so doing journalism and virtual reality together was considered a worse than half baked idea  and I had no funding. Believe me  I had a lot of colleagues laughing at me. And I did  though  have a really great intern  a woman named Michaela Kobsa Mark. And together we went out to food banks and started recording audio and photographs. Until one day she came back to my office and she was bawling  she was just crying. She had been on scene at a long line  where the woman running the line was feeling extremely overwhelmed  and she was screaming   There's too many people  There's too many people   And this man with diabetes doesn't get food in time  his blood sugar drops too low  and he collapses into a coma. As soon as I heard that audio  I knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece that could really describe what was going on at food banks. So here's the real line. You can see how long it was  right  And again  as I said  we didn't have very much funding  so I had to reproduce it with virtual humans that were donated  and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models and make things as accurate as we could. And then we tried to convey what happened that day with as much as accuracy as is possible. Voice  OK  he's having a seizure. Voice  We need an ambulance. Nonny de la Pe a  So the man on the right  for him  he's walking around the body. For him  he's in the room with that body. Like  that guy is at his feet. And even though  through his peripheral vision  he can see that he's in this lab space  he should be able to see that he's not actually on the street  but he feels like he's there with those people. He's very cautious not to step on this guy who isn't really there  right  So that piece ended up going to Sundance in       a kind of amazing thing  and it was the first virtual reality film ever  basically. And when we went  I was really terrified. I didn't really know how people were going to react and what was going to happen. And we showed up with this duct taped pair of goggles. So you can hear the surprise in my voice  right  And this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw over and over and over  people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim  trying to whisper something into his ear or in some way help  even though they couldn't. And I had a lot of people come out of that piece saying   Oh my God  I was so frustrated. I couldn't help the guy   and take that back into their lives. So after this piece was made  the dean of the cinema school at USC  the University of Southern California  brought in the head of the World Economic Forum to try  Hunger   and he took off the goggles  and he commissioned a piece about Syria on the spot. And I really wanted to do something about Syrian refugee kids  because children have been the worst affected by the Syrian civil war. I sent a team to the border of Iraq to record material at refugee camps  basically an area I wouldn't send a team now  as that's where ISIS is really operating. And then we also recreated a street scene in which a young girl is singing and a bomb goes off. Now  when you're in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds  and you see the injured around you  it's an incredibly scary and real feeling. I've had individuals who have been involved in real bombings tell me that it evokes the same kind of fear.  The civil war in Syria may seem far away   until you experience it yourself.   Project Syria   A virtual reality experience  NP  We were then invited to take the piece to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. And it wasn't advertised. And we were put in this tapestry room. There was no press about it  so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day would see us with these crazy lights. You know  maybe they would want to see the old storytelling of the tapestries. They were confronted by our virtual reality cameras. But a lot of people tried it  and over a five day run we ended up with    pages of guest book comments  and we were told by the curators there that they'd never seen such an outpouring. Things like   It's so real    Absolutely believable   or  of course  the one that I was excited about   A real feeling as if you were in the middle of something that you normally see on the TV news.  So  it works  right  This stuff works. And it doesn't really matter where you're from or what age you are    it's really evocative. Now  don't get me wrong    I'm not saying that when you're in a piece you forget that you're here. But it turns out we can feel like we're in two places at once. We can have what I call this duality of presence  and I think that's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy. Right  So that means  of course  that I have to be very cautious about creating these pieces. I have to really follow best journalistic practices and make sure that these powerful stories are built with integrity. If we don't capture the material ourselves  we have to be extremely exacting about figuring out the provenance and where did this stuff come from and is it authentic  Let me give you an example. With this Trayvon Martin case  this is a guy  a kid  who was    years old and he bought soda and a candy at a store  and on his way home he was tracked by a neighborhood watchman named George Zimmerman who ended up shooting and killing him. To make that piece  we got the architectural drawings of the entire complex  and we rebuilt the entire scene inside and out  based on those drawings. All of the action is informed by the real     recorded calls to the police. And interestingly  we broke some news with this story. The forensic house that did the audio reconstruction  Primeau Productions  they say that they would testify that George Zimmerman  when he got out of the car  he cocked his gun before he went to give chase to Martin. So you can see that the basic tenets of journalism  they don't really change here  right  We're still following the same principles that we would always. What is different is the sense of being on scene  whether you're watching a guy collapse from hunger or feeling like you're in the middle of a bomb scene. And this is kind of what has driven me forward with these pieces  and thinking about how to make them. We're trying to make this  obviously  beyond the headset  more available. We're creating mobile pieces like the Trayvon Martin piece. And these things have had impact. I've had Americans tell me that they've donated  direct deductions from their bank account  money to go to Syrian children refugees. And  Hunger in LA   well  it's helped start a new form of doing journalism that I think is going to join all the other normal platforms in the future. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country. It's three dots there on the globe. Those dots are pretty huge. I think each one is about the size of California. Tell us about Kiribati. Anote Tong  Well  let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care. I think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much. But Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands  the Gilbert Group on the west  we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle  and the Line Islands in the east. And quite frankly  Kiribati is perhaps the only country that is actually in the four corners of the world  because we are in the Northern Hemisphere  in the Southern Hemisphere  and also in the east and the west of the International Date Line. These islands are entirely made up of coral atolls  and on average about two meters above sea level. And so this is what we have. Usually not more than two kilometers in width. And so  on many occasions  I've been asked by people   You know  you're suffering  why don't you move back   They don't understand. They have no concept of what it is that's involved. With the rising sea  they say   Well  you can move back.  And so this is what I tell them. If we move back  we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK  But these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand. CA  So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there. When was it that you yourself realized that there might be impending peril for your country  AT  Well  the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades. And when I came into office in       I began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly  but not with so much passion  because then there was still this controversy among the scientists whether it was human induced  whether it was real or it wasn't. But I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in      with the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC  which made a categorical statement that it is real  it's human induced  and it's predicting some very serious scenarios for countries like mine. And so that's when I got very serious. In the past  I talked about it. We were worried. But when the scenarios  the predictions came in       it became a real issue for us. CA  Now  those predictions are  I think  that by       sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet. There's scenarios where it's higher than that  for sure  but what would you say to a skeptic who said   What's three feet  You're on average six feet above sea level. What's the problem   AT  Well  I think it's got to be understood that a marginal rise in sea level would mean a loss of a lot of land  because much of the land is low. And quite apart from that  we are getting the swells at the moment. So it's not about getting two feet. I think what many people do not understand is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future. Well  we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum. It's already with us. We have communities who already have been dislocated. They have had to move  and every parliament session  I'm getting complaints from different communities asking for assistance to build seawalls  to see what we can do about the freshwater lens because it's being destroyed  and so in my trips to the different islands  I'm seeing evidence of communities which are now having to cope with the loss of food crops  the contamination of the water lenses  and I see these communities perhaps leaving  having to relocate  within five to    years. CA  And then  I think the country suffered its first cyclone  and this is connected  yes  What happened here  AT  Well  we're on the equator  and I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator  it's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones. We create them  and then we send them either north or south. But they aren't supposed to come back. But for the first time  at the beginning of this year  the Cyclone Pam  which destroyed Vanuatu  and in the process  the very edges of it actually touched our two southernmost islands  and all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck. But for our two southernmost islands  we had waves come over half the island  and so this has never happened before. It's a new experience. And I've just come back from my own constituency  and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades  they've been totally destroyed. So this is what's happening  but when we talk about the rising sea level  we think it's something that happens gradually. It comes with the winds  it comes with the swells  and so they can be magnified  but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern  which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level. CA  So the country is already seeing effects now. As you look forward  what are your options as a country  as a nation  AT  Well  I've been telling this story every year. I think I visit a number of    I've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand. We have a plan  we think we have a plan. And on one occasion  I think I spoke in Geneva and there was a gentleman who was interviewing me on something like this  and I said   We are looking at floating islands   and he thought it was funny  but somebody said   No  this is not funny. These people are looking for solutions.  And so I have been looking at floating islands. The Japanese are interested in building floating islands. But  as a country  we have made a commitment that no matter what happens  we will try as much as possible to stay and continue to exist as a nation. What that will take  it's going to be something quite significant  very  very substantial. Either we live on floating islands  or we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe. But even that  it's going to be very  very difficult to get the kind of resourcing that we would need. CA  And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration. AT  Well  we are also looking at that because in the event that nothing comes forward from the international community  we are preparing  we don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe. OK  We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time. We want to be able to give the people the choice today  those who choose and want to do that  to migrate. We don't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate without having been prepared to do so. Of course  our culture is very different  our society is very different  and once we migrate into a different environment  a different culture  there's a whole lot of adjustments that are required. CA  Well  there's forced migration in your country's past  and I think just this week  just yesterday or the day before yesterday  you visited these people. What happened here  What's the story here  AT  Yes  and I'm sorry  I think somebody was asking why we were sneaking off to visit that place. I had a very good reason  because we have a community of Kiribati people living in that part of the Solomon Islands  but these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands  in fact  in the     s. There was serious drought  and the people could not continue to live on the island  and so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands. And so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people. They didn't know who I was. They hadn't heard of me. Some of them later recognized me  but I think they were very happy. Later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally. But I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting because here I see our people. I spoke in our language  and of course they spoke back  they replied  but their accent  they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly. I saw them  there was this lady with red teeth. She was chewing betel nuts  and it's not something we do in Kiribati. We don't chew betel nuts. I met also a family who have married the local people here  and so this is what is happening. As you go into another community  there are bound to be changes. There is bound to be a certain loss of identity  and this is what we will be looking for in the future if and when we do migrate. CA  It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity  the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost. And it's very inspiring to hear you say you're going to fight to the end to try to preserve the nation in a location. AT  This is our wish. Nobody wants ever to leave their home  and so it's been a very difficult decision for me. As a leader  you don't make plans to leave your island  your home  and so I've been asked on a number of occasions   So how do you feel   And it doesn't feel good at all. It's an emotional thing  and I've tried to live with it  and I know that on occasions  I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem because I can't solve the problem. It's something that's got to be done collectively. Climate change is a global phenomenon  and as I've often argued  unfortunately  the countries  when we come to the United Nations    I was in a meeting with the Pacific Island Forum countries where Australia and New Zealand are also members  and we had an argument. There was a bit of a story in the news because they were arguing that to cut emissions  it would be something that they're unable to do because it would affect the industries. And so here I was saying  OK  I hear you  I understand what you're saying  but try also to understand what I'm saying because if you do not cut your emissions  then our survival is on the line. And so it's a matter for you to weigh this  these moral issues. It's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people. CA  You know  I ask you yesterday what made you angry  and you said   I don't get angry.  But then you paused. I think this made you angry. AT  I'd refer you to my earlier statement at the United Nations. I was very angry  very frustrated and then depressed. There was a sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning. I had to change my approach. I had to become more reasonable because I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational  but I remain radically rational  whatever that is. CA  Now  a core part of your nation's identity is fishing. I think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way. AT  Well  we eat fish every day  every day  and I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish is perhaps the highest in the world. We don't have a lot of livestock  so it's fish that we depend on. CA  So you're dependent on fish  both at the local level and for the revenues that the country receives from the global fishing business for tuna  and yet despite that  a few years ago you took a very radical step. Can you tell us about that  I think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands. AT  Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us. We have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world. In the Pacific  I think we own something like    percent of the remaining tuna fisheries  and it remains relatively healthy for some species  but not all. And Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners  tuna resource owners. And at the moment  we have been getting something like    to    percent of our revenue from access fees  license fees. CA  Of your national revenue. AT  National revenue  which drives everything that we do in governments  hospitals  schools and what have you. But we decided to close this  and it was a very difficult decision. I can assure you  politically  locally  it was not easy  but I was convinced that we had to do this in order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable. There had been some indications that some of the species  in particular the bigeye  was under serious threat. The yellowfin was also heavily fished. Skipjack remains healthy. And so we had to do something like that  and so that was the reason I did that. Another reason why I did that was because I had been asking the international community that in order to deal with climate change  in order to fight climate change  there has got to be sacrifice  there has got to be commitment. So in asking the international community to make a sacrifice  I thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice. And so we made the sacrifice. And forgoing commercial fishing in the Phoenix Islands protected area would mean a loss of revenue. We are still trying to assess what that loss would be because we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year  and so we will see by the end of this year what it means in terms of the lost revenue. CA  So there's so many things playing into this. On the one hand  it may prompt healthier fisheries. I mean  how much are you able to move the price up that you charge for the remaining areas  AT  The negotiations have been very difficult  but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day. For any vessel to come in to fish for a day  we have raised the fee from    it was        and         now to                  per vessel day. And so there's been that significant increase. But at the same time  what's important to note is  whereas in the past these fishing boats might be fishing in a day and maybe catch    tons  now they're catching maybe     tons because they've become so efficient. And so we've got to respond likewise. We've got to be very  very careful because the technology has so improved. There was a time when the Brazilian fleet moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They couldn't. They started experimenting if they could  per se. But now they've got ways of doing it  and they've become so efficient. CA  Can you give us a sense of what it's like in those negotiations  Because you're up against companies that have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake  essentially. How do you hold the line  Is there any advice you can give to other leaders who are dealing with the same companies about how to get the most for your country  get the most for the fish  What advice would you give  AT  Well  I think we focus too often on licensing in order to get the rate of return  because what we are getting from license fees is about    percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of the wharf  not in the retail shops. And we only get about    percent. What we have been trying to do over the years is actually to increase our participation in the industry  in the harvesting  in the processing  and eventually  hopefully  the marketing. They're not easy to penetrate  but we are working towards that  and yes  the answer would be to enhance. In order to increase our rate of return  we have to become more involved. And so we've started doing that  and we have to restructure the industry. We've got to tell these people that the world has changed. Now we want to produce the fish ourselves. CA  And meanwhile  for your local fishermen  they are still able to fish  but what is business like for them  Is it getting harder  Are the waters depleted  Or is that being run on a sustainable basis  AT  For the artisanal fishery  we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity except only to supply the domestic market. The tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market  mostly here in the US  Europe  Japan. So I am a fisherman  very much  and I used to be able to catch yellowfin. Now it's very  very rare to be able to catch yellowfin because they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons by these purse seiners. CA  So here's a couple of beautiful girls from your country. I mean  as you think about their future  what message would you have for them and what message would you have for the world  AT  Well  I've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate because for us  it's about the future of these children. I have    grandchildren  at least. I think I have     my wife knows. And I think I have eight children. It's about their future. Every day I see my grandchildren  about the same age as these young girls  and I do wonder  and I get angry sometimes  yes I do. I wonder what is to become of them. And so it's about them that we should be telling everybody  that it's not about their own national interest  because climate change  regrettably  unfortunately  is viewed by many countries as a national problem. It's not. And this is the argument we got into recently with our partners  the Australians and New Zealanders  because they said   We can't cut any more.  This is what one of the leaders  the Australian leader  said  that we've done our part  we are cutting back. I said  What about the rest  Why don't you keep it  If you could keep the rest of your emissions within your boundaries  within your borders  we'd have no question. You can go ahead as much as you like. But unfortunately  you're sending it our way  and it's affecting the future of our children. And so surely I think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today. We will be meeting in Paris at the end of this year  but until we can think of this as a global phenomenon  because we create it  individually  as nations  but it affects everybody else  and yet  we refuse to do anything about it  and we deal with it as a national problem  which it is not    it is a global issue  and it's got to be dealt with collectively. CA  People are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers  and we shut our minds to it. Somehow  to people  we're slightly better at responding to that sometimes. And it seems like it's very possible that your nation  despite  actually because of the intense problems you face  you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly  most powerfully. I just want to thank you   I'm sure  on behalf of all of us  for your extraordinary leadership and for being here. Mr. President  thank you so much. AT  Thank you. Have you ever wondered what animals think and feel  Let's start with a question  Does my dog really love me  or does she just want a treat  Well  it's easy to see that our dog really loves us  easy to see  right  what's going on in that fuzzy little head. What is going on  Something's going on. But why is the question always do they love us  Why is it always about us  Why are we such narcissists  I found a different question to ask animals. Who are you  There are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind. But is that true  What are other beings doing with those brains  What are they thinking and feeling  Is there a way to know  I think there is a way in. I think there are several ways in. We can look at evolution  we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do. The first thing to remember is  our brain is inherited. The first neurons came from jellyfish. Jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates. The first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates. The vertebrates came out of the sea  and here we are. But it's still true that a neuron  a nerve cell  looks the same in a crayfish  a bird or you. What does that say about the minds of crayfish  Can we tell anything about that  Well  it turns out that if you give a crayfish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its burrow  it will develop anxiety. If you give the crayfish the same drug used to treat anxiety disorder in humans  it relaxes and comes out and explores. How do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety  Mostly  we boil them. Octopuses use tools  as well as do most apes and they recognize human faces. How do we celebrate the ape like intelligence of this invertebrate  Mostly boiled. If a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral  it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping and it will signal to the moray   Follow me   and the moray will understand that signal. The moray may go into the crevice and get the fish  but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it. This is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about. How do we celebrate that ancient partnership  Mostly fried. A pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them. Sea otters use tools and they take time away from what they're doing to show their babies what to do  which is called teaching. Chimpanzees don't teach. Killer whales teach and killer whales share food. When evolution makes something new  it uses the parts it has in stock  off the shelf  before it fabricates a new twist. And our brain has come to us through the enormity of the deep sweep of time. If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain  what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain. It's a good thing ours is bigger  because we're also really insecure. But  uh oh  there's a dolphin  a bigger brain with more convolutions. OK  maybe you're saying  all right  well  we see brains  but what does that have to say about minds  Well  we can see the working of the mind in the logic of behaviors. So these elephants  you can see  obviously  they are resting. They have found a patch of shade under the palm trees under which to let their babies sleep  while they doze but remain vigilant. We make perfect sense of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they're doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains  listening to the howls of the same dangers  they became who they are and we became who we are. We've been neighbors for a very long time. No one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed. They're obviously very concerned about something. What are they concerned about  It turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes  elephants will ignore it  because tourists never bother elephants. But if you record the voices of herders who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes  the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker. Not only do elephants know that there are humans  they know that there are different kinds of humans  and that some are OK and some are dangerous. They have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them. They know us better than we know them. We have the same imperatives  take care of our babies  find food  try to stay alive. Whether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa or outfitted for diving under the sea  we are basically the same. We are kin under the skin. The elephant has the same skeleton  the killer whale has the same skeleton  as do we. We see helping where help is needed. We see curiosity in the young. We see the bonds of family connections. We recognize affection. Courtship is courtship. And then we ask   Are they conscious   When you get general anesthesia  it makes you unconscious  which means you have no sensation of anything. Consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something. If you see  if you hear  if you feel  if you're aware of anything  you are conscious  and they are conscious. Some people say well  there are certain things that make humans humans  and one of those things is empathy. Empathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions. It's a very useful thing. If your companions start to move quickly  you have to feel like you need to hurry up. We're all in a hurry now. The oldest form of empathy is contagious fear. If your companions suddenly startle and fly away  it does not work very well for you to say   Jeez  I wonder why everybody just left.  Empathy is old  but empathy  like everything else in life  comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration. So there's basic empathy  you feel sad  it makes me sad. I see you happy  it makes me happy. Then there's something that I call sympathy  a little more removed   I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away. I don't feel that same grief  but I get it  I know what you feel and it concerns me.  And then if we're motivated to act on sympathy  I call that compassion. Far from being the thing that makes us human  human empathy is far from perfect. We round up empathic creatures  we kill them and we eat them. Now  maybe you say OK  well  those are different species. That's just predation  and humans are predators. But we don't treat our own kind too well either. People who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions to other species. Well  I think that's silly  because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species is the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling  because their brains are basically the same as ours. They have the same structures. The same hormones that create mood and motivation in us are in those brains as well. It is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they're hunting and they're tired when their tongues are hanging out  and then say when they're playing with their children and acting joyful and happy  we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything. That is not scientific. So OK  so a reporter said to me   Maybe  but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel   And I started to rifle through all the hundreds of scientific references that I put in my book and I realized that the answer was right in the room with me. When my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me    not to the couch  to me    and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly  she has had the thought   I would like my belly rubbed. I know that I can go over to Carl  he will understand what I'm asking. I know I can trust him because we're family. He'll get the job done  and it will feel good.  She has thought and she has felt  and it's really not more complicated than that. But we see other animals and we say   Oh look  killer whales  wolves  elephants  that's not how they see it.  That tall finned male is L  . He's    years old. The female right on his left side is L  . She's   . They've known each other for decades. They know exactly who they are. They know who their friends are. They know who their rivals are. Their life follows the arc of a career. They know where they are all the time. This is an elephant named Philo. He was a young male. This is him four days later. Humans not only can feel grief  we create an awful lot of it. We want to carve their teeth. Why can't we wait for them to die  Elephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope. In       there were vast strongholds of elephant range in Central and Eastern Africa. And now their range is shattered into little shards. This is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction  a fellow being  the most magnificent creature on land. Of course  we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States. In Yellowstone National Park  we killed every single wolf. We killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border  actually. But in the park  park rangers did that in the     s  and then    years later they had to bring them back  because the elk numbers had gotten out of control. And then people came. People came by the thousands to see the wolves  the most accessibly visible wolves in the world. And I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves. A pack is a family. It has some breeding adults and the young of several generations. And I watched the most famous  most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park. And then  when they wandered just outside the border  two of their adults were killed  including the mother  which we sometimes call the alpha female. The rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry. Sisters kicked out other sisters. That one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family. They wouldn't let her because they were jealous of her. She was getting too much attention from two new males  and she was the precocious one. That was too much for them. She wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot. The alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family. As winter was coming in  he lost his territory  his hunting support  the members of his family and his mate. We cause so much pain to them. The mystery is  why don't they hurt us more than they do  This whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale. Those people in the boat had nothing at all to fear. This whale is T  . He had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions. The seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat. They had nothing to fear. They eat seals. Why don't they eat us  Why can we trust them around our toddlers  Why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers' home was right there on the shoreline  And that's happened more than one time. In the Bahamas  there's a woman named Denise Herzing  and she studies spotted dolphins and they know her. She knows them very well. She knows who they all are. They know her. They recognize the research boat. When she shows up  it's a big happy reunion. Except  one time showed up and they didn't want to come near the boat  and that was really strange. And they couldn't figure out what was going on until somebody came out on deck and announced that one of the people onboard had died during a nap in his bunk. How could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had just stopped  Why would they care  And why would it spook them  These mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on Earth that we almost never think about at all. At an aquarium in South Africa was a little baby bottle nosed dolphin named Dolly. She was nursing  and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool  smoking. Dolly came over and looked at him  went back to her mother  nursed for a minute or two  came back to the window and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke. Somehow  this baby bottle nosed dolphin got the idea of using milk to represent smoke. When human beings use one thing to represent another  we call that art. The things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human. What makes us human is that  of all these things that our minds and their minds have  we are the most extreme. We are the most compassionate  most violent  most creative and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet  and we are all of those things all jumbled up together. But love is not the thing that makes us human. It's not special to us. We are not the only ones who care about our mates. We are not the only ones who care about our children. Albatrosses frequently fly six  sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one meal  one big meal  to their chick who is waiting for them. They nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world  and this is what it looks like. Passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being. If that stops  it all goes away. If anything is sacred  that is  and into that sacred relationship comes our plastic trash. All of these birds have plastic in them now. This is an albatross six months old  ready to fledge    died  packed with red cigarette lighters. This is not the relationship we are supposed to have with the rest of the world. But we  who have named ourselves after our brains  never think about the consequences. When we welcome new human life into the world  we welcome our babies into the company of other creatures. We paint animals on the walls. We don't paint cell phones. We don't paint work cubicles. We paint animals to show them that we are not alone. We have company. And every one of those animals in every painting of Noah's ark  deemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now  and their flood is us. So we started with a question  Do they love us  We're going to ask another question. Are we capable of using what we have to care enough to simply let them continue  Thank you very much. There's something about caves    a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in. As you pass through the portal between light and dark  you enter a subterranean world    a place of perpetual gloom  of earthy smells  of hushed silence. Long ago in Europe  ancient people also entered these underground worlds. As witness to their passage  they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings  like this panel of humans  triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guare a in Spain. You now walk the same path as these early artists. And in this surreal  otherworldly place  it's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth  or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend. When I'm in a cave  I often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark  In this video clip  that was shot half a kilometer  or about a third of a mile  underground  in the cave of Cudon in Spain  we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexplored section of the cave. As we crawled forward  military style  with the ceiling getting ever lower  we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photographer  Dylan  could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera. So while he filmed me  I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a point and shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion. Half a kilometer underground. Seriously. What was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp  I mean    me  it makes sense  right  But you know  this is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research. I study some of the oldest art in the world. It was created by these early artists in Europe  between        and        years ago. And the thing is that I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful  though some of it certainly is. But what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind  of the evolution of creativity  of imagination  of abstract thought  about what it means to be human. While all species communicate in one way or another  only we humans have really taken it to another level. Our desire and ability to share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story. Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange made possible  in large part  by our ability to communicate    in particular  using graphic or written forms of communication. The thing is  though  that we've been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed. It's one of the things I find most fascinating about studying our deep history. Those people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on. They were the original shoulders. And while a surprising number of important inventions come out of that distant time  what I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication. There are three main types of communication  spoken  gestural    so things like sign language    and graphic communication. Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral. It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received. And after the moment of transmission  it's gone forever. Graphic communication  on the other hand  decouples that relationship. And with its invention  it became possible for the first time for a message to be transmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place and time. Europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing in caves  rock shelters and even a few surviving open air sites. But this is not the Europe we know today. This was a world dominated by towering ice sheets  three to four kilometers high  with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra. This was the Ice Age. Over the last century  more than     Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent  decorated with animals  abstract shapes and even the occasional human like these engraved figures from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily. They provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination of these early artists. Since their discovery  it's been the animals that have received the majority of the study like this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain  or this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega. But for me  it was the abstract shapes  what we call geometric signs  that drew me to study the art. The funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images. But when I started on this back in       there wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were  nor was there a strong sense of whether the same ones appeared across space or time. Before I could even get started on my questions  my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites. The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites  usually the ones with the very nice animals  there was also a large number of them where it was very vague    there wasn't a lot of description or detail. Some of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more. These were the ones that I targeted for my field work. Over the course of two years  my faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over     hours underground  hiking  crawling and wriggling around    sites in France  Spain  Portugal and Sicily. And it was totally worth it. We found new  undocumented geometric signs at    percent of the sites we visited. This is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need if I wanted to start answering those larger questions. So let's get to those answers. Barring a handful of outliers  there are only    geometric signs. Only    signs across a        year time span and the entire continent of Europe. That is a very small number. Now  if these were random doodles or decorations  we would expect to see a lot more variation  but instead what we find are the same signs repeating across both space and time. Some signs start out strong  before losing popularity and vanishing  while other signs are later inventions. But    percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period    things like lines  rectangles triangles  ovals and circles like we see here from the end of the Ice Age  at a        year old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains. And while certain signs span thousands of kilometers  other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns  with some being limited to a single territory  like we see here with these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain  and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort of family or clan signs. On a side note  there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art found all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia. With many of the same signs appearing in such far flung places  especially in that        to        year range  it's starting to seem increasingly likely that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa. But that I'm afraid  is a subject for a future talk. So back to the matter at hand. There could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators  like these        year old bas relief sculptures from La Roque de Venasque in France. We might not know what they meant  but the people of the time certainly did. The repetition of the same signs  for so long  and at so many sites tells us that the artists were making intentional choices. If we're talking about geometric shapes  with specific  culturally recognized  agreed upon meanings  than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world. I'm not talking about writing yet. There's just not enough characters at this point to have represented all of the words in the spoken language  something which is a requirement for a full writing system. Nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet. But what we do have are some intriguing one offs  like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain  known as  The Inscription   with its symmetrical markings on the left  possible stylized representations of hands in the middle  and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right. The oldest systems of graphic communication in the world    Sumerian cuneiform  Egyptian hieroglyphs  the earliest Chinese script  all emerged between       and       years ago  with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem made up of counting marks and pictographic representations  where the meaning and the image were the same. So a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal. It's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized  until they almost become unrecognizable and that we also start to see more symbols being invented to represent all those other missing words in language    things like pronouns  adverbs  adjectives. So knowing all this  it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe were truly abstract written characters. Instead  what's much more likely is that these early artists were also making counting marks  maybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily  as well as creating stylized representations of things from the world around them. Could some of the signs be weaponry or housing  Or what about celestial objects like star constellations  Or maybe even rivers  mountains  trees    landscape features  possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell shaped signs from the site of El Castillo in Spain. The term penniform means  feather shaped  in Latin  but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree  Some researchers have begun to ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites  but I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole. The irony in all of this  of course  is that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category  I have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart as different types of imagery are identified and separated off. Now don't get me wrong  the later creation of fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right. But it's important to remember that those early writing systems didn't come out of a vacuum. And that even       years ago  people were already building on something much older  with its origins stretching back tens of thousands of years    to the geometric signs of Ice Age Europe and far beyond  to that point  deep in our collective history  when someone first came up with the idea of making a graphic mark  and forever changed the nature of how we communicate. Thank you. It's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what's on their bookshelves. What do my bookshelves say about me  Well  when I asked myself this question a few years ago  I made an alarming discovery. I'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured  cosmopolitan sort of person. But my bookshelves told a rather different story. Pretty much all the titles on them were by British or North American authors  and there was almost nothing in translation. Discovering this massive  cultural blind spot in my reading came as quite a shock. And when I thought about it  it seemed like a real shame. I knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there by writers working in languages other than English. And it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant I would probably never encounter them. So  I decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading.      was set to be a very international year for the UK  it was the year of the London Olympics. And so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel  short story collection or memoir from every country in the world. And so I did. And it was very exciting and I learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that I want to share with you today. But it started with some practical problems. After I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world to use for my project  I ended up going with the list of UN recognized nations  to which I added Taiwan  which gave me a total of     countries. And after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about  roughly  four books a week around working five days a week  I then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able to get books in English from every country. Only around  .  percent of the literary works published each year in the UK are translations  and the figures are similar for much of the English speaking world. Although  the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher.  .  percent is tiny enough to start with  but what that figure doesn't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles to English language publishers. So  for example  although well over     books are translated from French and published in the UK each year  most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland. French speaking Africa  on the other hand  will rarely ever get a look in. The upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in English. Their books remain invisible to readers of the world's most published language. But when it came to reading the world  the biggest challenge of all for me was that fact that I didn't know where to start. Having spent my life reading almost exclusively British and North American books  I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world. I couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland. I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia. There was no hiding it    I was a clueless literary xenophobe. So how on earth was I going to read the world  I was going to have to ask for help. So in October       I registered my blog  ayearofreadingtheworld.com  and I posted a short appeal online. I explained who I was  how narrow my reading had been  and I asked anyone who cared to to leave a message suggesting what I might read from other parts of the planet. Now  I had no idea whether anyone would be interested  but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online  people started to get in touch. At first  it was friends and colleagues. Then it was friends of friends. And pretty soon  it was strangers. Four days after I put that appeal online  I got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur. She said she loved the sound of my project  could she go to her local English language bookshop and choose my Malaysian book and post it to me  I accepted enthusiastically  and a few weeks later  a package arrived containing not one  but two books    Rafidah's choice from Malaysia  and a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me. Now  at the time  I was amazed that a stranger more than       miles away would go to such lengths to help someone she would probably never meet. But Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year. Time and again  people went out of their way to help me. Some took on research on my behalf  and others made detours on holidays and business trips to go to bookshops for me. It turns out  if you want to read the world  if you want to encounter it with an open mind  the world will help you. When it came to countries with little or no commercially available literature in English  people went further still. Books often came from surprising sources. My Panamanian read  for example  came through a conversation I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter. Yes  the Panama Canal has a Twitter account. And when I tweeted at it about my project  it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work of the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan. I found Morgan's website and I sent him a message  asking if any of his Spanish language novels had been translated into English. And he said that nothing had been published  but he did have an unpublished translation of his novel  The Golden Horse.  He emailed this to me  allowing me to become one of the first people ever to read that book in English. Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way. From Sweden to Palau  writers and translators sent me self published books and unpublished manuscripts of books that hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers or that were no longer available  giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds. I read  for example  about the Southern African king Ngungunhane  who led the resistance against the Portuguese in the   th century  and about marriage rituals in a remote village on the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan. I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones. And I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola. But perhaps the most amazing example of the lengths that people were prepared to go to to help me read the world  came towards the end of my quest  when I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny  Portuguese speaking African island nation of S o Tom  and Pr ncipe. Now  having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find a book that had been translated into English from the nation  it seemed as though the only option left to me was to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch. Now  I was really dubious whether anyone was going to want to help with this  and give up their time for something like that. But  within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook for Portuguese speakers  I had more people than I could involve in the project  including Margaret Jull Costa  a leader in her field  who has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner Jos  Saramago. With my nine volunteers in place  I managed to find a book by a S o Tom an author that I could buy enough copies of online. Here's one of them. And I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers. They all took on a couple of short stories from this collection  stuck to their word  sent their translations back to me  and within six weeks  I had the entire book to read. In that case  as I found so often during my year of reading the world  my not knowing and being open about my limitations had become a big opportunity. When it came to S o Tom  and Pr ncipe  it was a chance not only to learn something new and discover a new collection of stories  but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor. My weakness had become the project's strength. The books I read that year opened my eyes to many things. As those who enjoy reading will know  books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself and into someone else's mindset  so that  for a while at least  you look at the world through different eyes. That can be an uncomfortable experience  particularly if you're reading a book from a culture that may have quite different values to your own. But it can also be really enlightening. Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking. And it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world. When I looked back at much of the English language literature I'd grown up with  for example  I began to see how narrow a lot of it was  compared to the richness that the world has to offer. And as the pages turned  something else started to happen  too. Little by little  that long list of countries that I'd started the year with  changed from a rather dry  academic register of place names into living  breathing entities. Now  I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book. But cumulatively  the stories I read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness  diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet. It was as though the world's stories and the people who'd gone to such lengths to help me read them had made it real to me. These days  when I look at my bookshelves or consider the works on my e reader  they tell a rather different story. It's the story of the power books have to connect us across political  geographical  cultural  social  religious divides. It's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together. And  it's testament to the extraordinary times we live in  where  thanks to the Internet  it's easier than ever before for a stranger to share a story  a worldview  a book with someone she may never meet  on the other side of the planet. I hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come. And I hope many more people will join me. If we all read more widely  there'd be more incentive for publishers to translate more books  and we would all be richer for that. Thank you. Your company launches a search for an open position. The applications start rolling in  and the qualified candidates are identified. Now the choosing begins. Person A  Ivy League   .   flawless resume  great recommendations. All the right stuff. Person B  state school  fair amount of job hopping  and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress. But remember    both are qualified. So I ask you  who are you going to pick  My colleagues and I created very official terms to describe two distinct categories of candidates. We call A  the Silver Spoon   the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success. And we call B  the Scrapper   the one who had to fight against tremendous odds to get to the same point. You just heard a human resources director refer to people as Silver Spoons and Scrappers    which is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental. But before my human resources certification gets revoked    let me explain. A resume tells a story. And over the years  I've learned something about people whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt  that makes me stop and fully consider them before tossing their resumes away. A series of odd jobs may indicate inconsistency  lack of focus  unpredictability. Or it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles. At the very least  the Scrapper deserves an interview. To be clear  I don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon  getting into and graduating from an elite university takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice. But if your whole life has been engineered toward success  how will you handle the tough times  One person I hired felt that because he attended an elite university  there were certain assignments that were beneath him  like temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation. Eventually  he quit. But on the flip side  what happens when your whole life is destined for failure and you actually succeed  I want to urge you to interview the Scrapper. I know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper. Before I was born  my father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia  and he couldn't hold a job in spite of his brilliance. Our lives were one part  Cuckoo's Nest   one part  Awakenings  and one part  A Beautiful Mind.  I'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn  New York. We never owned a home  a car  a washing machine  and for most of my childhood  we didn't even have a telephone. So I was highly motivated to understand the relationship between business success and Scrappers  because my life could easily have turned out very differently. As I met successful business people and read profiles of high powered leaders  I noticed some commonality. Many of them had experienced early hardships  anywhere from poverty  abandonment  death of a parent while young  to learning disabilities  alcoholism and violence. The conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress  and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction. But during studies of dysfunction  data revealed an unexpected insight  that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation. A remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered  which scientists call Post Traumatic Growth. In one study designed to measure the effects of adversity on children at risk  among a subset of     children who experienced the most severe and extreme conditions  fully one third grew up to lead healthy  successful and productive lives. In spite of everything and against tremendous odds  they succeeded. One third. Take this resume. This guy's parents give him up for adoption. He never finishes college. He job hops quite a bit  goes on a sojourn to India for a year  and to top it off  he has dyslexia. Would you hire this guy  His name is Steve Jobs. In a study of the world's most highly successful entrepreneurs  it turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia. In the US     percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia. What's remarkable    among those entrepreneurs who experience post traumatic growth  they now view their learning disability as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage because they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail. They don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity  they know they are who they are because of adversity. They embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they've become  and know that without those experiences  they might not have developed the muscle and grit required to become successful. One of my colleagues had his life completely upended as a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in     . At age     his parents were relocated to the countryside  the schools were closed and he was left alone in Beijing to fend for himself until     when he got a job in a clothing factory. But instead of accepting his fate  he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education. Eleven years later  when the political landscape changed  he heard about a highly selective university admissions test. He had three months to learn the entire curriculum of middle and high school. So  every day he came home from the factory  took a nap  studied until  am  went back to work and repeated this cycle every day for three months. He did it  he succeeded. His commitment to his education was unwavering  and he never lost hope. Today  he holds a master's degree  and his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard. Scrappers are propelled by the belief that the only person you have full control over is yourself. When things don't turn out well  Scrappers ask   What can I do differently to create a better result   Scrappers have a sense of purpose that prevents them from giving up on themselves  kind of like if you've survived poverty  a crazy father and several muggings  you figure   Business challenges     Really  Piece of cake. I got this.  And that reminds me    humor. Scrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times  and laughter helps you change your perspective. And finally  there are relationships. People who overcome adversity don't do it alone. Somewhere along the way  they find people who bring out the best in them and who are invested in their success. Having someone you can count on no matter what is essential to overcoming adversity. I was lucky. In my first job after college  I didn't have a car  so I carpooled across two bridges with a woman who was the president's assistant. She watched me work and encouraged me to focus on my future and not dwell on my past. Along the way I've met many people who've provided me brutally honest feedback  advice and mentorship. These people don't mind that I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college. I'll leave you with one final  valuable insight. Companies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices tend to support Scrappers and outperform their peers. According to DiversityInc  a study of their top    companies for diversity outperformed the S P     by    percent. So back to my original question. Who are you going to bet on  Silver Spoon or Scrapper  I say choose the underestimated contender  whose secret weapons are passion and purpose. Hire the Scrapper. Now... let's go back in time. It's     . There is the gallery somewhere in the world  and there is a young girl  age     standing in the middle of the space. In the front of her is a table. On the table there are    objects for pleasure and for pain. Some of the objects are a glass of water  a coat  a shoe  a rose. But also the knife  the razor blade  the hammer and the pistol with one bullet. There are instructions which say   I'm an object. You can use everything on the table on me. I'm taking all responsibility    even killing me. And the time is six hours.  The beginning of this performance was easy. People would give me the glass of water to drink  they'd give me the rose. But very soon after  there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes  and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach. Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood  and I still have the scar. The women would tell the men what to do. And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening  and it was all public  and they were with their wives. They carried me around and put me on the table  and put the knife between my legs. And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple. And another person took the pistol and they started a fight. And after six hours were finished  I... started walking towards the public. I was a mess. I was half naked  I was full of blood and tears were running down my face. And everybody escaped  they just ran away. They could not confront myself  with myself as a normal human being. And then    what happened is I went to the hotel  it was at two in the morning. And I looked at myself in the mirror  and I had a piece of gray hair. Alright    please take off your blindfolds. Welcome to the performance world. First of all  let's explain what the performance is. So many artists  so many different explanations  but my explanation for performance is very simple. Performance is a mental and physical construction that the performer makes in a specific time in a space in front of an audience and then energy dialogue happens. The audience and the performer make the piece together. And the difference between performance and theater is huge. In the theater  the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup. In the performance  the blood is the material  and the razor blade or knife is the tool. It's all about being there in the real time  and you can't rehearse performance  because you can't do many of these types of things twice    ever. Which is very important  the performance is    you know  all human beings are always afraid of very simple things. We're afraid of suffering  we're afraid of pain  we're afraid of mortality. So what I'm doing    I'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience. I'm using your energy  and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can. And then I liberate myself from these fears. And I'm your mirror. If I can do this for myself  you can do it for you. After Belgrade  where I was born  I went to Amsterdam. And you know  I've been doing performances since the last    years. And here I met Ulay  and he was the person I actually fell in love with. And we made  for    years  performances together. You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets  I exchange into love and trust. So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely because this arrow is pointing to my heart. So  heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on  is about trust  is about total trust to another human being. Our relationship was    years  and we worked on so many subjects  both male and female energy. And as every relationship comes to an end  ours went too. We didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do and say  you know   This is over.  We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye. I started at the Yellow Sea  and he started from the Gobi Desert. We walked  each of us  three months  two and a half thousand kilometers. It was the mountains  it was difficult. It was climbing  it was ruins. It was  you know  going through the    Chinese provinces  this was before China was open in '  . And we succeeded to meet in the middle to say goodbye. And then our relationship stopped. And now  it completely changed how I see the public. And one very important piece I made in those days was  Balkan Baroque.  And this was the time of the Balkan Wars  and I wanted to create some very strong  charismatic image  something that could serve for any war at any time  because the Balkan Wars are now finished  but there's always some war  somewhere. So here I am washing two and a half thousand dead  big  bloody cow bones. You can't wash the blood  you never can wash shame off the wars. So I'm washing this six hours  six days  and wars are coming off these bones  and becoming possible    an unbearable smell. But then something stays in the memory. I want to show you the one who really changed my life  and this was the performance in MoMa  which I just recently made. This performance    when I said to the curator   I'm just going to sit at the chair  and there will be an empty chair at the front  and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want.  The curator said to me   That's ridiculous  you know  this is New York  this chair will be empty  nobody has time to sit in front of you.  But I sit for three months. And I sit everyday  eight hours    the opening of the museum    and    hours on Friday when the museum is open    hours  and I never move. And I removed the table and I'm still sitting  and this changed everything. This performance  maybe    or    years ago    nothing would have happened. But the need of people to actually experience something different  the public was not anymore the group    relation was one to one. I was watching these people  they would come and sit in front of me  but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours to get to this position  and finally  they sit. And what happened  They are observed by the other people  they're photographed  they're filmed by the camera  they're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves. And that makes a difference. There was so much pain and loneliness  there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes  because in the gaze with that total stranger  that you never even say one word    everything happened. And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months  I am not the same anymore. And I understood that I have a very strong mission  that I have to communicate this experience to everybody. And this is how  for me  was born the idea to have an institute of immaterial performing arts. Because thinking about immateriality  performance is time based art. It's not like a painting. You have the painting on the wall  the next day it's there. Performance  if you are missing it  you only have the memory  or the story of somebody else telling you  but you actually missed the whole thing. So you have to be there. And in my point  if you talk about immaterial art  music is the highest    absolutely highest art of all  because it's the most immaterial. And then after this is performance  and then everything else. That's my subjective way. This institute is going to happen in Hudson  upstate New York  and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas  an idea. And it's very simple. If you want to get experience  you have to give me your time. You have to sign the contract before you enter the building  that you will spend there a full six hours  you have to give me your word of honor. It's something so old fashioned  but if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before    that's not my problem. But it's six hours  the experience. And then after you finish  you get a certificate of accomplishment  so get home and frame it if you want. This is orientation hall. The public comes in  and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats. It's this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter. And then you go to the lockers and you put your watch  your iPhone  your iPod  your computer and everything digital  electronic. And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time. Because there is nothing wrong with technology  our approach to technology is wrong. We are losing the time we have for ourselves. This is an institute to actually give you back this time. So what you do here  first you start slow walking  you start slowing down. You're going back to simplicity. After slow walking  you're going to learn how to drink water    very simple  drinking water for maybe half an hour. After this  you're going to the magnet chamber  where you're going to create some magnet streams on your body. Then after this  you go to crystal chamber. After crystal chamber  you go to eye gazing chamber  after eye gazing chamber  you go to a chamber where you are lying down. So it's the three basic positions of the human body  sitting  standing and lying. And slow walking. And there is a sound chamber. And then after you've seen all of this  and prepared yourself mentally and physically  then you are ready to see something with a long duration  like in immaterial art. It can be music  it can be opera  it can be a theater piece  it can be film  it can be video dance. You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable. In the long duration chairs  you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work. And if you fall asleep  which is very possible because it's been a long day  you're going to be transported to the parking lot. And you know  sleeping is very important. In sleeping  you're still receiving art. So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time  and then after this you just  you know  go back  you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate. So this institute right now is virtual. Right now  I am just making my institute in Brazil  then it's going to be in Australia  then it's coming here  to Canada and everywhere. And this is to experience a kind of simple method  how you go back to simplicity in your own life. Counting rice will be another thing. You know  if you count rice you can make life  too. How to count rice for six hours  It's incredibly important. You know  you go through this whole range of being bored  being angry  being completely frustrated  not finishing the amount of rice you're counting. And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished    or counting sand in the desert. Or having the sound isolated situation    that you have headphones  that you don't hear anything  and you're just there together without sound  with the people experiencing silence  just the simple silence. We are always doing things we like in our life. And this is why you're not changing. You do things in life    it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way. But my method is to do things I'm afraid of  the things I fear  the things I don't know  to go to territory that nobody's ever been. And then also to include the failure. I think failure is important because if you go  if you experiment  you can fail. If you don't go into that area and you don't fail  you are actually repeating yourself over and over again. And I think that human beings right now need a change  and the only change to be made is a personal level change. You have to make the change on yourself. Because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us  is to start with yourself. It's so easy to criticize how it's different  the things in the world and they're not right  and the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world and there's wars    the killing. But what we do on the personal level    what is our contribution to this whole thing  Can you turn to your neighbor  the one you don't know  and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes  right now  I'm asking two minutes of your time  that's so little. Breathe slowly  don't try to blink  don't be self conscious. Be relaxed. And just look a complete stranger in your eyes  in his eyes. Thank you for trusting me. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you so much.
