I want to tell you how        remarkable young people from over     countries ended up in Cuba and are transforming health in their communities. Ninety percent of them would never have left home at all if it weren't for a scholarship to study medicine in Cuba and a commitment to go back to places like the ones they'd come from   remote farmlands  mountains  ghettos   to become doctors for people like themselves  to walk the walk. Havana's Latin American Medical School  It's the largest medical school in the world  graduating        young doctors since its first class of       with nearly        more in the pipeline. Its mission  to train physicians for the people who need them the most  the over one billion who have never seen a doctor  the people who live and die under every poverty line ever invented. Its students defy all norms. They're the school's biggest risk and also its best bet. They're recruited from the poorest  most broken places on our planet by a school that believes they can become not just the good but the excellent physicians their communities desperately need  that they will practice where most doctors don't  in places not only poor but oftentimes dangerous  carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks or navigating neighborhoods riddled by drugs  gangs and bullets  their home ground. The hope is that they will help transform access to care  the health picture in impoverished areas  and even the way medicine itself is learned and practiced  and that they will become pioneers in our global reach for universal health coverage  surely a tall order. Two big storms and this notion of  walk the walk  prompted creation of ELAM back in     . The Hurricanes Georges and Mitch had ripped through the Caribbean and Central America  leaving        dead and two and a half million homeless. Hundreds of Cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response  but when they got there  they found a bigger disaster  whole communities with no healthcare  doors bolted shut on rural hospitals for lack of staff  and just too many babies dying before their first birthday. What would happen when these Cuban doctors left  New doctors were needed to make care sustainable  but where would they come from  Where would they train  In Havana  the campus of a former naval academy was turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry to become the Latin American Medical School  ELAM. Tuition  room and board  and a small stipend were offered to hundreds of students from the countries hardest hit by the storms. As a journalist in Havana  I watched the first    Nicaraguans arrive in March       settling into dorms barely refurbished and helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms but move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes. Over the next few years  governments throughout the Americas requested scholarships for their own students  and the Congressional Black Caucus asked for and received hundreds of scholarships for young people from the USA. Today  among the        are graduates from    countries in the Americas  Africa and Asia  and enrollment has grown to     nations. More than half the students are young women. They come from     ethnic groups  speak    different languages. WHO Director Margaret Chan said   For once  if you are poor  female  or from an indigenous population  you have a distinct advantage  an ethic that makes this medical school unique.  Luther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho on the Atlantic coast of Honduras. There's no running water  no electricity there  and to reach the village  you have to walk for hours or take your chances in a pickup truck like I did skirting the waves of the Atlantic. Luther was one of    Tocamacho children who started grammar school  the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people known as the Gar funa     percent of the Honduran population. The nearest healthcare was fatal miles away. Luther had to walk three hours every day to middle school. Only    made that trip. Only five went on to high school  and only one to university  Luther  to ELAM  among the first crop of Gar funa graduates. Just two Gar funa doctors had preceded them in all of Honduran history. Now there are     thanks to ELAM. Big problems need big solutions  sparked by big ideas  imagination and audacity  but also solutions that work. ELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base to guide them  so they learned the hard way  by doing and correcting course as they went. Even the brightest students from these poor communities weren't academically prepared for six years of medical training  so a bridging course was set up in sciences. Then came language  these were Mapuche  Quechuas  Guaran   Gar funa  indigenous peoples who learned Spanish as a second language  or Haitians who spoke Creole. So Spanish became part of the pre pre med curriculum. Even so  in Cuba  the music  the food  the smells  just about everything was different  so faculty became family  ELAM home. Religions ranged from indigenous beliefs to Yoruba  Muslim and Christian evangelical. Embracing diversity became a way of life. Why have so many countries asked for these scholarships  First  they just don't have enough doctors  and where they do  their distribution is skewed against the poor  because our global health crisis is fed by a crisis in human resources. We are short four to seven million health workers just to meet basic needs  and the problem is everywhere. Doctors are concentrated in the cities  where only half the world's people live  and within cities  not in the shantytowns or South L.A. Here in the United States  where we have healthcare reform  we don't have the professionals we need. By       we will be short        primary care physicians. And we're also part of the problem. The United States is the number one importer of doctors from developing countries. The second reasons students flock to Cuba is the island's own health report card  relying on strong primary care. A commission from The Lancet rates Cuba among the best performing middle income countries in health. Save the Children ranks Cuba the best country in Latin America to become a mother. Cuba has similar life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the United States  with fewer disparities  while spending per person one   th of what we do on health here in the USA. Academically  ELAM is tough  but    percent of its students graduate. The subjects are familiar   basic and clinical sciences   but there are major differences. First  training has moved out of the ivory tower and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods  the kinds of places most of these grads will practice. Sure  they have lectures and hospital rotations too  but community based learning starts on day one. Second  students treat the whole patient  mind and body  in the context of their  families  their communities and their culture. Third  they learn public health  to assess their patients' drinking water  housing  social and economic conditions. Fourth  they are taught that a good patient interview and a thorough clinical exam provide most of the clues for diagnosis  saving costly technology for confirmation. And finally  they're taught over and over again the importance of prevention  especially as chronic diseases cripple health systems worldwide. Such an in service learning also comes with a team approach  as much how to work in teams as how to lead them  with a dose of humility. Upon graduation  these doctors share their knowledge with nurse's aids  midwives  community health workers  to help them become better at what they do  not to replace them  to work with shamans and traditional healers. ELAM's graduates  Are they proving this audacious experiment right  Dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they're capable of doing. Take the Gar funa grads. They not only went to work back home  but they organized their communities to build Honduras' first indigenous hospital. With an architect's help  residents literally raised it from the ground up. The first patients walked through the doors in December       and since then  the hospital has received nearly one million patient visits. And government is paying attention  upholding the hospital as a model of rural public health for Honduras. ELAM's graduates are smart  strong and also dedicated. Haiti  January     . The pain. People buried under    million tons of rubble. Overwhelming. Three hundred forty Cuban doctors were already on the ground long term. More were on their way. Many more were needed. At ELAM  students worked round the clock to contact       graduates. As a result  hundreds arrived in Haiti     countries' worth  from Mali in the Sahara to St. Lucia  Bolivia  Chile and the USA. They spoke easily to each other in Spanish and listened to their patients in Creole thanks to Haitian medical students flown in from ELAM in Cuba. Many stayed for months  even through the cholera epidemic. Hundreds of Haitian graduates had to pick up the pieces  overcome their own heartbreak  and then pick up the burden of building a new public health system for Haiti. Today  with aid of organizations and governments from Norway to Cuba to Brazil  dozens of new health centers have been built  staffed  and in    cases  headed by ELAM graduates. Yet the Haitian story also illustrates some of the bigger problems faced in many countries. Take a look      Haitian graduates by        when cholera struck  nearly half working in the public health sector but one quarter unemployed  and     had left Haiti altogether. So in the best case scenarios  these graduates are staffing and thus strengthening public health systems  where often they're the only doctors around. In the worst cases  there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector  where most poor people are treated  not enough political will  not enough resources  not enough anything   just too many patients with no care. The grads face pressure from their families too  desperate to make ends meet  so when there are no public sector jobs  these new MDs decamp into private practice  or go abroad to send money home. Worst of all  in some countries  medical societies influence accreditation bodies not to honor the ELAM degree  fearful these grads will take their jobs or reduce their patient loads and income. It's not a question of competencies. Here in the USA  the California Medical Board accredited the school after rigorous inspection  and the new physicians are making good on Cuba's big bet  passing their boards and accepted into highly respected residencies from New York to Chicago to New Mexico. Two hundred strong  they're coming back to the United States energized  and also dissatisfied. As one grad put it  in Cuba   We are trained to provide quality care with minimal resources  so when I see all the resources we have here  and you tell me that's not possible  I know it's not true. Not only have I seen it work  I've done the work.  ELAM's graduates  some from right here in D.C. and Baltimore  have come from the poorest of the poor to offer health  education and a voice to their communities. They've done the heavy lifting. Now we need to do our part to support the        and counting  All of us   foundations  residency directors  press  entrepreneurs  policymakers  people   need to step up. We need to do much more globally to give these new doctors the opportunity to prove their mettle. They need to be able to take their countries' licensing exams. They need jobs in the public health sector or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work. They need the chance to be the doctors their patients need. To move forward  we may have to find our way back to that pediatrician who would knock on my family's door on the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid  who made house calls  who was a public servant. These aren't such new ideas of what medicine should be. What's new is the scaling up and the faces of the doctors themselves  an ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she than a he  In the Amazon  Peru or Guatemala  an indigenous doctor  in the USA  a doctor of color who speaks fluent Spanish. She is well trained  can be counted on  and shares the face and culture of her patients  and she deserves our support surely  because whether by subway  mule  or canoe  she is teaching us to walk the walk. Thank you.  Applause  Today I want to tell you about a project being carried out by scientists all over the world to paint a neural portrait of the human mind. And the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single  general purpose processor  but a collection of highly specialized components  each solving a different specific problem  and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers. To give you a feel for this idea  imagine the following scenario  You walk into your child's day care center. As usual  there's a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up  but this time  the children's faces look weirdly similar  and you can't figure out which child is yours. Do you need new glasses  Are you losing your mind  You run through a quick mental checklist. No  you seem to be thinking clearly  and your vision is perfectly sharp. And everything looks normal except the children's faces. You can see the faces  but they don't look distinctive  and none of them looks familiar  and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter. This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people. It's called prosopagnosia  and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain. The striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired  everything else is just fine. Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific mental deficits that can happen after brain damage. These syndromes collectively have suggested for a long time that the mind is divvied up into distinct components  but the effort to discover those components has jumped to warp speed with the invention of brain imaging technology  especially MRI. So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy at high resolution  so I'm going to show you in a second a set of MRI cross sectional images through a familiar object  and we're going to fly through them and you're going to try to figure out what the object is. Here we go. It's not that easy. It's an artichoke. Okay  let's try another one  starting from the bottom and going through the top. Broccoli  It's a head of broccoli. Isn't it beautiful  I love that. Okay  here's another one. It's a brain  of course. In fact  it's my brain. We're going through slices through my head like that. That's my nose over on the right  and now we're going over here  right there. So this picture's nice  if I do say so myself  but it shows only anatomy. The really cool advance with functional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just anatomy but activity  that is  where neurons are firing. So here's how this works. Brains are like muscles. When they get active  they need increased blood flow to supply that activity  and lucky for us  blood flow control to the brain is local  so if a bunch of neurons  say  right there get active and start firing  then blood flow increases just right there. So functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase  producing a higher MRI response where neural activity goes up. So to give you a concrete feel for how a functional MRI experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can't  let me describe one of the first studies I ever did. We wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces  and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia that I described a moment ago  but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain in a normal person  so we set out to look for it. So I was the first subject. I went into the scanner  I lay on my back  I held my head as still as I could while staring at pictures of faces like these and objects like these and faces and objects for hours. So as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner  I can tell you that one of the skills that's really important for MRI research is bladder control. When I got out of the scanner  I did a quick analysis of the data  looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects  and here's what I saw. Now this image looks just awful by today's standards  but at the time I thought it was beautiful. What it shows is that region right there  that little blob  it's about the size of an olive and it's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there. And what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher MRI response  that is  higher neural activity  when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects. So that's pretty cool  but how do we know this isn't a fluke  Well  the easiest way is to just do the experiment again. So I got back in the scanner  I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects and I got a similar blob  and then I did it again and I did it again and again and again  and around about then I decided to believe it was for real. But still  maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there  so to find out  we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain. So the next question was  what does this thing really do  Is it really specialized just for face recognition  Well  maybe not  right  Maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part. Maybe it responds to anything human or anything alive or anything round. The only way to be really sure that that region is specialized for face recognition is to rule out all of those hypotheses. So we spent much of the next couple of years scanning subjects while they looked at lots of different kinds of images  and we showed that that part of the brain responds strongly when you look at any images that are faces of any kind  and it responds much less strongly to any image you show that isn't a face  like some of these. So have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face recognition  No  we haven't. Brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything. All you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts. To tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function  you need to mess with it and see what happens  and normally we don't get to do that. But an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here in his hospital bed where he's just had electrodes placed on the surface of his brain to identify the source of his seizures. So it turned out by total chance that two of the electrodes happened to be right on top of his face area. So with the patient's consent  the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain. Now  the patient doesn't know where those electrodes are  and he's never heard of the face area. So let's watch what happens. It's going to start with a control condition that will say  Sham  nearly invisibly in red in the lower left  when no current is delivered  and you'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first. So let's watch. and tell me what happens when I do this. All right  Patient  Okay. Neurologist  One  two  three. Patient  Nothing. Neurologist  Nothing  Okay. I'm going to do it one more time. Look at my face. One  two  three. Patient  You just turned into somebody else. Your face metamorphosed. Your nose got saggy  it went to the left. You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before  but somebody different. That was a trip. Nancy Kanwisher  So this experiment   this experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only selectively responsive to faces but causally involved in face perception. So I went through all of these details about the face region to show you what it takes to really establish that a part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process. Next  I'll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found. So to do this  I've spent a lot of time in the scanner over the last month so I can show you these things in my brain. So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere. So we're oriented like that. You're looking at my head this way. Imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that. Okay  now as you can see  the surface of the brain is all folded up. So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there. We want to see the whole thing  so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing. Next  let's find that face area I've been talking about that responds to images like these. To see that  let's turn the brain around and look on the inside surface on the bottom  and there it is  that's my face area. Just to the right of that is another region that is shown in purple that responds when you process color information  and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places  like right now  I'm seeing this layout of space around me and these regions in green right there are really active. There's another one out on the outside surface again where there's a couple more face regions as well. Also in this vicinity is a region that's selectively involved in processing visual motion  like these moving dots here  and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain  and near that is a region that responds when you look at images of bodies and body parts like these  and that region is shown in lime green at the bottom of the brain. Now all these regions I've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception. Do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses  like hearing  Yes  we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit  here's a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago  and this region responds strongly when you hear sounds with pitch  like these. In contrast  that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don't have a clear pitch  like these. Okay. Next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech. Okay  now let's look at these same regions. In my left hemisphere  there's a similar arrangement   not identical  but similar   and most of the same regions are in here  albeit sometimes different in size. Now  everything I've shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception  vision and hearing. Do we also have specialized brain regions for really fancy  complicated mental processes  Yes  we do. So here in pink are my language regions. So it's been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language  but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively. They respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence  but not when you do other complex mental things  like mental arithmetic or holding information in memory or appreciating the complex structure in a piece of music. The most amazing region that's been found yet is this one right here in turquoise. This region responds when you think about what another person is thinking. So that may seem crazy  but actually  we humans do this all the time. You're doing this when you realize that your partner is going to be worried if you don't call home to say you're running late. I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now when I realize that you guys are probably now wondering about all that gray  uncharted territory in the brain  and what's up with that  Well  I'm wondering about that too  and we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions. But importantly  I don't think we have specializations in the brain for every important mental function  even mental functions that may be critical for survival. In fact  a few years ago  there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he'd found a brain region for detecting food  and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this. And further  he found a similar response in more or less the same location in    out of    subjects. So he was pretty stoked  and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on  Oprah  with his big discovery. But then he devised the critical test  He showed subjects images of food like this and compared them to images with very similar color and shape  but that weren't food  like these. And his region responded the same to both sets of images. So it wasn't a food area  it was just a region that liked colors and shapes. So much for  Oprah.  But then the question  of course  is  how do we process all this other stuff that we don't have specialized brain regions for  Well  I think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that I've been describing  we also have a lot of very general  purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along. In fact  we've shown recently that these regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all   well  of the seven that we've tested. So each of the brain regions that I've described to you today is present in approximately the same location in every normal subject. I could take any of you  pop you in the scanner  and find each of those regions in your brain  and it would look a lot like my brain  although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size. What's important to me about this work is not the particular locations of these brain regions  but the simple fact that we have selective  specific components of mind and brain in the first place. I mean  it could have been otherwise. The brain could have been a single  general purpose processor  more like a kitchen knife than a Swiss Army knife. Instead  what brain imaging has delivered is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind. So we have this picture of very general purpose machinery in our heads in addition to this surprising array of very specialized components. It's early days in this enterprise. We've painted only the first brushstrokes in our neural portrait of the human mind. The most fundamental questions remain unanswered. So for example  what does each of these regions do exactly  Why do we need three face areas and three place areas  and what's the division of labor between them  Second  how are all these things connected in the brain  With diffusion imaging  you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain  and with this method shown here  you can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain  potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain. Third  how does all of this very systematic structure get built  both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species  To address questions like that  scientists are now scanning other species of animals  and they're also scanning human infants. Many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism. That's a hugely important goal  and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it  but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that's worth doing. The effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease. What could be more thrilling than to understand the fundamental mechanisms that underlie human experience  to understand  in essence  who we are  This is  I think  the greatest scientific quest of all time. Recently  I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George Frideric Handel. I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam  again playing music by this same composer. Let's take a look. I actually live there  around the corner. and you'd be really welcome. Man   In Dutch  Does that sound like fun  Child   In Dutch  Yes    In Dutch   Handel house concert   Daria van den Bercken  All this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons. Now you may ask  why have I done these things  They're not really typical for a musician's day to day life. Well  I did it because I fell in love with the music and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible. It started a couple of years ago. I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little  when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard. Well  I was surprised. I did not know this. So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing. And what happened next was that I entered this state of pure  unprejudiced amazement. It was an experience of being totally in awe of the music  and I had not felt that in a long time. It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it. The first piece that I played through started like this. Well this sounds very melancholic  doesn't it  And I turned the page and what came next was this. Well  this sounds very energetic  doesn't it  So within a couple of minutes  and the piece isn't even finished yet  I experienced two very contrasting characters  beautiful melancholy and sheer energy. And I consider these two elements to be vital human expressions. And the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively. I've given a lot of children's concerts for children of seven and eight years old  and whatever I play  whether it's Bach  Beethoven  even Stockhausen  or some jazzy music  they are open to hear it  really willing to listen  and they are comfortable doing so. And when classes come in with children who are just a few years older          I felt that I sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that. The complexity of the music does become an issue  and actually the opinions of others   parents  friends  media   they start to count. But the young ones  they don't question their own opinion. They are in this constant state of wonder  and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven year old children  even when growing up. And that is why I have played not only in the concert hall but also on the street  online  in the air  to feel that state of wonder  to truly listen  and to listen without prejudice. And I would like to invite you to do so now. Thank you. It's very nice to be here tonight. So I've been working on the history of income and wealth distribution for the past    years  and one of the interesting lessons coming from this historical evidence is indeed that  in the long run  there is a tendency for  the rate of return of capital to exceed the economy's growth rate  and this tends to lead to  high concentration of wealth. Not infinite concentration of wealth  but the higher the gap between r and g  the higher the level of inequality of wealth towards which society tends to converge. So this is a key force that I'm going to talk about today  but let me say right away that this is not the only important force in the dynamics of income  and wealth distribution  and there are many other forces that play an important role in the long run dynamics of income and wealth distribution. Also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected. We know a little bit more today than we used to know   but we still know too little  and certainly there are  many different processes   economic  social  political   that need to be studied more. And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force  but that doesn't mean that other important forces do not exist. So most of the data I'm going to present comes from this database that's available online  the World Top Incomes Database. So this is the largest existing historical database on inequality  and this comes from the effort of over    scholars from several dozen countries. So let me show you a couple of facts coming from this database  and then we'll return to r bigger than g. So fact number one is that there has been a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality between the United States and Europe over the past century. So back in             income inequality was actually much higher in Europe than in the United States  whereas today  it is a lot higher in the United States. So let me be very clear  The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g. It has more to do with changing supply and demand for skill  the race between education and technology  globalization  probably more unequal access to skills in the U.S.  where you have very good  very top universities but where the bottom part of the educational system is not as good  so very unequal access to skills  and also an unprecedented rise of top managerial compensation of the United States  which is difficult to account for just on the basis of education. So there is more going on here  but I'm not going to talk too much about this today  because I want to focus on wealth inequality. So let me just show you a very simple indicator about the income inequality part. So this is the share of total income going to the top    percent. So you can see that one century ago  it was between    and    percent in Europe and a little bit above    percent in the U.S.  so there was more inequality in Europe. Then there was a sharp decline during the first half of the   th century  and in the recent decade  you can see that the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe  and this is the first fact I just talked about. Now  the second fact is more about wealth inequality  and here the central fact is that wealth inequality is always a lot higher than income inequality  and also that wealth inequality  although it has also increased in recent decades  is still less extreme today than what it was a century ago  although the total quantity of wealth relative to income has now recovered from the very large shocks caused by World War I  the Great Depression  World War II. So let me show you two graphs illustrating fact number two and fact number three. So first  if you look at the level of wealth inequality  this is the share of total wealth going to the top    percent of wealth holders  so you can see the same kind of reversal between the U.S. and Europe that we had before for income inequality. So wealth concentration was higher in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago  and now it is the opposite. But you can also show two things  First  the general level of wealth inequality is always higher than income inequality. So remember  for income inequality  the share going to the top    percent was between    and    percent of total income  whereas for wealth  the share is always between    and    percent. Okay  so that's fact number one  and that's very important for what follows. Wealth concentration is always a lot higher than income concentration. Fact number two is that the rise in wealth inequality in recent decades is still not enough to get us back to     . So the big difference today  wealth inequality is still very large  with        percent of total wealth for the top     but the good news is that it's actually better than one century ago  where you had    percent in Europe going to the top   . So today what you have is what I call the middle    percent  the people who are not in the top    and who are not in the bottom     and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns    to    percent of total wealth  national wealth  whereas they used to be poor  a century ago  when there was basically no wealth middle class. So this is an important change  and it's interesting to see that wealth inequality has not fully recovered to pre World War I levels  although the total quantity of wealth has recovered. Okay  So this is the total value of wealth relative to income  and you can see that in particular in Europe  we are almost back to the pre World War I level. So there are really two different parts of the story here. One has to do with the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate  and there is nothing bad per se  of course  in accumulating a lot of wealth  and in particular if it is more diffuse and less concentrated. So what we really want to focus on is the long run evolution of wealth inequality  and what's going to happen in the future. How can we account for the fact that until World War I  wealth inequality was so high and  if anything  was rising to even higher levels  and how can we think about the future  So let me come to some of the explanations and speculations about the future. Let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much more concentrated than income is a dynamic  dynastic model where individuals have a long horizon and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons. If people were accumulating wealth only for life cycle reasons  you know  to be able to consume when they are old  then the level of wealth inequality should be more or less in line with the level of income inequality. But it will be very difficult to explain why you have so much more wealth inequality than income inequality with a pure life cycle model  so you need a story where people also care about wealth accumulation for other reasons. So typically  they want to transmit wealth to the next generation  to their children  or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth because of the prestige  the power that goes with wealth. So there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the data. Now  in a large class of dynamic models of wealth accumulation with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth  you will have all sorts of random  multiplicative shocks. So for instance  some families have a very large number of children  so the wealth will be divided. Some families have fewer children. You also have shocks to rates of return. Some families make huge capital gains. Some made bad investments. So you will always have some mobility in the wealth process. Some people will move up  some people will move down. The important point is that  in any such model  for a given variance of such shocks  the equilibrium level of wealth inequality will be a steeply rising function of r minus g. And intuitively  the reason why the difference between the rate of return to wealth and the growth rate is important is that initial wealth inequalities will be amplified at a faster pace with a bigger r minus g. So take a simple example  with r equals five percent and g equals one percent  wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size of the economy. So this makes it easier to build and perpetuate large fortunes because you can consume four fifths  assuming zero tax  and you can just reinvest one fifth. So of course some families will consume more than that  some will consume less  so there will be some mobility in the distribution  but on average  they only need to reinvest one fifth  so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained. Now  you should not be surprised by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever  because  in fact  this is what happened during most of the history of mankind. And this was in a way very obvious to everybody for a simple reason  which is that growth was close to zero percent during most of the history of mankind. Growth was maybe  .    .    .  percent  but very slow growth of population and output per capita  whereas the rate of return on capital of course was not zero percent. It was  for land assets  which was the traditional form of assets in preindustrial societies  it was typically five percent. Any reader of Jane Austen would know that. If you want an annual income of       pounds  you should have a capital value of        pounds so that five percent of        is      . And in a way  this was the very foundation of society  because r bigger than g was what allowed holders of wealth and assets to live off their capital income and to do something else in life than just to care about their own survival. Now  one important conclusion of my historical research is that modern industrial growth did not change this basic fact as much as one might have expected. Of course  the growth rate following the Industrial Revolution rose  typically from zero to one to two percent  but at the same time  the rate of return to capital also rose so that the gap between the two did not really change. So during the   th century  you had a very unique combination of events. First  a very low rate of return due to the      and      war shocks  destruction of wealth  inflation  bankruptcy during the Great Depression  and all of this reduced the private rate of return to wealth to unusually low levels between      and     . And then  in the postwar period  you had unusually high growth rate  partly due to the reconstruction. You know  in Germany  in France  in Japan  you had five percent growth rate between      and      largely due to reconstruction  and also due to very large demographic growth  the Baby Boom Cohort effect. Now  apparently that's not going to last for very long  or at least the population growth is supposed to decline in the future  and the best projections we have is that the long run growth is going to be closer to one to two percent rather than four to five percent. So if you look at this  these are the best estimates we have of world GDP growth and rate of return on capital  average rates of return on capital  so you can see that during most of the history of mankind  the growth rate was very small  much lower than the rate of return  and then during the   th century  it is really the population growth  very high in the postwar period  and the reconstruction process that brought growth to a smaller gap with the rate of return. Here I use the United Nations population projections  so of course they are uncertain. It could be that we all start having a lot of children in the future  and the growth rates are going to be higher  but from now on  these are the best projections we have  and this will make global growth decline and the gap between the rate of return go up. Now  the other unusual event during the   th century was  as I said  destruction  taxation of capital  so this is the pre tax rate of return. This is the after tax rate of return  and after destruction  and this is what brought the average rate of return after tax  after destruction  below the growth rate during a long time period. But without the destruction  without the taxation  this  would not have happened. So let me say that the balance between returns on capital and growth depends on many different factors that are very difficult to predict  technology and the development of capital intensive techniques. So right now  the most capital intensive sectors in the economy are the real estate sector  housing  the energy sector  but it could be in the future that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors and that this would be a bigger share of the total capital stock that it is today. Well  we are very far from this  and from now  what's going on in the real estate sector  the energy sector  is much more important for the total capital stock and capital share. The other important issue is that there are scale effects in portfolio management  together with financial complexity  financial deregulation  that make it easier to get higher rates of return for a large portfolio  and this seems to be particularly strong for billionaires  large capital endowments. Just to give you one example  this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings over the           period  and you can see the very top wealth holders have been going up at six  seven percent per year in real terms above inflation  whereas average income in the world  average wealth in the world  have increased at only two percent per year. And you find the same for large university endowments   the bigger the initial endowments  the bigger the rate of return. Now  what could be done  The first thing is that I think we need more financial transparency. We know too little about global wealth dynamics  so we need international transmission of bank information. We need a global registry of financial assets  more coordination on wealth taxation  and even wealth tax with a small tax rate will be a way to produce information so that then we can adapt our policies to whatever we observe. And to some extent  the fight against tax havens and automatic transmission of information is pushing us in this direction. Now  there are other ways to redistribute wealth  which it can be tempting to use. Inflation  it's much easier to print money than to write a tax code  so that's very tempting  but sometimes you don't know what you do with the money. This is a problem. Expropriation is very tempting. Just when you feel some people get too wealthy  you just expropriate them. But this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics. So war is an even less efficient way  so I tend to prefer progressive taxation  but of course  history    Laughter    history will invent its own best ways  and it will probably involve a combination of all of these. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thomas Piketty. Thank you. Thomas  I want to ask you two or three questions  because it's impressive how you're in command of your data  of course  but basically what you suggest is growing wealth concentration is kind of a natural tendency of capitalism  and if we leave it to its own devices  it may threaten the system itself  so you're suggesting that we need to act to implement policies that redistribute wealth  including the ones we just saw  progressive taxation  etc. In the current political context  how realistic are those  How likely do you think that it is that they will be implemented  Thomas Piketty  Well  you know  I think if you look back through time  the history of income  wealth and taxation is full of surprise. So I am not terribly impressed by those who know in advance what will or will not happen. I think one century ago  many people would have said that progressive income taxation would never happen and then it happened. And even five years ago  many people would have said that bank secrecy will be with us forever in Switzerland  that Switzerland was too powerful for the rest of the world  and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions against Swiss banks for a big change to happen  and now we are moving toward more financial transparency. So I think it's not that difficult to better coordinate politically. We are going to have a treaty with half of the world GDP around the table with the U.S. and the European Union  so if half of the world GDP is not enough to make progress on financial transparency and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits  what does it take  So I think these are not technical difficulties. I think we can make progress if we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions and we have the proper sanctions on those who benefit from financial opacity. BG  One of the arguments against your point of view is that economic inequality is not only a feature of capitalism but is actually one of its engines. So we take measures to lower inequality  and at the same time we lower growth  potentially. What do you answer to that  TP  Yeah  I think inequality is not a problem per se. I think inequality up to a point can actually be useful for innovation and growth. The problem is  it's a question of degree. When inequality gets too extreme  then it becomes useless for growth and it can even become bad because it tends to lead to high perpetuation of inequality over time and low mobility. And for instance  the kind of wealth concentrations that we had in the   th century and pretty much until World War I in every European country was  I think  not useful for growth. This was destroyed by a combination of tragic events and policy changes  and this did not prevent growth from happening. And also  extreme inequality can be bad for our democratic institutions if it creates very unequal access to political voice  and the influence of private money in U.S. politics  I think  is a matter of concern right now. So we don't want to return to that kind of extreme  pre World War I inequality. Having a decent share of the national wealth for the middle class is not bad for growth. It is actually useful both for equity and efficiency reasons. BG  I said at the beginning that your book has been criticized. Some of your data has been criticized. Some of your choice of data sets has been criticized. You have been accused of cherry picking data to make your case. What do you answer to that  TP  Well  I answer that I am very happy that this book is stimulating debate. This is part of what it is intended for. Look  the reason why I put all the data online with all of the detailed computation is so that we can have  an open and transparent debate about this. So I have responded point by point to every concern. Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today  I would actually conclude that the rise in wealth inequality  particularly in the United States  has been actually higher than what I report in my book. There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman showing  with new data which I didn't have at the time of the book  that wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen even more than what I report. And there will be other data in the future. Some of it will go in different directions. Look  we put online almost every week new  updated series on the World Top Income Database and we will keep doing so in the future  in particular in emerging countries  and I welcome all of those who want to contribute to this data collection process. In fact  I certainly agree that there is not enough transparency about wealth dynamics  and a good way to have better data would be to have a wealth tax with a small tax rate to begin with so that we can all agree about this important evolution and adapt our policies to whatever we observe. So taxation is a source of knowledge  and that's what we need the most right now. BG  Thomas Piketty  merci beaucoup. Thank you. TP  Thank you.  Applause  This is my niece  Stella. She's just turned one and started to walk. And she's walking in that really cool way that one year olds do  a kind of teetering  my body's moving  too fast for my legs kind of way. It is absolutely gorgeous. And one of her favorite  things to do at the moment is to stare at herself in the mirror. She absolutely loves her reflection. She giggles and squeals  and gives herself these big  wet kisses. It is beautiful. Apparently  all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this  and it got me thinking  When did I stop doing this  When is it suddenly not okay to love  the way that we look  Because apparently we don't. Ten thousand people every month google   Am I ugly   This is Faye. Faye is    and she  lives in Denver. And like any teenager  she just wants to  be liked and to fit in. It's Sunday night. She's getting ready for the week ahead at school. And she's slightly dreading it  and  she's a bit confused because despite her mom telling her all the time that she's beautiful  every day at school  someone tells her  that she's ugly. Because of the difference between what her mom  tells her and what her friends at school  or her peers at school are telling her  she doesn't know who to believe. So  she takes a video of herself.  She posts it to YouTube and she asks people to please leave  a comment   Am I pretty or am I ugly   Well  so far  Faye has received  over        comments. Some of them are so nasty  they don't  bear thinking about. This is an average  healthy looking  teenage girl receiving this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life. Thousands of people are posting videos like this  mostly teenage girls  reaching out in this way. But what's leading them to do this  Well  today's teenagers are rarely alone. They're under pressure to be online and available at all times  talking  messaging  liking  commenting   sharing  posting   it never ends. Never before have we been so connected  so continuously  so instantaneously  so young. And as one mom told me  it's like there's a party in their bedroom every night. There's simply no privacy. And the social pressures that go along  with that are relentless. This always on environment is training our kids to value themselves based on the number of likes they get and the types of comments that they receive. There's no separation between online and offline life. What's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference between. And it's also really hard to tell the difference  between what's authentic and what's digitally manipulated. What's a highlight in someone's life versus what's normal in the context of everyday. And where are they looking to for inspiration  Well  you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds of girls today. Size zero models still dominate our catwalks. Airbrushing is now routine. And trends like  thinspiration   thighgap   bikinibridge and  proana. For those who don't know   proana means pro anorexia. These trends are teamed with the  stereotyping and flagrant objectification of women in today's popular culture. It is not hard to see what girls are benchmarking themselves against. But boys are not immune to this either. Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of superhero like sports stars and playboy music artists. But  what's the problem with all of this  Well  surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy   well balanced individuals. But in an image obsessed culture  we are training our kids to spend more time and mental effort on  their appearance at the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities. So  things like their relationships  the development of their physical abilities  and their studies and so on begin to suffer. Six out of    girls are now choosing not to do  something because they don't think they look good enough. These are not trivial activities. These are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contributors to society and to  the workforce. Thirty one percent  nearly one in  three teenagers  are withdrawing from classroom debate. They're failing to engage in classroom debate because they don't want to draw attention to the  way that they look. One in five are not showing up to class at all on days when they don't feel good about it. And when it comes to exams  if you don't think you look good enough  specifically if you don't think you are thin enough  you will score a lower grade point average than your peers who are not concerned with this. And this is consistent across Finland  the U.S. and China  and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh. So to be super clear  we're talking about the way you think you look  not how you actually look. Low body confidence is undermining  academic achievement. But it's also damaging health. Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity  eat less fruits and vegetables  partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders. They have lower self esteem. They're more easily influenced by people around them and they're at greater risk of depression. And we think it's for all of these reasons that they take more risks with things like alcohol and drug use  crash dieting  cosmetic surgery   unprotected  earlier sex  and self harm. The pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems and costing our governments billions of  dollars every year. And we don't grow out of it. Women who think they're overweight   again  regardless of whether they are or are not   have higher rates of absenteeism. Seventeen percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they weren't feeling confident about the way that they look. Have a think about what this is doing to our economy. If we could overcome this  what that opportunity looks like. Unlocking this potential is in the interest of every single one of us. But how do we do that  Well  talking  on its own  only gets you so far. It's not enough by itself. If you actually want to make a difference  you have to do something. And we've learned there are three key ways  The first is we have to educate for body confidence. We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome image related pressures and build their self esteem. Now  the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this. The bad news is that most of them don't work. I was shocked to learn that many well meaning programs are inadvertently actually making the situation worse. So we need to make damn sure that the programs that our kids are receiving are not only having a positive impact  but having a lasting impact as well. And the research shows  that the best programs address six key areas  The first is the influence of family   friends and relationships. The second is media and celebrity culture  then how to handle teasing and bullying  the way we compete and compare with one another based on looks  talking about appearance   some people call this  body talk  or  fat talk    and finally  the foundations of respecting and looking after yourself. These six things are crucial starting points for anyone serious about delivering body confidence education that works. An education is critical  but tackling this problem is going to require each and everyone of us to step up and be better role models for the women and girls in our own lives. Challenging the status quo of how women are seen and talked about in our own circles. It is not okay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their haircuts or the size of their breasts  or to infer that the determination or the success of an Olympian is down  to her not being a looker. We need to start judging people by what they do  not what they look like. We can all start by taking responsibility  for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks. We can compliment people based on  their effort and their actions and not on their appearance. And let me ask you  when was the last time that you kissed a mirror  Ultimately  we need to work together as communities  as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours so that our kids grow up valuing their  whole selves  valuing individuality  diversity  inclusion. We need to put the people that are making a real difference on our pedestals  making a difference in the real world. Giving them the airtime  because only then will we create a different world. A world where our kids are free to become the best versions of themselves  where the way they think they look never holds them back from being who they are or achieving what they want in life. Think about what this might mean  for someone in your life. Who have you got in mind  Is it your wife  Your sister  Your daughter  Your niece  Your friend  It could just be the woman  a couple of seats away from you today. What would it mean for her if she were freed from that voice of her inner critic  nagging her to have longer legs  thinner thighs  smaller stomach  shorter feet  What could it mean for her if we overcame this and unlocked her potential in that way  Right now  our culture's obsession with image is holding us all back. But let's show our kids the truth. Let's show them that the way you look is just one part of your identity and that the truth is we love them for who they are and what they do and how they make us feel. Let's build self esteem into our school curriculums. Let's each and every one of us change the way we talk and compare ourselves to other people. And let's work together as communities  from grassroots to governments  so that the happy little one year olds of today become the confident changemakers of tomorrow. Let's do this. I have the feeling that we can all agree that we're moving towards a new model of the state and society. But  we're absolutely clueless as to what this is or what it should be. It seems like we need to have a conversation about democracy in our day and age. Let's think about it this way  We are   st century citizens  doing our very  very best to interact with   th century designed institutions that are based on an information technology of the   th century. Let's have a look at some of the characteristics of this system. First of all  it's designed for an information technology that's over     years old. And the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many. And the many get to vote once every  couple of years. In the second place  the costs of participating in this system are incredibly high. You either have to have a fair  bit of money and influence  or you have to devote your entire life to politics. You have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe  one day  you'll get  to sit at a table where a decision is being made. And last but not least  the language of the system   it's incredibly cryptic. It's done for lawyers  by lawyers  and no one else can understand. So  it's a system where we can choose our authorities  but we are completely left out on how those authorities reach their decisions. So  in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation  our barriers of information are completely lowered and we can  more than ever before  express our desires and our concerns. Our political system remains the same for the past     years and expects us to be contented with being  simply passive recipients of a monologue. So  it's really not surprising that this kind of system is only able to produce two kinds of results  silence or noise. Silence  in terms of citizens not engaging  simply not wanting to participate. There's this commonplace   idea  that I truly  truly dislike  and it's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic. That we shun commitment. But  can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend  physically  a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever  Conflict is bound to happen between a system that no longer represents  nor has any dialogue capacity  and citizens that are increasingly used to representing themselves. And  then we find noise  Chile  Argentina  Brazil  Mexico Italy  France  Spain  the United States  they're all democracies. Their citizens have access to the ballot boxes. But they still feel the need  they need to take to the streets in order  to be heard. To me  it seems like the   th century slogan that was the basis for the formation of our modern democracies   No taxation without representation   can now be updated to  No representation without a conversation.  We want our seat at the table. And rightly so. But in order to be part of this conversation  we need to know what we want to do next  because political action is being able to move from agitation to construction. My generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests  protests that were able to successfully impose agendas  roll back extremely pernicious legislation  and even overthrow authoritarian governments. And we should be immensely proud of this. But  we also must admit that we haven't been good at using those same networks and technologies to successfully articulate an alternative to what we're seeing and find the consensus and build  the alliances that are needed to make it happen. And so the risk that we face is that we can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers  like the military or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes. But our democracy is neither just a matter of voting once every couple of years. But it's not either the ability to bring millions onto the streets. So the question I'd like to raise here  and I do believe it's the most important  question we need to answer  is this one  If Internet is the new printing press  then what is democracy for the Internet era  What institutions do we want to build for the   st century society  I don't have the answer  just in case. I don't think anyone does. But I truly believe we can't afford to ignore this question anymore. So  I'd like to share our experience and what we've learned so far and hopefully contribute two cents to this conversation. Two years ago  with a group of friends from Argentina  we started thinking   how can  we get our representatives  our elected representatives  to represent us   Marshall McLuhan once said that politics is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools. So the question that motivated us was  can we try and solve some of today's problems with the tools that we use every single day of our lives  Our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called DemocracyOS. DemocracyOS is an open source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives to make it easier for us to participate  from our everyday lives. So first of all  you can get informed so every new project that gets introduced in Congress gets immediately translated and explained in plain language on this platform. But we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information  but from doing something with it. So better access to information should lead to a conversation about what we're going to do next  and DemocracyOS allows for that. Because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences  one on top of each other  but that our healthy and robust public debate should be  once again  one of its fundamental values. So DemocracyOS is about persuading  and being persuaded. It's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement. And finally  you can vote how you would like your elected  representative to vote. And if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue  you can always delegate your vote to someone else  allowing for a dynamic and emerging social leadership. It suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in Congress. But  it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick. What we needed to do to was to find actors that were able to grab this distributed knowledge in society and use it to make better and more fair decisions. So we reached out to traditional political parties and we offered them DemocracyOS. We said   Look  here you have a platform that you can use to build a two way conversation with your constituencies.  And yes  we failed. We failed big time. We were sent to play  outside like little kids. Amongst other things  we were called naive. And I must be honest  I think  in hindsight  we were. Because the challenges that we face  they're not technological  they're cultural. Political parties were never willing to change the way they make their decisions. So it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea  we needed to do it ourselves. And so we took quite a leap of faith  and in August last year  we founded our own political party  El Partido de la Red  or the Net Party  in the city of  Buenos Aires. And taking an even bigger leap of faith  we ran for elections in October last year with this idea  if we want a seat in Congress  our candidate  our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on DemocracyOS. Every single project that got introduced in Congress  we were going vote according to what citizens decided on an online platform. It was our way of hacking the political system. We understood that if we wanted to become part of the conversation  to have a seat at the table  we needed to become valid stakeholders  and the only way of doing it is to play by the  system rules. But we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions. For the first time  we were making our decisions together with those who we were affecting directly by those decisions. It was a very  very bold move for a two month old party in the city of Buenos Aires. But it got attention. We got        votes  that's  .  percent of the votes  and we came in second for the local options. So  even if that wasn't enough to win a seat in Congress  it was enough for us to become part of the conversation  to the extent that next month  Congress  as an institution  is launching for the first time in Argentina's history  a DemocracyOS to discuss  with the citizens  three pieces of legislation  two on urban transportation and one on the use of public space. Of course  our elected representatives are not saying   Yes  we're going to vote according to what citizens decide   but they're willing to try. They're willing to open up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they'll be willing to listen as well. Our political system can be transformed  and not by subverting it  by destroying it  but by rewiring it with the tools that Internet affords us now. But a real challenge is to find  to design to create  to empower those connectors that are able to innovate  to transform noise and silence into signal and finally bring our democracies to the   st century. I'm not saying it's easy. But in our experience  we actually stand a chance of making it work. And in my heart  it's most definitely worth trying. Thank you. I live in Washington  D.C.  but I grew up in Sindhekela  a village in Orissa  in India. My father was a government worker. My mother could not read or write  but she would say to me   A king is  worshipped only in his own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere.  So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up. But I almost didn't go to college until an aunt offered financial help. I went to study in Sambalpur  the largest town in the region  where  already in college  I saw a television for the first time. I had dreams of going to the United States for higher studies. When the opportunity came  I crossed two oceans  with borrowed money for airfare and only a     bill in my pocket. In the U.S.  I worked in a research center  part time  while taking graduate classes in economics. And with the little I earned  I would finance myself and then I would send money home to my brother and my father. My story is not unique. There are millions of people who migrate each year. With the help of the family  they cross oceans  they cross deserts  they cross  rivers  they cross mountains. They risk their lives to realize a dream  and that dream is as simple as having a decent job somewhere so they can send money home and help the family  which has helped them before. There are     million international  migrants in the world. These are people who live in a country other than their country of birth. If there was a country made up of only international migrants  that would be larger  in population  than Brazil. That would be larger  in its size of the economy  than France. Some     million of them  from poor countries  send money home regularly. Those sums of money are called remittances. Here is a fact that might surprise you      billion dollars      billion dollars was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries. Migrants from developing countries  money sent to developing countries       billion dollars. That's a remarkable number because that is three times the size of the total of development aid money. And yet  you and I  my colleagues in Washington  we endlessly debate and discuss about development aid  while we ignore remittances as small change. True  people send     dollars per month  on average. But  repeated month after month  by millions of people  these sums of money add up to rivers  of foreign currency. So India  last year  received     billion dollars  larger than its IT exports. In Egypt remittances are three times the size of revenues from the Suez Canal. In Tajikistan  remittances are    percent of GDP. And in poorer countries  smaller  countries  fragile countries  conflict afflicted countries  remittances are a lifeline  as in Somalia or in Haiti. No wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people. Remittances  unlike private investment money  they don't flow back at the first sign of trouble in the country. They actually act like an insurance. When the family is in trouble  facing hardship  facing hard times  remittances increase  they act like an insurance. Migrants send more money then. Unlike development aid money  that must go through official agencies  through governments  remittances directly reach the poor  reach the family  and often with business advice. So in Nepal  the share of poor people was    percent in       the share of poor people in the population. By       a decade later  at a time of political crisis  economic crisis  the share of poor people went down to    percent. That decline in poverty  most of it  about half of it  is believed to be because of remittances from India  another poor country. In El Salvador  the school dropout rate among children is lower in families that receive remittances. In Mexico and Sri Lanka  the birth weight of children is higher among families that receive remittances. Remittances are dollars wrapped with care. Migrants send money home for food  for buying necessities  for building houses  for funding education  for funding healthcare for the elderly  for business investments for friends and family. Migrants send even more money home for special occasions like a surgery or a wedding. And migrants also send money  perhaps far too many times  for unexpected funerals that they cannot attend. Much as these flows do all that good  there are barriers to these flows of remittances  these     billion dollars of remittances. Foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home. Money transfer companies structure their fees to milk the poor. They will say   Up to     dollars if you want to send  we will charge you    dollars fixed.  If you are poor and if you have  only     dollars to send  you have to pay that     fee. The global average cost of sending money is eight percent. That means you send     dollars  the family on the other side receives only    dollars. To send money to Africa  the cost is even higher     percent. To send money within Africa  the cost is even higher  over    percent. For example  sending money from Benin  to Nigeria. And then there is the case of Venezuela  where  because of exchange controls  you send     dollars and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives even    dollars. Of course  nobody sends money to Venezuela through the official channel. It all goes in suitcases. Whereever costs are high  money goes underground. And what is worse  many developing countries actually have a blanket ban on sending money out of the country. Many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money  to specific countries. So  is it that there are no options  no better options  cheaper options  to send money  There are. M Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money and receive money at a fixed cost of only    cents per transaction. U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico to enable money service businesses to send money to Mexico for a fixed cost of only    cents per transaction. And yet  these faster  cheaper  better options can't be applied internationally because of the fear of money laundering  even though there is little data to support any connection  any significant connection between money laundering and these small remittance transactions. Many international banks now are wary of hosting bank accounts of money service businesses  especially those serving Somalia. Somalia  a country where the per capita income is only     dollars per year. Monthly remittances  on average  to Somalia is larger than that amount. Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia. And yet  this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid  while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood to that economy  through regulations. Then there is the case of poor people from villages  like me. In the villages  the only place where you can get money is through the post office. Most of the governments in the world have allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies. So  if I have to send money to my father in the village  I must send money through that particular money transfer company  even if the cost is high. I cannot go to a cheaper option. This has to go. So  what can international organizations and social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost of sending money home  First  relax regulations on small remittances under       dollars. Governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering. Second  governments should abolish exclusive partnerships between their post office and the money  transfer company. For that matter  between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor. In fact  they should promote competition  open up the partnership so that we will bring down costs like we did  like they did  in the telecommunications industry. You have seen what has happened there. Third  large nonprofit philanthropic organizations should create a remittance platform on a nonprofit basis. They should create a nonprofit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies so that they can send money at a low cost  while complying with all the complex regulations all over the world. The development community should set a goal of reducing remittance costs to one percent from the current eight percent. If we reduce costs to one percent  that would release a saving of     billion dollars per year. Thirty billion dollars  that's  larger than the entire bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year. That is larger than  or almost similar to  the total aid budget of the United States government  the largest donor on the planet. Actually  the savings would be larger than that    billion because remittance channels are also used for aid  trade and investment purposes. Another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment  fees that migrants pay  migrant workers pay to laborers who found them the job. I was in Dubai a few years ago. I visited a camp for workers. It was   in the evening  dark  hot  humid. Workers were coming back from their grueling day of work  and I struck a conversation with a Bangladeshi construction worker. He was preoccupied that he is sending money home  he has been sending money home for a few months now  and the money is mostly going to the recruitment agent  to the labor agent who found him that job. And in my mind  I could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance. The remittance arrives. She takes the money and hands it over to the recruitment agent  while the children are looking on. This has to stop. It is not only construction  workers from Bangladesh  it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem. A construction worker from Bangladesh  on an average  pays about        dollars in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only        dollars per year in income. That means that for the two years or three years of his life  he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees. The family doesn't get to see any of it. It is not only Dubai  it is the dark underbelly of every major city in the world. It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers  it is workers from all over the world. It is not only men. Women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices. One of the most exciting and newest thing happening in the area of remittances is how to mobilize  through innovation  diaspora saving and diaspora giving. Migrants send money home  but they also save a large amount of money where they live. Annually  migrant savings are estimated to be     billion dollars. Most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate. If a country were to come  and offer a three percent or four percent interest rate  and then say that the money would be used for building schools  roads  airports  train systems in the country of origin  a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money because it's not only financial gains that give them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country's development. Remittance channels can be used to sell these bonds to migrants because when they come on a monthly basis to send remittances  that's when you can actually sell it to them. You can also do the same for mobilizing diaspora giving. I would love to invest in a bullet train system in India and I would love to contribute to efforts to fight malaria in my village. Remittances are a great way of sharing prosperity between places in a targeted way that benefits those who need them most. Remittances empower people. We must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper. And it can be done. As for myself  I have been away from India for two decades now. My wife is a Venezuelan. My children are Americans. Increasingly  I feel like a global citizen. And yet  I am growing nostalgic about my country of birth. I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time. My parents are not there anymore. My brothers and sisters have moved on. There is no real urgency for me to send money home. And yet  from time to time  I send money home to friends  to relatives  to the village  to be there  to stay engaged   that's part of my identity. And  I'm still striving to be a poet for the hardworking migrants and their struggle to break free of the cycle of poverty. Thank you. There is an entire genre of YouTube videos devoted to an experience which I am certain that everyone in this room has had. It entails an individual who  thinking they're alone  engages in some expressive behavior   wild singing  gyrating dancing  some mild sexual activity   only to discover that  in fact  they are not alone  that there is a person watching and lurking  the discovery of which causes them to immediately cease what they were doing in horror. The sense of shame and humiliation in their face is palpable. It's the sense of   This is something I'm willing to do only if no one else is watching.  This is the crux of the work on which I have been singularly focused for the last    months  the question of why privacy matters  a question that has arisen in the context of a global debate  enabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden that the United States and its partners  unbeknownst to the entire world  has converted the Internet  once heralded as an unprecedented tool of liberation and democratization  into an unprecedented zone of mass  indiscriminate surveillance. There is a very common sentiment that arises in this debate  even among people who are uncomfortable with mass surveillance  which says that there is no real harm that comes from this large scale invasion because only people who are engaged in bad acts have a reason to want to hide and to care about their privacy. This worldview is implicitly grounded in the proposition that there are two kinds of people in the world  good people and bad people. Bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks or who engage in violent criminality and therefore have reasons to want to hide what they're doing  have reasons to care about their privacy. But by contrast  good people are people who go to work  come home  raise their children  watch television. They use the Internet not to plot bombing attacks but to read the news or exchange recipes or to plan their kids' Little League games  and those people are doing nothing wrong and therefore have nothing to hide and no reason to fear the government monitoring them. The people who are actually saying that are engaged in a very extreme act of self deprecation. What they're really saying is   I have agreed to make myself such a harmless and unthreatening and uninteresting person that I actually don't fear having the government know what it is that I'm doing.  This mindset has found what I think is its purest expression in a      interview with the longtime CEO of Google  Eric Schmidt  who  when asked about all the different ways his company is causing invasions of privacy for hundreds of millions of people around the world  said this  He said   If you're doing something that you don't want other people to know  maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.  Now  there's all kinds of things to say about that mentality  the first of which is that the people who say that  who say that privacy isn't really important  they don't actually believe it  and the way you know that they don't actually believe it is that while they say with their words that privacy doesn't matter  with their actions  they take all kinds of steps to safeguard their privacy. They put passwords on their email and their social media accounts  they put locks on their bedroom and bathroom doors  all steps designed to prevent other people from entering what they consider their private realm and knowing what it is that they don't want other people to know. The very same Eric Schmidt  the CEO of Google  ordered his employees at Google to cease speaking with the online Internet magazine CNET after CNET published an article full of personal  private information about Eric Schmidt  which it obtained exclusively through Google searches and using other Google products.  Laughter  This same division can be seen with the CEO of Facebook  Mark Zuckerberg  who in an infamous interview in      pronounced that privacy is no longer a  social norm.  Last year  Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife purchased not only their own house but also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto for a total of    million dollars in order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy that prevented other people from monitoring what they do in their personal lives. Over the last    months  as I've debated this issue around the world  every single time somebody has said to me   I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide.  I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen  I write down my email address. I say   Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts  not just the nice  respectable work one in your name  but all of them  because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online  read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all  if you're not a bad person  if you're doing nothing wrong  you should have nothing to hide.  Not a single person has taken me up on that offer. I check and    Applause  I check that email account religiously all the time. It's a very desolate place. And there's a reason for that  which is that we as human beings  even those of us who in words disclaim the importance of our own privacy  instinctively understand the profound importance of it. It is true that as human beings  we're social animals  which means we have a need for other people to know what we're doing and saying and thinking  which is why we voluntarily publish information about ourselves online. But equally essential to what it means to be a free and fulfilled human being is to have a place that we can go and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people. There's a reason why we seek that out  and our reason is that all of us   not just terrorists and criminals  all of us   have things to hide. There are all sorts of things that we do and think that we're willing to tell our physician or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse or our best friend that we would be mortified for the rest of the world to learn. We make judgments every single day about the kinds of things that we say and think and do that we're willing to have other people know  and the kinds of things that we say and think and do that we don't want anyone else to know about. People can very easily in words claim that they don't value their privacy  but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief. Now  there's a reason why privacy is so craved universally and instinctively. It isn't just a reflexive movement like breathing air or drinking water. The reason is that when we're in a state where we can be monitored  where we can be watched  our behavior changes dramatically. The range of behavioral options that we consider when we think we're being watched severely reduce. This is just a fact of human nature that has been recognized in social science and in literature and in religion and in virtually every field of discipline. There are dozens of psychological studies that prove that when somebody knows that they might be watched  the behavior they engage in is vastly more conformist and compliant. Human shame is a very powerful motivator  as is the desire to avoid it  and that's the reason why people  when they're in a state of being watched  make decisions not that are the byproduct of their own agency but that are about the expectations that others have of them or the mandates of societal orthodoxy. This realization was exploited most powerfully for pragmatic ends by the   th  century philosopher Jeremy Bentham  who set out to resolve an important problem ushered in by the industrial age  where  for the first time  institutions had become so large and centralized that they were no longer able to monitor and therefore control each one of their individual members  and the solution that he devised was an architectural design originally intended to be implemented in prisons that he called the panopticon  the primary attribute of which was the construction of an enormous tower in the center of the institution where whoever controlled the institution could at any moment watch any of the inmates  although they couldn't watch all of them at all times. And crucial to this design was that the inmates could not actually see into the panopticon  into the tower  and so they never knew if they were being watched or even when. And what made him so excited about this discovery was that that would mean that the prisoners would have to assume that they were being watched at any given moment  which would be the ultimate enforcer for obedience and compliance. The   th century French philosopher Michel Foucault realized that that model could be used not just for prisons but for every institution that seeks to control human behavior  schools  hospitals  factories  workplaces. And what he said was that this mindset  this framework discovered by Bentham  was the key means of societal control for modern  Western societies  which no longer need the overt weapons of tyranny   punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents  or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party   because mass surveillance creates a prison in the mind that is a much more subtle though much more effective means of fostering compliance with social norms or with social orthodoxy  much more effective than brute force could ever be. The most iconic work of literature about surveillance and privacy is the George Orwell novel         which we all learn in school  and therefore it's almost become a cliche. In fact  whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance  people instantaneously dismiss it as inapplicable  and what they say is   Oh  well in '     ' there were monitors in people's homes  they were being watched at every given moment  and that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face.  That is an actual fundamental misapprehension of the warnings that Orwell issued in      .  The warning that he was issuing was about a surveillance state not that monitored everybody at all times  but where people were aware that they could be monitored at any given moment. Here is how Orwell's narrator  Winston Smith  described the surveillance system that they faced   There was  of course  no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment.  He went on to say   At any rate  they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live  did live  from habit that became instinct  in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized.  The Abrahamic religions similarly posit that there's an invisible  all knowing authority who  because of its omniscience  always watches whatever you're doing  which means you never have a private moment  the ultimate enforcer for obedience to its dictates. What all of these seemingly disparate works recognize  the conclusion that they all reach  is that a society in which people can be monitored at all times is a society that breeds conformity and obedience and submission  which is why every tyrant  the most overt to the most subtle  craves that system. Conversely  even more importantly  it is a realm of privacy  the ability to go somewhere where we can think and reason and interact and speak without the judgmental eyes of others being cast upon us  in which creativity and exploration and dissent exclusively reside  and that is the reason why  when we allow a society to exist in which we're subject to constant monitoring  we allow the essence of human freedom to be severely crippled. The last point I want to observe about this mindset  the idea that only people who  are doing something wrong have things to hide and therefore reasons to care about privacy  is that it entrenches two very destructive messages  two destructive lessons  the first of which is that the only people who care about privacy  the only people who will seek out privacy  are by definition bad people. This is a conclusion that we should have all kinds of reasons for avoiding  the most important of which is that when you say   somebody who is doing bad things   you probably mean things like plotting a terrorist attack or engaging in violent criminality  a much narrower conception of what people who wield power mean when they say   doing bad things.  For them   doing bad things  typically means doing something that poses meaningful challenges to the exercise of our own power. The other really destructive and  I think  even more insidious lesson that comes from accepting this mindset is there's an implicit bargain that people who accept this mindset have accepted  and that bargain is this  If you're willing to render yourself sufficiently harmless  sufficiently unthreatening to those who wield political power  then and only then can you be free of the dangers of surveillance. It's only those who are dissidents  who challenge power  who have something to worry about. There are all kinds of reasons why we should want to avoid that lesson as well. You may be a person who  right now  doesn't want to engage in that behavior  but at some point in the future you might. Even if you're somebody who decides that you never want to  the fact that there are other people who are willing to and able to resist and be adversarial to those in power   dissidents and journalists and activists and a whole range of others   is something that brings us all collective good that we should want to preserve. Equally critical is that the measure of how free a society is is not how it treats its good  obedient  compliant citizens  but how it treats its dissidents and those who resist orthodoxy. But the most important reason is that a system of mass surveillance suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways. It renders off limits all kinds of behavioral choices without our even knowing that it's happened. The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg once said   He who does not move does not notice his chains.  We can try and render the chains of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable  but the constraints that it imposes on us do not become any less potent. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Glenn  thank you. The case is rather convincing  I have to say  but I want to bring you back to the last    months and to Edward Snowden for a few questions  if you don't mind. The first one is personal to you. We have all read about the arrest of your partner  David Miranda in London  and other difficulties  but I assume that in terms of personal engagement and risk  that the pressure on you is not that easy to take on the biggest sovereign  organizations in the world. Tell us a little bit about that. Glenn Greenwald  You know  I think one of the things that happens is that people's courage in this regard gets contagious  and so although I and the other journalists with whom I was working were certainly aware of the risk   the United States continues to be the most powerful country in the world and doesn't appreciate it when you disclose thousands of their secrets on the Internet at will   seeing somebody who is a    year old ordinary person who grew up in a very ordinary environment exercise the degree of principled courage that Edward Snowden risked  knowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life or that his life would unravel  inspired me and inspired other journalists and inspired  I think  people around the world  including future whistleblowers  to realize that they can engage in that kind of behavior as well. BG  I'm curious about your relationship with Ed Snowden  because you have spoken with him a lot  and you certainly continue doing so  but in your book  you never call him Edward  nor Ed  you say  Snowden.  How come  GG  You know  I'm sure that's something for a team of psychologists to examine.  Laughter  I don't really know. The reason I think that  one of the important objectives that he actually had  one of his  I think  most important tactics  was that he knew that one of the ways to distract attention from the substance of the revelations would be to try and personalize the focus on him  and for that reason  he stayed out of the media. He tried not to ever have his personal life subject to examination  and so I think calling him Snowden is a way of just identifying him as this important historical actor rather than trying to personalize him in a way that might distract attention from the substance. Moderator  So his revelations  your analysis  the work of other journalists  have really developed the debate  and many governments  for example  have reacted  including in Brazil  with projects and programs to reshape a little bit the design of the Internet  etc. There are a lot of things going on in that sense. But I'm wondering  for you personally  what is the endgame  At what point will you think  well  actually  we've succeeded  in moving the dial  GG  Well  I mean  the endgame for me as a journalist is very simple  which is to make sure that every single document that's newsworthy and that ought to be disclosed ends up being disclosed  and that secrets that should never have been kept in the first place end up uncovered. To me  that's the essence of journalism and that's what I'm committed to doing. As somebody who finds mass surveillance odious for all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more  I mean  I look at this as work that will never end until governments around the world are no longer able to subject entire populations to monitoring and surveillance unless they convince some court or some entity that the person they've targeted has actually done something wrong. To me  that's the way that privacy can be rejuvenated. BG  So Snowden is very  as we've seen at TED  is very articulate in presenting and portraying himself as a defender of democratic values and democratic principles. But then  many people really  find it difficult to believe that those are his only motivations. They find it difficult to believe that there was no money involved  that he didn't sell some of those secrets  even to China and to Russia  which are clearly not the best friends of the United States right now. And I'm sure many people in the room are wondering the same question. Do you consider it possible there is that part of Snowden we've not seen yet  GG  No  I consider that absurd and idiotic. and I know you're just playing devil's advocate  but if you wanted to sell secrets to another country  which he could have done and become extremely rich doing so  the last thing you would  do is take those secrets and give them to journalists and ask journalists to publish them  because it makes those secrets worthless. People who want to enrich themselves do it secretly by selling  secrets to the government  but I think there's one important point worth making  which is  that accusation comes from people in the U.S. government  from people in the media who are loyalists to these various governments  and I think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people    Oh  he can't really be doing this for principled reasons  he must have some corrupt  nefarious reason    they're saying a lot more about themselves than they are the target of their accusations  because    Applause    those people  the ones who make that accusation  they themselves never act for any reason other than corrupt reasons  so they assume that everybody else is plagued by the same disease of soullessness as they are  and so that's the assumption. BG  Glenn  thank you very much. GG  Thank you very much. BG  Glenn Greenwald. Sleep. It's something we spend about a third of our lives doing  but do any of us really understand what it's all about  Two thousand years ago  Galen  one of the most prominent medical researchers of the ancient world  proposed that while we're awake  our brain's motive force  its juice  would flow out to all the other parts of the body  animating them but leaving the brain all dried up  and he thought that when we sleep  all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back  rehydrating the brain and refreshing the mind. Now  that sounds completely ridiculous to us now  but Galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that we all deal with every day. See  we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep  it clears your mind  and when you don't sleep  it leaves your mind murky. But while we know a great deal more about sleep now than when Galen was around  we still haven't understood why it is that sleep  of all of our activities  has this incredible restorative function for the mind. So today I want to tell you about some recent research that may shed new light on this question. We've found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution to some of the brain's most basic needs  a unique way that the brain meets the high demands and the narrow margins that set it apart from all the other organs of the body. So almost all the biology that we observe can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions  and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body. In the brain  that is especially critical  its intense electrical activity uses up a quarter of the body's entire energy supply  even though the brain accounts for only about two percent of the body's mass. So the circulatory system solves the nutrient delivery problem by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to every corner of our body. You can actually see it in this video here. Here  we're imaging blood vessels in the brain of a living mouse. The blood vessels form a complex network that fills the entire brain volume. They start at the surface of the brain  and then they dive down into the tissue itself  and as they spread out  they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain. Now  just as every cell requires nutrients to fuel it  every cell also produces waste as a byproduct  and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve. This diagram shows the body's lymphatic system  which has evolved to meet this need. It's a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body. It takes up proteins and other waste from the spaces between the cells  it collects them  and then dumps them into the blood so they can be disposed of. But if you look really closely at this diagram  you'll see something that doesn't make a lot of sense. So if we were to zoom into this guy's head  one of the things that you would see there is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain. But that doesn't make a lot of sense  does it  I mean  the brain is this intensely active organ that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared. And yet  it lacks lymphatic vessels  which means that the approach that the rest of the body takes to clearing away its waste won't work in the brain. So how  then  does the brain solve its waste clearance problem  Well  that seemingly mundane question is where our group first jumped into this story  and what we found as we dove down into the brain  down among the neurons and the blood vessels  was that the brain's solution to the problem of waste clearance  it was really unexpected. It was ingenious  but it was also beautiful. Let me tell you about what we found. So the brain has this large pool of clean  clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid. We call it the CSF. The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain  and wastes from inside the brain make their way out to the CSF  which gets dumped  along with  the waste  into the blood. So in that way  it sounds a lot like the lymphatic system  doesn't it  But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain  they don't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of CSF. Instead  there is a specialized network of plumbing that organizes and facilitates this process. You can see that in these videos. Here  we're again imaging into the brain of living mice. The frame on your left shows what's happening at the brain's surface  and the frame on your right shows what's happening down below the surface of the brain within the tissue itself. We've labeled the blood vessels in red  and the CSF that's surrounding the brain will be in green. Now  what was surprising to us was that the fluid on the outside of the brain  it didn't stay on the outside. Instead  the CSF was pumped back into and through the brain along the outsides of the blood vessels  and as it flushed down into the brain along the outsides of these vessels  it was actually helping to clear away  to clean the waste from the spaces between the brain's cells. If you think about it  using the outsides of these blood vessels like this is a really clever design solution  because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it's packed full of cells  so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system. Yet the blood vessels  they extend from the surface of the brain down to reach every single cell in the brain  which means that fluid that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume  so it's actually this really clever way to repurpose one set of vessels  the blood vessels  to take over and replace the function of a second set of vessels  the lymphatic vessels  to make it so you don't need them. And what's amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells. This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain. But our most surprising finding was that all of this  everything I just told you about  with all this fluid rushing through the brain  it's only happening in the sleeping brain. Here  the video on the left shows how much of the CSF is moving through the brain of a living mouse while it's awake. It's almost nothing. Yet in the same animal  if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep  what we see is that the CSF is rushing through the brain  and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep  the brain cells themselves seem to shrink  opening up spaces in between them  allowing fluid to rush through and allowing waste to be cleared out. So it seems that Galen may actually have been sort of on the right track when he wrote about fluid rushing through the brain when sleep came on. Our own research  now it's       years later  suggests that what's happening is that when the brain is awake and is at its most busy  it puts off clearing away the waste from the spaces between its cells until later  and then  when it goes to sleep and doesn't have to be as busy  it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode to clear away the waste from the spaces between its cells  the waste that's accumulated throughout the day. So it's actually a little bit like how you or I  we put off our household chores during the work week when we don't have time to get to it  and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do when the weekend rolls around. Now  I've just talked a lot about waste clearance  but I haven't been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing during sleep in order to stay healthy. The waste product that these recent studies focused most on is amyloid beta  which is a protein that's made in the brain all the time. My brain's making amyloid beta right now  and so is yours. But in patients with Alzheimer's disease  amyloid beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain's cells  instead of being cleared away  like it's supposed to be  and it's this buildup of amyloid beta that's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease. So we measured how fast amyloid beta is cleared from the brain when it's awake versus when it's asleep  and we found that indeed  the clearance of amyloid beta is much more rapid from the sleeping brain. So if sleep  then  is part of the brain's solution to the problem of waste clearance  then this may dramatically change how we think about the relationship between sleep  amyloid beta  and Alzheimer's disease. A series of recent clinical studies suggest that among patients who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease  worsening sleep quality and sleep duration are associated with a greater amount of amyloid beta building up in the brain  and while it's important to point out that these studies don't prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause Alzheimer's disease  they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid beta may contribute to the development of conditions like Alzheimer's. So what this new research tells us  then  is that the one thing that all of you already knew about sleep  that even Galen understood about sleep  that it refreshes and clears the mind  may actually be a big part of what sleep is all about. See  you and I  we go to sleep every single night  but our brains  they never rest. While our body is still and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere  the elegant machinery of the brain is quietly hard at work cleaning and maintaining this unimaginably complex machine. Like our housework  it's a dirty and a thankless job  but it's also important. In your house  if you stop cleaning your kitchen for a month  your home will become completely unlivable very quickly. But in the brain  the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty countertops  because when it comes to cleaning the brain  it is the very health and function of the mind and the body that's at stake  which is why understanding these very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow. Thank you. So imagine that a plane is about to crash with     children and babies  and if you knew how to stop that  would you  Now imagine that    planes full of babies under five crash every single day. That's the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday.  .  million children never make it to their fifth birthday. Most of these deaths are preventable  and that doesn't just make me sad  it makes me angry  and it makes me determined. Diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five  and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn't some smart  new technological innovations. It's one of the world's oldest inventions  a bar of soap. Washing hands with soap  a habit we all take for granted  can reduce diarrhea by half  can reduce respiratory infections by one third. Handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu  trachoma  SARS  and most recently in the case of cholera and Ebola outbreak  one of the key interventions is handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school. It stops babies from dying. Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost effective ways of saving children's lives. It can save over         children every year. That's the equivalent of stopping    jumbo jets full of babies and children from crashing every single day. I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty useful public health intervention. So now just take a minute. I think you need to get to know the person next to you. Why don't you just shake their hands. Please shake their hands. All right  get to know each other. They look really pretty. All right. So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn't wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet   Laughter  They don't look so pretty anymore  right  Pretty yucky  you would agree with me. Well  statistics are actually showing that four people out of five don't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet  globally. And the same way  we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets  running water  and soap available  it's the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high. What is it  Is there no soap  Actually  soap is available. In    percent of households in India     percent of households in Kenya  you will find soap. Even in countries where soap is the lowest  like Ethiopia  we are at    percent. So why is it  Why aren't people washing their hands  Why is it that Mayank  this young boy that I met in India  isn't washing his hands  Well  in Mayank's family  soap is used for bathing  soap is used for laundry  soap is used for washing dishes. His parents think sometimes it's a precious commodity  so they'll keep it in a cupboard. They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it. On average  in Mayank's family  they will use soap for washing hands once a day at the very best  and sometimes even once a week for washing hands with soap. What's the result of that  Children pick up disease in the place that's supposed to love them and protect them the most  in their homes. Think about where you learned to wash your hands. Did you learn to wash your hands at home  Did you learn to wash your hands in school  I think behavioral scientists will tell you that it's very difficult to change the habits that you have had early in life. However  we all copy what everyone else does  and local cultural norms are something that shape how we change our behavior  and this is where the private sector comes in. Every second in Asia and Africa      mothers will buy this bar to protect their family. Many women in India will tell you they learned all about hygiene  diseases  from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand. Iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good in the places where they sell their products. It's that belief  plus the scale of Unilever  that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers. Big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn. Think about it  Marketeers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other. And actually  they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages. Just for a minute  imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as powerful as handwashing with soap. The profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world. But it's been happening for centuries  the Lifebuoy brand was launched in      in Victorian England to actually combat cholera. Last week  I was in Ghana with the minister of health  because if you don't know  there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment. A hundred and eighteen years later  the solution is exactly the same  It's about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap  and that they're using it  because that's the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading. I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful  sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government. Government is doing what they can  especially in terms of the pandemics and epidemics such as cholera  or Ebola at the moment  but with competing priorities. The budget is not always there. And when you think about this  you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit  it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior. In short  those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the soap companies to keep promoting handwashing with soap. We have friends like USAID  the Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap  London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  Plan  WaterAid  that all believe for a win win win partnership. Win for the public sector  because we help them reach their targets. Win for the private sector  because we build new generations of future handwashers. And most importantly  win for the most vulnerable. On October     we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day. Schools  communities  our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector   yes  on that day even our competitors  we all join hands to celebrate the world's most important public health intervention. What's required  and again where the private sector can make a huge difference  is coming up with this big  creative thinking that drives advocacy. If you take our Help a Child Reach   campaign  we've created great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person in a way that can relate to them. We've had over    million views. Most of these discussions are still happening online. I urge you to take five minutes and look at those films. I come from Mali  one of the world's poorest countries. I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice. I trained in Europe's premier school of public health. I think I'm probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health  and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap. Nine years ago  I decided  with a successful public health career in the making  that I could make the biggest impact coming  selling and promoting the world's best invention in public health  soap. We run today the world's largest handwashing program by any public health standards. We've reached over     million people in    countries. My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by     . Over the last four years  business has grown double digits  whilst child mortality has reduced in all the places where soap use has increased. It may be uncomfortable for some to hear   business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence   but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more. Without it  and without talking about it  we cannot achieve the change that we need. Last week  my team and I spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing  the death of a newborn. I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful and more painful. This one is from Myanmar. She had the most beautiful smile  the smile  I think  that life gives you when you've had a second chance. Her son  Myo  is her second one. She had a daughter who passed away at three weeks  and we know that the majority of children that actually die die in the first month of their life  and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant  and that if soap is used  before touching the babies  we can reduce and make a change in terms of those numbers. And that's what inspires me  inspires me to continue in this mission  to know that I can equip her with what's needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world  nurturing her newborn. And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family  don't look far  buy her soap. It's the most beautiful invention in public health. I hope you will join us and make handwashing part of your daily lives and our daily lives and help more children like Myo reach their fifth birthday. Thank you. Almost a year ago  my aunt started suffering back pains. She went to see the doctor and they told her it was a normal injury for someone who had been playing tennis for almost    years. They recommended that she do some therapy  but after a while she wasn't feeling better  so the doctors decided to do further tests. They did an x ray and discovered an injury in her lungs  and at the time they thought that the injury was a strain in the muscles and tendons between her ribs  but after a few weeks of treatment  again her health wasn't getting any better. So finally  they decided to do a biopsy  and two weeks later  the results of the biopsy came back. It was stage   lung cancer. Her lifestyle was almost free of risk. She never smoked a cigarette  she never drank alcohol  and she had been playing sports for almost half her life. Perhaps  that is why it took them almost six months to get her properly diagnosed. My story might be  unfortunately  familiar to most of you. One out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer  and one out of four will die because of it. Not only did that cancer diagnosis change the life of our family  but that process of going back and forth with new tests  different doctors describing symptoms  discarding diseases over and over  was stressful and frustrating  especially for my aunt. And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done since the beginning of history. We have   st century medical treatments and drugs to treat cancer  but we still have   th century procedures and processes for diagnosis  if any. Today  most of us have to wait for symptoms to indicate that something is wrong. Today  the majority of people still don't have access to early cancer detection methods  even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have to a silver bullet cure against it. We know that we can change this in our lifetime  and that is why my team and I have decided to begin this journey  this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages and monitoring the appropriate  response at the molecular level easier  cheaper  smarter and more accessible than ever before. The context  of course  is that we're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates  and the biological realm is no exception. It is said today that biotech is advancing at least six times faster than the growth rate of the processing power of computers. But progress in biotech is not only being accelerated  it is also being democratized. Just as personal computers or the Internet or smartphones leveled the playing field for entrepreneurship  politics or education  recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well  and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches. We are a team of scientists and technologists from Chile  Panama  Mexico  Israel and Greece  and based on recent scientific discoveries  we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample. We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called microRNAs. To explain what microRNAs are and their important role in cancer  I need to start with proteins  because when cancer is present in our body  protein modification is observed in all cancerous cells. As you might know  proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body  like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating DNA  but before a protein is expressed or produced  relevant parts of its genetic code present in the DNA are copied into the messenger RNA  so this messenger RNA has instructions on how to build a specific protein  and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins  but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are microRNAs. So microRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression. Unlike DNA  which is mainly fixed  microRNAs can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time  telling us which genes are actively  expressed at that particular moment. And that is what makes microRNAs such a promising biomarker for cancer  because as you know  cancer is a disease of altered gene expression. It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes. Another important thing to consider is that no two cancers are the same  but at the microRNA level  there are patterns. Several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microRNA expression levels varies and creates a unique  specific pattern for each type of cancer  even at the early stages  reflecting the progression of the disease  and whether it's responding to medication or in remission  making microRNAs a perfect  highly sensitive biomarker. However  the problem with microRNAs is that we cannot use existing DNA based technology to detect them in a reliable way  because they are very short sequences of nucleotides  much smaller than DNA. And also  all microRNAs are very similar to each other  with just tiny differences. So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules  extremely similar  extremely small. We believe that we have found a way to do so  and this is the first time that we've shown it in public. Let me do a demonstration. Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test  a lab technician extracts a total RNA  which is quite simple today  and puts it in a standard     well plate like this one. Each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign  that is looking for a specific microRNA  acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample  and when it does  it will shine with green color. To run the reaction  you put the plate inside a device like this one  and then you can put your smartphone on top of it. If we can have a camera here so you can see my screen. A smartphone is a connected computer and it's also a camera  good enough for our purpose. The smartphone is taking pictures  and when the reaction is over  it will send the pictures to our online database for processing and interpretation. This entire process lasts around    minutes  but when the process is over  wells that shine are matched  with the specific microRNAs and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine. And then  when this entire process is over  this is what happens. This chart is showing the specific microRNAs present in this sample and how they reacted over time. Then  if we take this specific pattern of microRNA of this person's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that correlates microRNA patterns with a specific presence of a disease  this is how pancreatic cancer looks like. This inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer. Another important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud  so we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contextual information. If we want to better understand and decode diseases like cancer  we need to stop treating them as acute  isolated episodes  and consider and measure everything that affects our health on a permanent basis. This entire platform is a working prototype. It uses state of the art molecular biology  a low cost   D printed device  and data science to try to tackle one of humanity's  toughest challenges. Since we believe early cancer detection should really be democratized  this entire solution costs at least    times less than current available methods  and we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more  so we're making the design of the device open source. Let me say very clearly that we are at the very early stages  but so far  we have been able to successfully identify the microRNA pattern of pancreatic cancer  lung cancer  breast cancer and hepatic cancer. And currently  we're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center with     women for breast cancer. This is the single non invasive  accurate and affordable test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done. Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns in your blood at any given time  you don't need to know which cancer you're looking for. You don't need to have any symptoms. You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools. Today  cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear. That is  at stage   or    and I believe that is too late. It is too expensive for our families. It is too expensive for humanity. We cannot lose the war against cancer. It not only costs us billions of dollars  but it also costs us the people we love. Today  my aunt  she's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude. However  I want fights like this to become very rare. I want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages  and I'm certain that in the very near future  because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences  the way we see cancer will radically change. It will give us the chance of detecting it early  understanding it better  and finding a cure. Thank you very much. So I started working with refugees because I wanted to make a difference  and making a difference starts with telling their stories. So when I meet refugees  I always ask them questions. Who bombed your house  Who killed your son  Did the rest of your family make it out alive  How are you coping in your life in exile  But there's one question that always seems to me to be most revealing  and that is  What did you take  What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town  and the armed gangs were approaching your house  A Syrian refugee boy I know told me that he didn't hesitate when his life was in imminent danger. He took his high school diploma  and later he told me why. He said   I took my high school diploma because my life depended on it.  And he would risk his life to get that diploma. On his way to school  he would dodge snipers. His classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling  and his mother told me   Every day  I would say to him every morning  'Honey  please don't go to school.'  And when he insisted  she said   I would hug him as if it were for the last time.  But he said to his mother   We're all afraid  but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear.  But one day  the family got terrible news. Hany's aunt  his uncle and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house. Their throats were slit. It was time to flee. They left that day  right away  in their car  Hany hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers. And they would cross the border into Lebanon  where they would find peace. But they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony. They had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field  and this is Hany's brother Ashraf  who plays outside. And that day  they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world  in a country  Lebanon  that is tiny. It only has four million citizens  and there are one million Syrian refugees living there. There's not a town  a city or a village that is not host to Syrian refugees. This is generosity and humanity that is remarkable. Think about it this way  proportionately. It would be as if the entire population of Germany     million people  would flee to the United States in just three years. Half of the entire population of Syria is now uprooted  most of them inside the country. Six and a half million people have fled for their lives. Over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries  and only a small proportion  as you see  have moved on to Europe. What I find most worrying is that half of all Syrian refugees are children. I took this picture of this little girl. It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan. And most troubling of all is that only    percent of  Syrian refugee children are in school in Lebanon. And yet  Syrian refugee children  all refugee children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives. Why  Because it allows them to think of their future rather than the nightmare of their past. It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred. I'm reminded of a recent visit I took to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq  and I met this girl  and I thought   She's beautiful   and I went up to her and asked her   Can I take your picture   And she said yes  but she refused to smile. I think she couldn't  because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Syrian refugee children  a generation isolated and frustrated. And yet  look at what they fled  utter destruction  buildings  industries  schools  roads  homes. Hany's home was also destroyed. This will need to be rebuilt by architects  by engineers  by electricians. Communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge. Shouldn't this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake  the societies in exile  the refugees  Refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return. You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state. Well far from it. With wars going on and on  the average time a refugee will spend in exile is    years. Hany was into his second year in limbo when I went to visit him recently  and we conducted our entire conversation in English  which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of Dan Brown's novels and from listening to American rap. We also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf. But I'll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day. He said to me   If I am not a student  I am nothing.  Hany is one of    million people uprooted in this world today. Never since World War II have so many people been forcibly displaced. So while we're making sweeping progress in human health  in technology  in education and design  we are doing dangerously little to help the victims and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes. And there are more and more victims. Every day  on average  by the end of this day         people will be forcibly displaced from their homes          people. They flee across borders like this one. We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan  and this is a typical day. Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats  risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in Europe. This Syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized   most of the people drowned   and he told us   Syrians are just looking for a quiet place where nobody hurts you  where nobody humiliates you  and where nobody kills you.  Well  I think that should be the minimum. How about a place of healing  of learning  and even opportunity  Americans and Europeans have the impression that proportionally huge numbers of refugees are coming to their country  but the reality is that    percent  the vast majority of refugees  are living in the developing world  in countries struggling with their own insecurity  with their own issues of helping their own populations and poverty. So wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees. And all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border. Thank you. But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive. We can help them thrive. We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end. Rather  as centers of excellence  where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation. It makes so much sense  but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia that has been raging on for    years. And imagine living in this camp. I visited this camp. It's in Djibouti  neighboring Somalia  and it was so remote that we had to take a helicopter to fly there. It was dusty and it was terribly hot. And we went to visit a school and started talking to the children  and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own daughter  and I went up and talked to her. And I asked her the questions that grown ups ask kids  like   What is your favorite subject   and   What do you want to be when you grow up   And this is when her face turned blank  and she said to me   I have no future. My schooling days are over.  And I thought  there must be some misunderstanding  so I turned to my colleague and she confirmed to me there is no funding for secondary education in this camp. And how I wished at that moment that I could say to her   We will build you a school.  And I also thought  what a waste. She should be and she is the future of Somalia. A boy named Jacob Atem had a different chance  but not before he experienced terribly tragedy. He watched   this is in Sudan   as his village   he was only seven years old   burned to the ground  and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were killed that day. Only his cousin survived  and the two of them walked for seven months   this is boys like him   chased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs  and they finally made it to refugee camps where they found safety  and he would spend the next seven years in Kenya in a refugee camp. But his life changed when he got the chance to be resettled to the United States  and he found love in a foster family and he was able to go to school  and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university. I spoke to him on Skype the other day  and he was in his new university in Florida pursuing his Ph.D. in public health  and he proudly told me how he was able to raise enough funds from the American public to establish a health clinic back in his village back home. So I want to take you back to Hany. When I told him I was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the TED stage  he allowed me to read you a poem that he sent in an email to me. He wrote   I miss myself  my friends  times of reading novels or writing poems  birds and tea in the morning. My room  my books  myself  and everything that was making me smile. Oh  oh  I had so many dreams that were about to be realized.  So here is my point  Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity. Leave them abandoned  and they risk exploitation and abuse  and leave them unskilled and uneducated  and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries. I believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world. The victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace  and it's the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence. Hany is at a tipping point. We would love to help him go to university and to become an engineer  but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life  tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets  food rations and a bit of medicine. University is a luxury. But leave him to languish in this muddy field  and he will become a member of a lost generation. Hany's story is a tragedy  but it doesn't have to end that way. Thank you. I know a man who soars above the city every night. In his dreams  he twirls and swirls with his toes kissing the Earth. Everything has motion  he claims  even a body as paralyzed as his own. This man is my father. Three years ago  when I found out that my father had suffered a severe stroke in his brain stem  I walked into his room in the ICU at the Montreal Neurological Institute and found him lying deathly still  tethered to a breathing machine. Paralysis had closed over his body slowly  beginning in his toes  then legs  torso  fingers and arms. It made its way up his neck  cutting off his ability to breathe  and stopped just beneath the eyes. He never lost consciousness. Rather  he watched from within as his body shut down  limb by limb  muscle by muscle. In that ICU room  I walked up to my father's body  and with a quivering voice and through tears  I began reciting the alphabet. A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K. At K  he blinked his eyes. I began again. A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I. He blinked again at the letter I  then at T  then at R  and A  Kitra. He said  Kitra  my beauty  don't cry. This is a blessing.  There was no audible voice  but my father called out my name powerfully. Just    hours after his stroke  he had already embraced the totality of his condition. Despite his extreme physical state  he was completely present with me  guiding  nurturing  and being my father as much if not more than ever before. Locked in syndrome is many people's worst nightmare. In French  it's sometimes called  maladie de l'emmur  vivant.  Literally   walled in alive disease.  For many people  perhaps most  paralysis is an unspeakable horror  but my father's experience losing every system of his body was not an experience of feeling trapped  but rather of turning the psyche inwards  dimming down the external chatter  facing the recesses of his own mind  and in that place  falling in love with life and body anew. As a rabbi and spiritual man dangling between mind and body  life and death  the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him. He realized he no longer needed to look beyond the corporeal world in order to find the divine.  Paradise is in this body. It's in this world   he said. I slept by my father's side for the first four months  tending as much as I could to his every discomfort  understanding the deep  human psychological fear of not being able to call out for help. My mother  sisters  brother and I  we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing. We became his mouthpiece  spending hours each day reciting the alphabet as he whispered back sermons and poetry with blinks of his eye. His room  it became our temple of healing. His bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel  and through us  my father was able to speak and uplift  letter by letter  blink by blink. Everything in our world became slow and tender as the din  drama and death of the hospital ward faded into the background. I want to read to you one of the first things that we transcribed in the week following the stroke. He composed a letter  addressing his synagogue congregation  and ended it with the following lines   When my nape exploded  I entered another dimension  inchoate  sub planetary  protozoan. Universes are opened and closed continually. There are many when low  who stop growing. Last week  I was brought so low  but I felt the hand of my father around me  and my father brought me back.  When we weren't his voice  we were his legs and arms. I moved them like I know I would have wanted my own arms and legs to be moved were they still for all the hours of the day. I remember I'd hold his fingers near my face  bending each joint to keep it soft and limber. I'd ask him again and again to visualize the motion  to watch from within as the finger curled and extended  and to move along with it in his mind. Then  one day  from the corner of my eye  I saw his body slither like a snake  an involuntary spasm passing through the course of his limbs. At first  I thought it was my own hallucination  having spent so much time tending to this one body  so desperate to see anything react on its own. But he told me he felt tingles  sparks of electricity flickering on and off just beneath the surface of the skin. The following week  he began ever so slightly to show muscle resistance. Connections were being made. Body was slowly and gently reawakening  limb by limb  muscle by muscle  twitch by twitch. As a documentary photographer  I felt the need to photograph each of his first movements like a mother with her newborn. I photographed him taking his first unaided breath  the celebratory moment after he showed muscle resistance for the very first time  the new adapted technologies that allowed him to gain more and more independence. I photographed the care and the love that surrounded him. But my photographs only told the outside story of a man lying in a hospital bed attached to a breathing machine. I wasn't able to portray his story from within  and so I began to search for a new visual language  one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience. Finally  I want to share with you a video from a series that I've been working on that tries to express the slow  in between existence that my father has experienced. As he began to regain his ability to breathe  I started recording his thoughts  and so the voice that you hear in this video is his voice. you're paralyzed to play the part of a quadriplegic. I don't. In my mind  and in my dreams every night I Chagall man float over the city twirl and swirl with my toes kissing the floor. I know nothing about the statement of man without motion. Everything has motion. The heart pumps. The body heaves. The mouth moves. We never stagnate. Life triumphs up and down. Kitra Cahana  For most of us  our muscles begin to twitch and move long before we are conscious  but my father tells me his privilege is living on the far periphery of the human experience. Like an astronaut who sees a perspective that very few of us will ever get to share  he wonders and watches as he takes his first breaths and dreams about crawling back home. So begins life at     he says. A toddler has no attitude in its being  but a man insists on his world every day. Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has  but we will all have moments of paralysis in our lives. I know I frequently confront walls that feel completely unscalable  but my father insists that there are no dead ends. Instead  he invites me into his space of co healing to give the very best of myself  and for him to give the very best of himself to me. Paralysis was an opening for him. It was an opportunity to emerge  to rekindle life force  to sit still long enough with himself so as to fall in love with the full continuum of creation. Today  my father is no longer locked in. He moves his neck with ease  has had his feeding peg removed  breathes with his own lungs  speaks slowly with his own quiet voice  and works every day to gain more movement in his paralyzed body. But the work will never be finished. As he says   I'm living in a broken world  and there is holy work to do.  Thank you. Technology has brought us so much  the moon landing  the Internet  the ability to sequence the human genome. But it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears  and about    years ago  the culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book called  Amusing Ourselves to Death   which lays this out really brilliantly. And here's what he said  comparing the dystopian visions of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. He said  Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture. Orwell feared the truth would be concealed from us  and Huxley feared we would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. In a nutshell  it's a choice between Big Brother watching you and you watching Big Brother. But it doesn't have to be this way. We are not passive consumers of data and technology. We shape the role it plays in our lives and the way we make meaning from it  but to do that  we have to pay as much attention to how we think as how we code. We have to ask questions  and hard questions  to move past counting things to understanding them. We're constantly bombarded with stories about how much data there is in the world  but when it comes to big data and the challenges of interpreting it  size isn't everything. There's also the speed at which it moves  and the many varieties of data types  and here are just a few examples  images  text  video  audio. And what unites this disparate types of data is that they're created by people and they require context. Now  there's a group of data scientists out of the University of Illinois Chicago  and they're called the Health Media Collaboratory  and they've been working with the Centers for Disease Control to better understand how people talk about quitting smoking  how they talk about electronic cigarettes  and what they can do collectively to help them quit. The interesting thing is  if you want to understand how people talk about smoking  first you have to understand what they mean when they say  smoking.  And on Twitter  there are four main categories  number one  smoking cigarettes  number two  smoking marijuana  number three  smoking ribs  and number four  smoking hot women. So then you have to think about  well  how do people talk about electronic cigarettes  And there are so many different ways that people do this  and you can see from the slide it's a complex kind of a query. And what it reminds us is that language is created by people  and people are messy and we're complex and we use metaphors and slang and jargon and we do this      in many  many languages  and then as soon as we figure it out  we change it up. So did these ads that the CDC put on  these television ads that featured a woman with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic and very disturbing  did they actually have an impact on whether people quit  And the Health Media Collaboratory respected the limits of their data  but they were able to conclude that those advertisements   and you may have seen them   that they had the effect of jolting people into a thought process that may have an impact on future behavior. And what I admire and  appreciate about this project  aside from the fact  including the fact that it's based on real human need  is that it's a fantastic example of courage in the face of a sea of irrelevance. And so it's not just big data that causes challenges of interpretation  because let's face it  we human beings have a very rich history of taking any amount of data  no matter how small  and screwing it up. So many years ago  you may remember that former President Ronald Reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things. And it was a slip of the tongue  let's be fair. He actually meant to quote John Adams' defense of British soldiers in the Boston Massacre trials that facts are stubborn things. But I actually think there's a bit of accidental wisdom in what he said  because facts are stubborn things  but sometimes they're stupid  too. I want to tell you a personal story about why this matters a lot to me. I need to take a breath. My son Isaac  when he was two  was diagnosed with autism  and he was this happy  hilarious  loving  affectionate little guy  but the metrics on his developmental evaluations  which looked at things like  the number of words   at that point  none   communicative gestures and minimal eye contact  put his developmental level at that of a nine month old baby. And the diagnosis was factually correct  but it didn't tell the whole story. And about a year and a half later  when he was almost four  I found him in front of the computer one day running a Google image search on women  spelled  w i m e n.  And I did what any obsessed parent would do  which is immediately started  hitting the  back  button to see what else he'd been searching for. And they were  in order  men  school  bus and computer. And I was stunned  because we didn't know that he could spell  much less read  and so I asked him   Isaac  how did you do this   And he looked at me very seriously and said   Typed in the box.  He was teaching himself to communicate  but we were looking in the wrong place  and this is what happens when assessments and analytics overvalue one metric   in this case  verbal communication   and undervalue others  such as creative problem solving. Communication was hard for Isaac  and so he found a workaround to find out what he needed to know. And when you think about it  it makes a lot of sense  because forming a question is a really complex process  but he could get himself a lot of the way there by putting a word in a search box. And so this little moment had a really profound impact on me and our family because it helped us change our frame of reference for what was going on with him  and worry a little bit less and appreciate his resourcefulness more. Facts are stupid things. And they're vulnerable to misuse  willful or otherwise. I have a friend  Emily Willingham  who's a scientist  and she wrote a piece for Forbes not long ago entitled  The    Weirdest Things Ever Linked to Autism.  It's quite a list. The Internet  blamed for everything  right  And of course mothers  because. And actually  wait  there's more  there's a whole bunch in  the  mother  category here. And you can see it's a pretty  rich and interesting list. I'm a big fan of being pregnant near freeways  personally. The final one is interesting  because the term  refrigerator mother  was actually the original hypothesis for the cause of autism  and that meant somebody  who was cold and unloving. And at this point  you might be thinking   Okay  Susan  we get it  you can take data  you can  make it mean anything.  And this is true  it's absolutely true  but the challenge is that we have this opportunity to try to make meaning out of it ourselves  because frankly  data doesn't  create meaning. We do. So as businesspeople  as consumers  as patients  as citizens  we have a responsibility  I think  to spend more time focusing on our critical thinking skills. Why  Because at this point in our history  as we've heard many times over  we can process exabytes of data at lightning speed  and we have the potential to make bad decisions far more quickly  efficiently  and with far greater impact than we did in the past. Great  right  And so what we need to do instead is spend a little bit more time on things like the humanities and sociology  and the social sciences  rhetoric  philosophy  ethics  because they give us context that is so important for big data  and because they help us become better critical thinkers. Because after all  if I can spot a problem in an argument  it doesn't much matter whether it's expressed in words or in numbers. And this means teaching ourselves to find  those confirmation biases and false correlations and being able to spot a naked emotional appeal from    yards  because something that happens after something doesn't mean it happened  because of it  necessarily  and if you'll let me geek out on you for a second  the Romans called this   post hoc ergo propter hoc   after which therefore because of which. And it means questioning disciplines like demographics. Why  Because they're based on assumptions about who we all are based on our gender and our age and where we live as opposed to data on what  we actually think and do. And since we have this data  we need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls and consumer opt in  and beyond that  we need to be clear about our hypotheses  the methodologies that we use  and our confidence in the result. As my high school algebra teacher used to say  show your math  because if I don't know what steps you took  I don't know what steps you didn't take  and if I don't know what questions you asked  I don't know what questions you didn't ask. And it means asking ourselves  really  the hardest question of all  Did the data really show us this  or does the result make us feel more successful and more comfortable  So the Health Media Collaboratory  at the end of their project  they were able to find that    percent of tweets about those very graphic and disturbing anti smoking ads expressed fear  but did they conclude that they actually made people stop smoking  No. It's science  not magic. So if we are to unlock the power of data  we don't have to go blindly into Orwell's vision of a totalitarian future  or Huxley's vision of a trivial one  or some horrible cocktail of both. What we have to do is treat critical thinking with respect and be inspired by examples like the Health Media Collaboratory  and as they say in the superhero movies  let's use our powers for good. Thank you. I experienced my first coup d' tat at the age of four. Because of the coup d' tat  my family had to leave my native home of Ghana and move to the Gambia. As luck would have it  six months after we arrived  they too had a military coup. I vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night and gathering the few belongings we could and walking for about two hours to a safe house. For a week  we slept under our beds because we were worried that bullets might fly through the window. Then  at the age of eight  we moved to Botswana. This time  it was different. There were no coups. Everything worked. Great education. They had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had a fiber optic telephone system  long before it had reached Western countries. The only thing they didn't have is that they didn't have their own national television station  and so I remember watching TV from neighboring South Africa  and watching Nelson Mandela in jail being offered a chance to come out if he would give up the apartheid struggle. But he didn't. He refused to do that until he actually achieved his objective of freeing South Africa from apartheid. And I remember feeling how just one good leader could make such a big difference in Africa. Then at the age of     my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe. Initially  this too was amazing  growing economy  excellent infrastructure  and it seemed like it was a model for economic development in Africa. I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe and I went off to college. Six years later  I returned to the country. Everything was different. It had shattered into pieces. Millions of people had emigrated  the economy was in a shambles  and it seemed all of a sudden that    years of development had been wiped out. How could a country go so bad so fast  Most people would agree that it's all because of leadership. One man  President Robert Mugabe  is almost single handedly responsible for having destroyed this country. Now  all these experiences of living in different parts of Africa growing up did two things to me. The first is it made me fall in love with Africa. Everywhere I went  I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people  and at the time  I realized that I wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to making this continent great. But I also realized that making Africa great would require addressing this issue of leadership. You see  all these countries I lived in  the coups d' tat and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia and in Zimbabwe  contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen in Botswana and in South  Africa of good leadership. It made me realize that Africa would rise or fall because of the quality of our leaders. Now  one might think  of course  leadership matters everywhere. But if there's one thing you take away from my talk today  it is this  In Africa  more than anywhere else in the world  the difference that just one good leader can make is much greater than anywhere  else  and here's why. It's because in Africa  we have weak institutions  like the judiciary  the constitution  civil society and so forth. So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in  When societies have strong institutions  the difference that one good leader can make is limited  but when you have weak institutions  then just one good leader can make or break that country. Let me make it a bit more concrete. You become the president of the United States. You think   Wow  I've arrived. I'm the most powerful man in the world.  So you decide  perhaps let me pass a law. All of a sudden  Congress taps you on the shoulder and says   No  no  no  no  no  you can't do that.  You say   Let me try this way.  The Senate comes and says   Uh uh  we don't think you can do that.  You say  perhaps   Let me print some money. I think the economy needs a stimulus.  The central bank governor will think you're crazy. You might get impeached for that. But if you become the president of Zimbabwe  and you say   You know  I really like this job. I think I'd like to stay in it forever.   Laughter  Well  you just can. You decide you want to print money. You call the central bank governor and you say   Please double the money supply.  He'll say   Okay  yes  sir  is there anything else I can do for you   This is the power that African leaders have  and this is why they make the most difference on the continent. The good news is that the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving. We've had three generations  of leaders  in my mind. Generation one are those who appeared in the '  s and '  s. These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania. The legacy they left is that they brought independence to Africa. They freed us from colonialism  and let's give them credit for that. They were followed by generation two. These are people that brought nothing but havoc to Africa. Think warfare  corruption  human rights abuses. This is the stereotype of  the typical African leader that we typically think of  Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire  Sani Abacha from Nigeria. The good news is that most of these leaders have moved on  and they were replaced by generation three. These are people like the late Nelson Mandela and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today  like Paul Kagame and so forth. Now these leaders are by no means perfect  but the one thing they have done is that they have cleaned up much of the mess of generation two. They've stopped the fighting  and I call them the stabilizer generation. They're much more accountable to their people  they've improved macroeconomic policies  and we are seeing for the first time Africa's growing  and in  fact it's the second fastest growing economic region in the world. So these leaders are by no means perfect  but they are by and large the best leaders we've seen in the last    years. So where to from here  I believe that the next generation to come after this  generation four  has a unique opportunity to transform the continent. Specifically  they can do two things that previous generations have not done. The first thing they need to do is they need to create prosperity for the continent. Why is prosperity so important  Because none of the previous generations have been able to tackle this issue of poverty. Africa today has the fastest growing population in the world  but also is the poorest. By       Africa will have a larger workforce than China  and by       it will have the largest workforce in the world. One billion people will need jobs in Africa  so if we don't grow our economies fast enough  we're sitting on a ticking time bomb  not just for Africa but for the entire world. Let me show you an example of one person who is living up to this legacy of creating prosperity  Laetitia. Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya who at the age of    had to drop out of school because her family couldn't  afford to pay fees for her. So she started her own business rearing rabbits  which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya that she's from. This business did so well that within a year  she was employing    women and was able to generate enough income that she was able to send herself to school  and through these women fund another    children to go to school. The profits that she generated  she used that to build a school  and today she educates     children in her community. And she's just turned   . Another example is Erick Rajaonary. Erick comes from the island of Madagascar. Now  Erick realized that agriculture would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of Madagascar  but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar. Madagascar has these very special bats that produce these droppings that are very high in nutrients. In       Erick quit his job  as a chartered accountant and started a company to manufacture fertilizer from the bat droppings. Today  Erick has built a business that generates several million dollars of revenue  and he employs    people full time and another     people during the season when the bats drop their droppings the most. Now  what I like about this story is that it shows that opportunities  to create prosperity can be found almost anywhere. Erick is known as the Batman. And who would have thought that you would have been able to build a multimillion dollar business employing so many people just from bat poo  The second thing that this generation needs to do is to create our institutions. They need to build these institutions such that we are never held to ransom again by a few individuals like Robert Mugabe. Now  all of this sounds great  but where are we going to get this generation four from  Do we just sit and hope that they emerge by chance  or that God gives them to us  No  I don't think so. It's too important an issue  for us to leave it to chance. I believe that we need to create African institutions  home grown  that will identify and develop these leaders in a systematic  practical way. We've been doing this for the last    years through the African Leadership Academy. Laetitia is one of our young leaders. Today  we have     of them  that are being groomed for the African continent  and over the next    years  we expect to create       of them. But one thing has been troubling me. We would get about       applications a year for     young leaders that we could take into this academy  and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed for this leadership training that we're offering. But we couldn't satisfy it. So today  I'm announcing for the first time in public an extension to this vision for the African Leadership Academy. We're building    brand new universities in Africa that are going to cultivate this next generation of African leaders. Each campus will have        leaders at a time so we'll be educating and developing         leaders at any given time. Over the next    years  this institution will create three million transformative leaders for the continent. My hope is that half of them will become the entrepreneurs that we need  who will create these jobs that we need  and the other half will go into government and the nonprofit sector  and they will build the institutions that we need. But they won't just learn academics. They will also learn how to become leaders  and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs. So think of this as Africa's Ivy League  but instead of getting admitted because of your SAT scores or because of how much money you have or which family you come from  the main criteria for getting into this university will be what is the potential that you have for transforming Africa  But what we're doing is  just one group of institutions. We cannot transform Africa by ourselves. My hope is that many  many other home grown African institutions will blossom  and these institutions will all come together with a common vision of developing this next generation of African leaders  generation four  and they will teach them this common message  create jobs  build our institutions. Nelson Mandela once said   Every now and then  a generation is called upon to be great. You can be that great generation.  I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate the next generation of African leaders  then this generation four that is coming up will be the greatest generation that Africa and indeed the entire world has ever seen. Thank you. I suspect that every aid worker in Africa comes to a time in her career when she wants to take all  the money for her project   maybe it's a school or a training program   pack it in a suitcase  get on a plane flying over the poorest villages in the country  and start throwing that money out the window. Because to a veteran aid worker  the idea of putting cold  hard cash into the hands of the poorest people on Earth doesn't sound crazy  it sounds really satisfying. I had that moment right about the    year mark  and luckily  that's also when I learned that this idea actually exists  and it might be just what the aid system needs. Economists call it an unconditional cash transfer  and it's exactly that  It's cash given with no strings attached. Governments in developing countries have been doing this for decades  and it's only now  with more evidence and new technology that it's possible to make this a model for delivering aid. It's a pretty simple idea  right  Well  why did I spend a decade doing other stuff for the poor  Honestly  I believed that I could do more good with money for the poor than the poor could do for themselves. I held two assumptions  One  that poor people are poor in part because they're uneducated and don't make good choices  two is that we then need people like me to figure out what they need and get it to them. It turns out  the evidence says otherwise. In recent years  researchers have been studying what happens when we give poor people cash. Dozens of studies show across the board that people use cash transfers to improve their own lives. Pregnant women in Uruguay buy better food and give birth to healthier babies. Sri Lankan men invest in their businesses. Researchers who studied our work in Kenya found that people invested in a range of assets  from livestock to equipment  to home improvements  and they saw increases in income from business and farming one year after the cash was sent. None of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people work less. In fact  they work more. Now  these are all material needs. In Vietnam  elderly recipients used their cash transfers to pay for coffins. As someone who wonders if Maslow got it wrong  I find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs deeply humbling. I don't know if I would have chosen to give food or equipment or coffins  which begs the question  How good are we at allocating resources on behalf of the poor  Are we worth the cost  Again  we can look at empirical evidence on what happens when we give people stuff of our choosing. One very telling study looked at a program in India that gives livestock to the so called ultra poor  and they found that    percent of recipients had turned around and sold the livestock they had been given for cash. The real irony is  for every     dollars worth of assets this program gave someone  they spent another    dollars to do it. What if  instead  we use technology to put cash  whether from aid agencies or from any one of us directly into a poor person's hands. Today  three in four Kenyans use mobile money  which is basically a bank account that can run on any cell phone. A sender can pay a  .  percent fee and with the click of a button send money directly to a recipient's account with no intermediaries. Like the technologies that are disrupting industries in our own lives  payments technology in poor countries could disrupt aid. It's spreading so quickly that it's possible to imagine reaching billions of the world's poor this way. That's what we've started to do at GiveDirectly. We're the first organization dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor. We've sent cash to         people across rural Kenya and Uganda in one time payments of       dollars per family. So far  we've looked for the poorest people in the poorest villages  and in this part of the world  they're the ones living in homes made of mud and thatch  not cement and iron. So let's say that's your family. We show up at your door with an Android phone. We'll get your name  take your photo and a photo of your hut and grab the GPS coordinates. That night  we send all the data to the cloud  and each piece gets checked by an independent team using  for one example  satellite images. Then  we'll come back  we'll sell you a basic cell phone if you don't have one already  and a few weeks later  we send money to it. Something that five years ago would have seemed impossible we can now do efficiently and free of corruption. The more cash we give to the poor  and the more evidence we have that it works  the more we have to reconsider everything else we give. Today  the logic behind aid is too often  well  we do at least some good. When we're complacent with that as our bar  when we tell ourselves that giving aid is better than no aid at all  we tend to invest inefficiently  in our own ideas that strike us as innovative  on writing reports  on plane tickets and SUVs. What if the logic was  will we do better than cash given directly  Organizations would have to prove that they're doing more good for the poor than the poor can do for themselves. Of course  giving cash won't create public goods like eradicating disease or  building strong institutions  but it could set a higher bar for how we help individual families improve their lives. I believe in aid. I believe most aid is better than just throwing money out of a plane. I am also absolutely certain that a lot of aid today isn't better than giving directly to the poor. I hope that one day  it will be. Thank you. I have a confession to make. I am addicted to adventure  and as a young boy  I would rather look outside the window at the birds in the trees and the sky than looking at that two dimensional chalky blackboard where time stands still and even sometimes dies. My teachers thought there was something wrong with me because I wasn't paying attention in class. They didn't find anything  specifically wrong with me  other than being slightly  dyslexic because I'm a lefty. But they didn't test for curiosity. Curiosity  to me  is about our connection with the world  with the universe. It's about seeing what's  around that next coral head or what's around that next tree  and learning more not only about our environment but about ourselves. Now  my dream of dreams  I want to go explore the oceans of Mars  but until we can go there  I think the oceans still hold quite a few secrets. As a matter of fact  if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is and dissect it into a living space  the ocean represents over  .  billion cubic kilometers of volume  within which we've explored less than five percent. And I look at this  and I go  well  there are tools to go  deeper  longer and further  submarines  ROVs  even Scuba diving. But if we're going to explore the final frontier on this planet  we need to live there. We need to build a log cabin  if you will  at the bottom of the sea. And so there was a great curiosity in my soul when I went to go visit a TED  Prize winner  by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle. Maybe you've heard of her. Two years ago  she was staked out at the last undersea marine laboratory to try and save it  to try and petition for us not to scrap it and bring it back on land. We've only had about a dozen or so scientific labs at the bottom of the sea. There's only one left in the world  it's nine miles offshore and    feet down. It's called Aquarius. Aquarius  in some fashion  is a dinosaur  an ancient robot chained to the bottom  this Leviathan. In other ways  it's a legacy. And so with that visit  I realized  that my time is short if I wanted to experience what it was like to become an aquanaut. When we swam towards this after many moons of torture and two years of preparation  this habitat waiting to invite us was like a new home. And the point of going down to and living at this habitat was not to stay inside. It wasn't about living at something the size of a school bus. It was about giving us the luxury of time outside to wander  to explore  to understand more about this oceanic final frontier. We had megafauna come and visit us. This spotted eagle ray is a fairly common sight in the oceans. But why this is so important  why this picture is up  is because this particular animal brought his friends around  and instead of being the pelagic animals that they were  they started getting curious about us  these new strangers that were moving into the neighborhood  doing things with plankton. We were studying all sorts of animals and critters  and they got closer and closer to us  and because of the luxury of time  these animals  these residents of the coral reef  were starting to get used to us  and these pelagics that normal travel through stopped. This particular animal actually circled for    full days during our mission. So mission    wasn't so much about breaking records. It was about that human ocean connection. Because of the luxury of time  we were able to study animals such as sharks and grouper in aggregations that we've never seen before. It's like seeing dogs and  cats behaving well together. Even being able to commune with animals that are much larger than us  such as this endangered goliath grouper who only still resides in the Florida Keys. Of course  just like any neighbor  after a while  if they get tired  the goliath grouper barks at us  and this bark is so powerful that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all within a split second. For us  it's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone. Now  this wasn't just about adventure. There was actually a serious note to it. We did a lot of science  and again  because of the luxury of time  we were able to do over three years of science in    days. In this particular case  we were using a PAM  or  let me just see if I can get this straight  a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer. And our scientists from FIU  MIT  and from Northeastern were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do when we're not around. The Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer  or PAM  gauges the fluorescence of corals as it pertains to pollutants in the water as well as climate change related issues. We used all sorts of other cutting edge tools  such as this sonde  or what I like to call the sponge proctologist  whereby the sonde itself tests for metabolism rates in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge  or the redwoods of the  ocean . And this gives us a much better gauge of what's happening underwater with regard to climate change related issues  and how the dynamics of that affect us here on land. And finally  we looked at predator prey behavior. And predator prey behavior is an interesting thing  because as we take away some of the predators on these coral reefs around the world  the prey  or the forage fish  act very differently. What we realized is not only do they stop taking care of the reef  darting in  grabbing a little bit of algae and going back into their homes  they start spreading out and disappearing from those particular coral reefs. Well  within that    days  we were able to generate over    scientific papers on each one of these topics. But the point of adventure is not only to learn  it's to be able to share that  knowledge with the world  and with that  thanks to a  couple of engineers at MIT  we were able to use a prototype camera called the Edgertronic to capture slow motion video  up to        frames per second in a little box that's worth       dollars. It's available to every one of us. And that particular camera gives us an insight into what fairly common animals do but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye. Let me show you a quick video of what this camera does. You can see the silky bubble come out of our hard hats. It gives us an insight into some of the animals that we were sitting right next to for    days and never normally would have paid attention to  such as hermit crabs. Now  using a cutting edge piece of technology that's not really meant for the oceans is not always easy. We sometimes had to put the camera upside down  cordon it back to the lab  and actually man the trigger from the lab itself. But what this gives us is the foresight to look at and analyze in scientific and engineering terms some of the most amazing behavior that the human eye just can't pick up  such as this manta shrimp trying to catch its prey  within about .  seconds. That punch is as strong as a .   caliber bullet  and if you ever try to catch a bullet in mid flight with your eye  impossible. But now we can see things such as these Christmas tree worms pulling in and fanning out in a way that the eye just can't capture  or in this case  a fish throwing up grains of sand. This is an actual sailfin goby  and if you look at it in real time  it actually doesn't even show its fanning motion because it's so quick. One of the most precious gifts that we had underwater is that we had WiFi  and for    days straight we were able to connect with the world in real time  from the bottom of the sea and share all of these experiences. Quite literally right there I am Skyping in the classroom with one of the six continents and some of the         students that we connected every single day to some of these experiences. As a matter of fact  I'm showing a picture that I took with my smartphone from underwater of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom. We had never seen that before. And I dream of the day that we have underwater cities  and maybe  just maybe  if we push the boundaries of adventure and knowledge  and we share that knowledge with others out there  we can solve all sorts of problems. My grandfather used to say   People protect what they love.  My father   How can people protect what they don't understand   And I've thought about this my whole life. Nothing is impossible. We need to dream  we need to be creative  and we all need to have an adventure in order to create miracles in the darkest of times. And whether it's about climate change or eradicating poverty or giving back to future generations what we've taken for granted  it's about adventure. And who knows  maybe there will be underwater cities  and maybe some of you will become the future aquanauts. Thank you very much. George and Charlotte Blonsky  who were a married couple living in the Bronx in New York City  invented something. They got a patent in      for what they call   a device to assist women in giving birth.  This device consists of a large  round table and some machinery. When the woman is ready to deliver her child  she lies on her back  she is strapped down to the table  and the table is rotated at high speed. The child comes flying out through centrifugal force. If you look at their patent carefully  especially if you have any engineering background or talent  you may decide that you see one or two points where the design is  not perfectly adequate.  Laughter  Doctor Ivan Schwab in California is one of the people   one of the main people  who helped answer the question   Why don't woodpeckers get headaches   And it turns out the answer to that is because their brains are packaged inside their skulls in a way different from the way our brains  we being human beings  true  have our brains packaged. They  the woodpeckers  typically will peck  they will bang their head on a piece of wood thousands  of times every day. Every day  And as far as anyone knows  that doesn't bother them in the slightest. How does this happen  Their brain does not slosh around like ours does. Their brain is packed in very tightly  at least for blows coming  right from the front. Not too many people paid attention to this research until the last few years when  in this country especially  people are becoming curious about what happens to the brains of football players who bang their heads repeatedly. And the woodpecker maybe relates to that. There was a paper published in the medical journal The Lancet in England a few years ago called   A man who pricked his finger and smelled putrid for   years.  Dr. Caroline Mills and her team received this patient and didn't  really know what to do about it. The man had cut his finger  he worked processing chickens  and then he started to smell really  really bad. So bad that when  he got in a room with the doctors and the nurses  they couldn't stand being  in the room with him. It was intolerable. They tried every drug  every other treatment they could think of. After a year  he still  smelled putrid. After two years  still smelled putrid. Three years  four years  still smelled putrid. After five years  it went away on its own. It's a mystery. In New Zealand  Dr. Lianne Parkin and her team tested an old  tradition in her city. They live in a city that has huge hills  San Francisco grade hills. And in the winter there  it gets very cold and very icy. There are lots of injuries. The tradition that they tested  they tested by asking people who were on their way to  work in the morning  to stop and try something out. Try one of two conditions. The tradition is that in the winter  in that city  you wear your socks on the outside of your boots. And what they discovered by experiment  and it was quite graphic when they saw it  was that it's true. That if you wear your socks on the  outside rather than the inside  you're much more likely  to survive and not slip and fall. Now  I hope you will agree with me that these things I've just described to you  each of them  deserves some kind of prize.  Laughter  And that's what they got  each of them got an Ig Nobel prize. In       I  together with bunch of other people  started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony. Every year we give out    prizes. The prizes are based on just  one criteria. It's very simple. It's that you've done something that  makes people laugh and then think. What you've done makes  people laugh and then think. Whatever it is  there's something about it that when people encounter it at first  their only possible reaction is to laugh. And then a week later  it's still rattling around in their heads and all they want to do  is tell their friends about it. That's the quality we look for. Every year  we get in the neighborhood of       new nominations  for the Ig Nobel prize. Of those  consistently between    percent and    percent of those nominations are people who nominate themselves. Those self nominees almost never win. It's very difficult  numerically   to win a prize if you want to. Even if you don't want to  it's very difficult numerically. You should know that when  we choose somebody to win an Ig Nobel prize  We get in touch with that person  very quietly. We offer them the chance to decline this great honor if they want to. Happily for us  almost everyone  who's offered a prize decides to accept. What do you get if you win an Ig Nobel prize  Well  you get several things. You get an Ig Nobel prize. The design is different every year. These are always handmade from extremely cheap materials. You're looking at a picture of the prize we gave last year      . Most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash  some money. We don't have any money  so we can't give them. In fact  the winners have to pay their own way to come to the Ig Nobel ceremony  which most of them do. Last year  though  we did manage to scrape up some money. Last year  each of the    Ig Nobel prize winners received from us    trillion dollars. A     trillion bill from Zimbabwe.  Laughter  You may remember that  Zimbabwe had a little adventure for a few years there of inflation. They ended up printing bills that were in denominations as large as     trillion dollars. The man responsible  who runs the national bank there  by the way  won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics. The other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony  which happens at Harvard University. And when you get there  you come to Harvard's biggest  meeting place and classroom. It fits       people  it's jammed to the gills  and up on the stage  waiting to shake your hand  waiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize  are a bunch of Nobel prize winners. That's the heart of the ceremony. The winners are kept secret until that moment  even the Nobel laureates  who will shake their hand don't know who they are until they're announced. I am going to tell you  about just a very few of the other medical related prizes we've given. Keep in mind  we've given     prizes. There are lots of these people who walk among you. Maybe you have one. A paper was published about    years ago called  Injuries due to Falling Coconuts.  It was written by Dr. Peter Barss  who is Canadian. Dr. Barss came to the ceremony and explained that as a young doctor  he wanted to see the world. So he went to Papua New Guinea. When he got there  he went to work in a hospital  and he was curious what kinds of things happen to people that bring them to the hospital. He looked through the  records  and he discovered that a surprisingly large number of people in that hospital were there because of injuries due to falling coconuts. One typical thing that happens is people will come from the highlands  where there are not many coconut trees  down to visit their relatives on the coast  where there are lots. And they'll think that a coconut tree is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down. A coconut tree that is    feet tall  and has coconuts that weigh two pounds that can drop off at any time. A team of doctors in Europe published a series of papers about colonoscopies. You're all familiar with colonoscopies  one way or another. Or in some cases  one way and another. They  in these papers  explained to their fellow doctors who perform colonoscopies  how to minimize the chance that when you perform a colonoscopy  your patient will explode.  Laughter  Dr. Emmanuel Ben Soussan one of the authors  flew in from Paris to the ceremony  where he explained the history of this  that in the     s  when colonoscopies were becoming a common technique for the first time  people were figuring out how to do it well. And there were some difficulties at first. The basic problem  I'm sure you're familiar with  that you're looking inside a  long  narrow  dark place. And so  you want to have a larger space. You add some gas to inflate it so you have room to look around. Now  that's added to the  gas  the methane gas  that's already inside. The gas that they used at first  in many cases  was oxygen. So they added oxygen to methane gas. And then they wanted to be able to see  they needed light  so they'd put in a light source  which in the     s was very hot. So you had methane gas  which is flammable  oxygen and heat. They stopped using oxygen pretty quickly.  Laughter  Now it's rare that patients will explode  but it does still happen. The final thing that I want  to tell you about is a prize we gave to Dr. Elena Bodnar. Dr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere that in an emergency can be quickly separated into a pair of protective face masks. One to save your life  one to save the life of some  lucky bystander.  Laughter  Why would someone do this  you might wonder. Dr. Bodnar came to the ceremony and she explained that  she grew up in Ukraine. She was one of the doctors who treated victims of the Chernobyl power plant meltdown. And they later discovered that a lot of the worst medical problems came from the particles people breathed in. So she was always thinking after that about could there be some simple mask that was available everywhere when the unexpected happens. Years later  she moved to America. She had a baby  One day she looked  and on the floor  her infant son had picked up her bra  and had her bra on his face. And that's where the idea came from. She came to the Ig Nobel ceremony with the first prototype of the bra and she demonstrated    Paul Krugman  Nobel laureate         in economics     Wolfgang Ketterle  Nobel  laureate        in physics   I myself own an emergency bra.  Laughter  It's my favorite bra  but I would be happy to  share it with any of you  should the need arise. Thank you. Let me tell you a story about a little girl named Naghma. Naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters. Every morning  her father would wake up in the hopes he'd be picked for construction work  and on a good month he would earn    dollars. The winter was very harsh  and unfortunately  Naghma's brother died and her mother became very ill. In desperation  her father went to a neighbor to borrow       dollars. After several months of waiting  the neighbor became very impatient  and he demanded that he be paid back. Unfortunately  Naghma's father didn't have the money  and so the two men agreed to a jirga. So simply put  a jirga is a form of mediation that's used in Afghanistan's  informal justice system. It's usually presided over by religious leaders and village elders  and jirgas are often used in rural countries like Afghanistan  where there's deep seated resentment against the formal system. At the jirga  the men sat together and they decided that the  best way to satisfy the debt would be if Naghma married the neighbor's    year old son. She was six. Now  stories like Naghma's unfortunately are all too common  and from the comforts of our home  we may look at these stories as another crushing blow to women's rights. And if you watched Afghanistan on the news  you may have this view that it's a failed state. However  Afghanistan does have a legal system  and while jirgas are built on long standing tribal customs  even in jirgas  laws are supposed to be followed  and it goes without saying that giving a child to satisfy a debt is not only grossly immoral  it's illegal. In       I went to Afghanistan for a justice funded program  and I went there originally  on this nine month program to train Afghan lawyers. In that nine months  I went around the country and I talked to hundreds of people that were locked up  and I talked to many businesses that were also operating in Afghanistan. And within these conversations  I started hearing the connections between the businesses and the people  and how laws that were meant to protect them were being underused  while gross and illegal punitive measures were overused. And so this put me on a quest for justness  and what justness means to me is using laws for their intended purpose  which is to protect. The role of laws is to protect. So as a result  I decided to  open up a private practice  and I became the first foreigner to litigate in Afghan courts. Throughout this time  I also studied many laws  I talked to many people  I read up on many cases  and I found that the lack of justness is not just a problem in Afghanistan  but it's a global problem. And while I originally shied away from representing human rights cases because I was really concerned about how it would affect me both professionally and personally  I decided that the need for justness was so great that I couldn't continue to ignore it. And so I started representing people like Naghma pro bono also. Now  since I've been in Afghanistan and since I've been an attorney for over    years  I've represented from CEOs  of Fortune     companies to ambassadors to little girls like Naghma  and with much success. And the reason for my success is very simple  I work the system from the inside out and use the laws in the ways that they're intended to be used. I find that achieving justness in places like Afghanistan is difficult  and there's three reasons. The first reason is that simply put  people are very uneducated as to what their legal rights were  and I find that this is a global problem. The second issue is that even with laws on the books  it's often superseded or ignored by tribal customs  like in the first jirga that sold Naghma off. And the third problem with achieving justness is that even with good  existing laws on the books  there aren't people or lawyers  that are willing to fight for those laws. And that's what I do  I use existing laws  often unused laws  and I work those to the benefits of my clients. We all need to create a global culture of human rights and be investors in a global  human rights economy  and by working in this mindset  we can significantly improve justice globally. Now let's get back to Naghma. Several people heard about this story  and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the        debt. And it's not just that simple  you can't just throw money at this problem and think that it's going to disappear. That's not how it works in Afghanistan. So I told them I'd get involved  but in order to get involved   what needed to happen is a second jirga needed to be called  a jirga of appeals. And so in order for that to happen  we needed to get the village elders together  we needed to get the tribal leaders together  the religious leaders. Naghma's father needed to agree  the neighbor needed to agree  and also his son needed to agree. And I thought  if I'm going to  get involved in this thing  then they also need to agree  that I preside over it. So  after hours of talking and tracking them down  and about    cups of tea  they finally agreed that we could sit down for a second jirga  and we did. And what was different about the second jirga is this time  we put the law at the center of it  and it was very important for me that they all understood that Naghma had a right to be protected. And at the end of this jirga  it was ordered by the judge that the first decision was erased  and that the        debt was satisfied  and we all signed a written order where all the men acknowledged that what they did was illegal  and if they did it again  that  they would go to prison. Most   Thanks. And most importantly  the engagement was terminated and Naghma was free. Protecting Naghma and her right to be free protects us. Now  with my job  there's above average amount of risks that are involved. I've been temporarily detained. I've been accused of running a brothel  accused of being a spy. I've had a grenade thrown at my office. It didn't go off  though. But I find that with my job  that the rewards far outweigh the risks  and as many risks as I take  my clients take far greater risks  because they have a lot more to lose if their cases go unheard  or worse  if they're penalized for having me as their lawyer. With every case that I take  I realize that as much as I'm standing behind my clients  that they're also standing behind me  and that's what keeps me going. Law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us. Journalists are very vital in making sure that that information is given to the public. Too often  we receive information from journalists but we forget how that information was given. This picture is a picture of the British press corps in Afghanistan. It was taken a couple of years ago by my friend David Gill. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists  since       there have been  thousands of journalists who have been threatened  injured  killed  detained. Too often  when we get this information  we forget who it affects or how that information is given to us. What many journalists do   both foreign and domestic  is very remarkable  especially in places like Afghanistan  and it's important that we never forget that  because what they're protecting is not only our right to receive that information but also the freedom of the press  which is vital to a democratic society. Matt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan. He works for The New York Times  and unfortunately  a few months ago he wrote an article that displeased people in the government. As a result  he was temporarily detained and he was illegally exiled out of the country. I represent Matt  and after dealing with the government  I was able to get legal acknowledgment that in fact he was illegally exiled  and that freedom of the press does exist in Afghanistan  and there's consequences if that's not followed. And I'm happy to say that as of a few days ago  the Afghan government formally invited him back into the country and they reversed their exile order of him. If you censor one journalist   then it intimidates others  and soon nations are silenced. It's important that we protect our journalists and freedom of the press  because that makes governments more accountable to us and more transparent. Protecting journalists and our right to receive information protects us. Our world is changing. We live in a different world now  and what were once individual problems are really now global problems for all of us. Two weeks ago  Afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of power and elected president Ashraf Ghani  which is huge  and I'm very optimistic about him  and I'm hopeful that he'll give Afghanistan the changes that it needs  especially within the legal sector. We live in a different world. We live in a world where my  eight year old daughter only knows a black president. There's a great possibility that our next president will be a woman  and as she gets older  she may question  can a white guy be president  Our world is changing  and  we need to change with it  and what were once individual problems are problems for all of us. According to UNICEF  there are currently over     million boys and girls who are married under the age of   . Two hundred and eighty million. Child marriages prolong the vicious cycle of poverty  poor health  lack of education. At the age of     Sahar was married. She was forced into this marriage and sold by her brother. When she went to her in laws' house  they forced her into prostitution. Because she refused  she was tortured. She was severely beaten with metal rods. They burned her body. They tied her up in a basement and starved her. They used pliers to take out her fingernails. At one point  she managed to escape from this torture chamber to a neighbor's house  and when she went there  instead of protecting her  they dragged her back to her husband's house  and she was tortured even worse. When I met first Sahar  thankfully  Women for Afghan Women gave her a safe haven to go to. As a lawyer  I try to be very strong for all my clients  because that's very important to me  but seeing her  how broken and very weak as she was  was very difficult. It took weeks for us to really get to what happened to her when she was in that house  but finally she started opening up to me  and when she opened up  what I heard was she didn't know what her rights were  but she did know she had  a certain level of protection by her government that failed her  and so we were able to talk about what her legal options were. And so we decided to take this case to the Supreme Court. Now  this is extremely significant  because this is the first time that a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan was being represented by a lawyer  a law that's been on the  books for years and years  but until Sahar  had never been used. In addition to this  we also decided to sue for civil damages  again using a law that's never been used  but we used it for her case. So there we were at the Supreme Court arguing in front of    Afghan justices  me as an American female lawyer  and Sahar  a young woman who when I met her couldn't  speak above a whisper. She stood up  she found her voice  and my girl told them that she wanted justice  and she got it. At the end of it all  the court unanimously agreed that her in laws should be arrested for what they did to her  her fucking brother should also be arrested for selling her   and they agreed that she did have a right to civil compensation. What Sahar has shown us is that we can attack existing bad practices by using the laws in the ways that they're intended to be used  and by protecting Sahar  we are protecting ourselves. After having worked in Afghanistan for over six years now  a lot of my family and friends think that what I do looks like this. But in all actuality  what I do looks like this. Now  we can all do something. I'm not saying we should all buy a plane ticket and go to Afghanistan  but we can all be contributors to a global human rights economy. We can create a culture of transparency and accountability to the laws  and make governments more accountable to us  as we are to them. A few months ago  a South African lawyer visited me in my office and he said   I wanted to meet you. I wanted to see what a crazy person looked like.  The laws are ours  and no matter what your ethnicity  nationality  gender  race  they belong to us  and fighting for justice is not an act of insanity. Businesses also need to get with the program. A corporate investment in human rights is a capital gain on your businesses  and whether you're a business  an NGO  or a private citizen  rule  of law benefits all of us. And by working together with a concerted mindset  through the people  public and private sector  we can create a global human rights economy and all become global investors in human rights. And by doing this  we can achieve justness together. Thank you. I came here to show you the Fotokite. It's a tethered  flying camera. But before I do that  I want to tell you a bit about where it came from  what motivated it. So I was born in Russia  and three years ago  in       there were the Russian federal elections. There were massive irregularities reported  and people came out to protest  which was very unlikely for Russia. And no one really knew how significant these protests were  because  for whatever reason  the world media largely ignored it. Now  there was a group of photographers who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby   usually photographing things like the Sphinx  the Pyramids   who happened to be right around the corner  and they flew a camera and they took some snapshots  some panoramas of this demonstration. Just completely independent entity  completely random occurrence  and the image  when I saw it  it really struck me. Here's one of the panoramas. So in a single image  you can really see the scale of this event   just the number of people  the colors  the banners. You just can't consider this insignificant. All in a single image  which was really cool to me. And I think  in the future  journalism and many other professions  there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there  but I think  you wait a few months  a few years  and for many professions  it's really going to be a requirement. And it make sense. It's  such a unique perspective. Nothing really communicates  this scale  for example  in context  in a way that this does. But there are a few hurdles   and they are quite basic and quite fundamental. One is piloting. So for this image  they flew a camera  a five kilogram device with an SLR under it. It's quite heavy  lots of  spinning  sharp things. It's a bit uncomfortable to fly  probably also for the operator. In fact  you can see that on the  back of the pilot's shirt  it says   No questions until landing  in Russian and in English  because people are curious  and they'll go tap you  and then you lose your focus and things happen. And these guys are great. They're professionals  they're really careful in what they do. So in the protests  maybe you noticed  they flew over the river so it was quite safe. But this doesn't necessarily apply to all people and all conditions  so we really have to make piloting easier. The other problem is regulations  or rather  the lack of good regulation. For many good reasons  it's just difficult to come up with common sense laws to regulate flying cameras. So we already have cameras. Everyone here  I'm sure  has a smartphone with a camera  right  There are more and more of them. You hear about people with Google Glass being attacked. You hear about  actually  a drone pilot  a hobbyist  was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach. Here's some personal input I didn't expect. Just yesterday  I was attacked by a guy who claimed that I was filming him. I was checking my email right here   easy way to get input for your talk. But I think there are better solutions. I think we have to defuse the situation. We have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety  accountability issues but still give us that perspective. And this is one potential solution. So this is the Fotokite. Well  let me see  it's a quadrocopter  but what's kind of special  about it is there's a leash. It's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient. And the neat thing about it is  to fly it  there's no joysticks  nothing like this. You just turn it on and you point in the direction that you want to fly. You give it a little twist. That's kind of the way you communicate. And there it goes. So the interaction is super simple. It's like a personal flying pet. It just always maintains a certain angle to you  and if I move around with it  it'll actually follow me naturally. And of course  we can build on top of this. So this leash has some additional electronics. You can turn it on. And now  it's like telling your dog to fly lower  if you have such a dog. So  I can press a button and manipulate it rather easily. So I just shifted its position. And it's really safe. I don't know about you guys in the front row   you have to agree that you feel safer because there is a physical connection. Live demos are hard  right  Things go wrong all the time. But no matter what  this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you. What's more  it tells you immediately that I am the one responsible for this device. You don't have to look for someone controlling it. Now  I can tell you that it's easy a lot  but I think a really good way to prove that is to grab a second one and launch it. And if I can do this on stage live  then I can show each and every one of you in five minutes how to  operate one of these devices. So now we have two eyes in the sky.  Applause  And now the trick is getting them back. So my question now to you is  well  it's a nice solution  it's very accessible  it's safe. What would you use it for  What would you use such a camera for in your life  Thank you. Humanity takes center stage at TED  but I would like to add  a voice for the animals  whose bodies and minds  and spirits shaped us. Some years ago  it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder on an island not far from Vancouver. His name is Jimmy Smith  and he shared a story with me that is told among his people  who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw. Once upon a time  he told me  all animals on Earth were one. Even though they look different on the outside  inside  they're all the same  and from time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity. When they arrived  they would all take off their skins. Raven shed his feathers  bear his fur  and salmon her scales  and then  they would dance. But one day  a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw because he did not understand. Embarrassed  the animals fled  and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way. The ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities  all animals are one  has been a powerful inspiration to me. I like to get past the fur  the feathers and the scales. I want to get under the skin. No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog  my goal is to connect us with them  eye to eye. You may wonder  do I ever photograph people  Sure. People are always present in my photos  no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions. You just have to learn how  to look past their disguise. As a photographer  I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thing. When I use my camera  I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are. As animals blessed with the power of rational thought  we can marvel at the intricacies of life. As citizens of a planet in trouble  it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life. But as humans with hearts  we can all rejoice in the unity of life  and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave. Let's find a way to join the dance. Thank you. I just met you on a bus  and we would really like  to get to know each other  but I've got to get off at the next stop  so you're going to tell me  three things about yourself that just define you as a person  three things about yourself that will help me understand who you are  three things that just  get to your very essence. And what I'm wondering is  of those three things  is any one of them surviving some kind of trauma  Cancer survivor  rape survivor  Holocaust survivor  incest survivor. Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves by our wounds  And where I have seen this survivor identity have the most consequences is in the cancer community. And I've been around this  community for a long time  because I've been a hospice  and a hospital chaplain for almost    years. And in       I was working at a big cancer center when I received the news that my mother had breast cancer. And then five days later  I received the news that I had breast cancer. My mother and I can be competitive   but I was really not trying to compete with her on this one. And in fact  I thought  well  if you have to have cancer  it's pretty convenient to be working at a place that treats it. But this is what I heard from  a lot of outraged people. What  You're the chaplain. You should be immune. Like  maybe I should have just gotten off with a warning instead of an actual ticket  because I'm on the force. So I did get my treatment at the cancer center where I worked  which was amazingly convenient  and I had chemotherapy and a mastectomy  and a saline implant put in  and so before I say another word  let me just say right now  this is the fake one.  Laughter  I have found that I need to get that out of the way  because I'll see somebody go  Oh  I know it's this one.  And then I'll move or I'll  gesture and they'll go   No  it's that one.  So now you know. I learned a lot being a patient  and one of the surprising things was that only a small part of the cancer experience is about medicine. Most of it is about feelings and faith and losing and finding your identity and discovering strength and flexibility you never even knew you had. It's about realizing that the most important things in life are not things at all  but relationships  and it's about laughing in the face of uncertainty and learning that the way to get out of almost anything is to say   I have cancer.  So the other thing I learned was that I don't have to take on  cancer survivor  as my identity  but  boy  are there powerful forces pushing me to do just that. Now  don't  please  misunderstand me. Cancer organizations and the drive for early screening and cancer awareness and cancer research have normalized cancer  and this is a wonderful thing. We can now talk about cancer without whispering. We can talk about cancer and we can support one another. But sometimes  it feels like people go a little overboard and they start telling us how we're going to feel. So about a week after my surgery  we had a houseguest. That was probably our first mistake. And keep in mind that at this point in my life I had been a chaplain for over    years  and issues like dying and death and the meaning of life  these are all things I'd been  yakking about forever. So at dinner that night  our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head  and say   You know  Deb  now you're really going to learn what's important. Yes  you are going to make some big changes in your life  and now you're going to start thinking about your death. Yep  this cancer is your wakeup call.  Now  these are golden words coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience  but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel  it's instant crap. The only reason I did not kill him with my bare hands was because I could not lift my right arm. But I did say a really bad word to him  followed by a regular word  that   made my husband say   She's on narcotics.  And then after my treatment  it just felt like everyone was telling me what my experience was going to mean.  Oh  this means you're going to be doing the walk.   Oh  this means you're coming to the luncheon.   This means you're going to be wearing the pink ribbon and the pink t shirt and the headband and the earrings and the bracelet and the panties.  Panties. No  seriously  google it. How is that raising awareness  Only my husband should be seeing my panties. He's pretty aware of cancer already. It was at that point where I felt like  oh my God  this is just taking over my life. And that's when I told myself   claim your experience. Don't let it claim you. We all know that the way to cope with trauma  with loss  with any life changing experience  is to find meaning. But here's the thing  No one can tell us what our experience means. We have to decide what it means. And it doesn't have to be some gigantic  extroverted meaning. We don't all have to start a foundation or an organization or write a book or make a documentary. Meaning can be quiet and introverted. Maybe we make one small decision about our lives that can bring about big change. Many years ago  I had a patient  just a wonderful young man who was loved by the staff  and so it was something of a shock to us to realize that he had no friends. He lived by himself  he would come in for chemotherapy by himself  he would receive his treatment  and then he'd walk home alone. And I even asked him. I said   Hey  how come you never bring a friend with you   And he said   I don't really have any friends.  But he had tons of friends on the infusion floor. We all loved him  and people were going in and out of his room all the time. So at his last chemo  we sang him the song and we put the crown on his  head and we blew the bubbles  and then I asked him  I said   So what are you going to do now   And he answered   Make friends.  And he did. He started volunteering  and he made friends there  and he began going to a church and he made friends there  and at Christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment  and the place was filled with his friends. Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you. He decided that the meaning of his experience was to know the joy of friendship  and then learn to make friends. So what about you  How are you going to find meaning in your crappy experience  It could be a recent one  or it could be one that you've been carrying around for a really long time. It's never too late to change what it means  because meaning is dynamic. What it means today may not be what it means a year from now  or    years from now. It's never too late to become someone other than simply a survivor. Hear how static that word sounds  Survivor. No movement  no growth. Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you  because if you do  I believe you will become trapped  you will not grow  you will not evolve. But of course  sometimes it's not outside pressures that cause us to take on that identity of survivor. Sometimes we just like the perks. Sometimes there's a payoff. But then we get stuck. Now  one of the first things I learned as a chaplain intern was the three C's of the chaplain's job  Comfort  clarify and  when necessary  confront or challenge. Now  we all pretty much love the comforting and the clarifying. The confronting  not so much. One of the other things that I loved about being a chaplain was seeing patients a year  or even several years after their treatment  because it was just really cool to see  how they had changed and how their lives had evolved and what had happened to them. So I was thrilled one day to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic from a patient who I had seen the year before  and she was there with her two adult daughters  who I also knew  for her one year follow up exam. So I got down to the lobby  and they were ecstatic because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was NED  No Evidence of Disease. Which I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead. So they were ecstatic  we sat down to visit  and it was so weird  because within two minutes  she  started retelling me the story of her diagnosis and her  surgery and her chemo  even though  as her chaplain   I saw her every week  and so I knew this story. And she was using words like suffering  agony  struggle. And she ended her story with   I felt crucified.  And at that point  her two  daughters got up and said   We're going to go get coffee.  And they left. Tell me three things about yourself before the next stop. People were leaving the bus before she even got to number two or number three. So I handed her a tissue  and I gave her a hug  and then  because I really cared for this woman  I said   Get down off your cross.  And she said   What   And I repeated   Get down off your cross.  And to her credit  she could  talk about her reasons for embracing and then clinging to this identity. It got her a lot of attention. People were taking care of her for a change. But now  it was having the opposite effect. It was pushing people away. People kept leaving to get coffee. She felt crucified by her experience  but she didn't want to let that crucified self die. Now  perhaps you are thinking I was a little harsh with her  so I must tell you that I was speaking out of my own experience. Many  many years before  I had been fired from a job that I loved  and I would not stop talking about my innocence and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt  until finally  just like this woman  people were walking away from me  until I finally realized I wasn't just processing my feelings  I was feeding them. I didn't want to let that crucified self die. But we all know that with any resurrection story  you have to die first. The Christian story  Jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb before he was resurrected. And I believe that for us  being in the tomb means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds and allowing ourselves to be healed. We have to let that crucified self die so that a new self  a truer self  is born. We have to let that old story go so that a new story  a truer story  can be told. Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you. What if there were no survivors  meaning  what if people decided to just claim their trauma as an experience instead of taking it on as an identity  Maybe it would be the end of being trapped in our wounds and the beginning of amazing self exploration and discovery and growth. Maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves by who we have become and who we are becoming. So perhaps survivor was not one of the three things that you would tell me. No matter. I just want you all to know that I am really glad that we are on this bus together  and this is my stop. So this is Anna Hazare  and Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting edge digital activist in the world today. And you wouldn't know it by looking at him. Hazare is a    year old Indian  anticorruption and social justice activist. And in       he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in India  a topic that Indian elites love to ignore. So as part of this campaign  he was using all of the traditional tactics that a good Gandhian organizer would use. So he was on a hunger strike  and Hazare realized through his hunger that actually maybe this time  in the   st century  a hunger strike wouldn't be enough. So he started playing around  with mobile activism. So the first thing he did  is he said to people   Okay  why don't you send me a text message if you support my campaign against corruption   So he does this  he  gives people a short code  and about        people do it. Okay  that's pretty respectable. But then he decides   Let me tweak my tactics a little bit.  He says   Why don't you leave me a missed call   Now  for those of you who have lived in the global South  you'll know that missed calls are a really critical part of global mobile culture. I see people nodding. People leave missed calls all the time  If you're running late for a meeting and you just want to let them know that you're on the way  you leave them a missed call. If you're dating someone and  you just want to say  I miss you  you leave them a missed call. So a note for a dating tip here  in some cultures  if you want to please your lover  you call them and hang up.  Laughter  So why do people leave missed calls  Well  the reason of course is that they're trying to avoid charges associated with making calls and sending texts. So when Hazare asked people  to leave him a missed call  let's have a little guess how  many people actually did this  Thirty five million. So this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history. It's remarkable. And this reflects the extraordinary strength  of the emerging Indian middle class and the power that their mobile phones bring. But he used that  Hazare ended up with this massive  CSV file of mobile phone numbers  and he used that to deploy real people power on the ground to get hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets in Delhi to make a national point of  everyday corruption in India. It's a really striking story. So this is me when I was    years old. I hope you see the resemblance. And I was also an activist  and I have been an activist all my life. I had this really funny childhood where I traipsed around the world meeting world leaders and  Noble prize winners  talking about Third World debt  as it was then called  and demilitarization. I was a very  very serious child.  Laughter  And back then  in the early '  s  I had a very cutting edge tech tool of my own  the fax. And the fax was the  tool of my activism. And at that time  it was the best way to get a message to a lot of people all at once. I'll give you one example of a fax campaign that I ran. It was the eve of the Gulf War and I organized a global campaign  to flood the hotel  the Intercontinental in Geneva  where James Baker and Tariq Aziz were meeting on the eve of the war  and I thought if I could  flood them with faxes  we'll stop the war. Well  unsurprisingly  that campaign was wholly unsuccessful. There are lots of reasons for that  but there's no doubt that  one sputtering fax machine in Geneva was a little bit of a bandwidth constraint in terms of the ability to  get a message to lots of people. And so  I went on to  discover some better tools. I cofounded Avaaz  which uses the  Internet to mobilize people and now has almost     million members  and I now run Purpose  which  is a home for these kinds of technology powered movements. So what's the moral of this story  Is the moral of this story  you know what  the fax is kind of eclipsed by the mobile phone  This is another story of  tech determinism  Well  I would argue that there's  actually more to it than that. I'd argue that in the last    years  something more fundamental has changed than just new tech. I would argue that there has been a fundamental shift in the balance of power in the world. You ask any activist how  to understand the world  and they'll say   Look at where the power is  who has it  how it's shifting.  And I think we all sense that  something big is happening. So Henry Timms and I   Henry's a fellow movement builder   got talking one day and  we started to think  how can we make sense of this new world  How can we describe it and give it a framework that makes it more useful  Because we realized that many of the lessons that we were discovering in movements actually applied all over the world in many sectors of our society. So I want to introduce you to this framework  Old power  meet new power. And I want to talk to you about what new power is today. New power is the deployment of mass participation  and peer coordination   these are the two key elements   to create change and shift outcomes. And we see new power all around us. This is Beppe Grillo he was a populist Italian blogger who  with a minimal political apparatus and only some online tools  won more than    percent of the vote in recent Italian elections. This is Airbnb  which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel industry without owning a single square foot of real estate. This is Kickstarter  which we know has raised over a billion dollars from more than five million people. Now  we're familiar with all of these models. But what's striking is the commonalities  the structural features of  these new models and how they differ from old power. Let's look a little bit at this. Old power is held like a currency. New power works like a current. Old power is held by a few. New power isn't held by a few  it's made by many. Old power is all about download  and new power uploads. And you see a whole set of  characteristics that you can trace  whether it's in media or  politics or education. So we've talked a little bit  about what new power is. Let's  for a second  talk about  what new power isn't. New power is not your Facebook page. I assure you that having a  social media strategy can enable you to do just as much download as you used to do when you had the radio. Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad  I assure you that his Facebook page has not embraced the power of participation. New power is not inherently positive. In fact  this isn't an normative argument that we're making  there are many good things  about new power  but it can produce bad outcomes. More participation  more peer coordination  sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things  like things  for example   in the medical profession that we want new power  to get nowhere near. And thirdly  new power is not the inevitable victor. In fact  unsurprisingly  as many of these new power models get to scale  what you see is this massive pushback from the forces of old power. Just look at this really  interesting epic struggle going on right now between  Edward Snowden and the NSA. You'll note that only one of  the two people on this slide is currently in exile. And so  it's not at all clear that new power will be  the inevitable victor. That said  keep one thing in mind  We're at the beginning of a very steep curve. So you think about some of  these new power models  right  These were just like someone's garage idea a few years ago  and now they're disrupting  entire industries. And so  what's interesting about new power  is the way it feeds on itself. Once you have an experience of new power  you tend to expect and  want more of it. So let's say you've used a peer to peer lending platform like Lending Tree or Prosper  then you've figured out that you don't need the bank  and who wants the bank  right  And so  that experience tends  to embolden you it tends to make you want more participation across more aspects of your life. And what this gives rise to is a set of values. We talked about the models that new power has engendered   the Airbnbs  the Kickstarters. What about the values  And this is an early sketch at what new power values look like. New power values prize transparency above all else. It's almost a religious  belief in transparency  a belief that if you shine  a light on something  it will be better. And remember that in the   th  century  this was not at all true. People thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors and make comfortable agreements. New power values of informal  networked governance. New power folks would never  have invented the U.N. today  for better or worse. New power values participation  and new power is all about do it yourself. In fact  what's interesting  about new power is that it eschews some of  the professionalization and specialization that was all the rage in the   th century. So what's interesting about these new power values and these new power models is what they mean for organizations. So we've spent a bit of time thinking  how can we plot organizations on a two by two where  essentially  we look at new power values and new power models and see where different people sit  We started with a U.S. analysis  and let me show you  some interesting findings. So the first is Apple. In this framework  we actually described Apple as an old power company. That's because the ideology  the governing ideology of Apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in Cupertino. It's absolutely about that beautiful   perfect thing descending upon us in perfection. And it does not value  as a  company  transparency. In fact  it's very secretive. Now  Apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world. So this shows that you can still pursue a successful  old power strategy. But one can argue that there's  real vulnerabilites in that model. I think another interesting comparison is that of the Obama campaign versus the Obama presidency. Now  I like President Obama  but he ran with new  power at his back  right  And he said to people  we are the ones we've been waiting for. And he used crowdfunding to power a campaign. But when he got into office  he governed like more or less  all the other presidents did. And this is a really interesting trend  is when new power gets powerful  what happens  So this is a framework you  should look at and think about where your own organization sits on it. And think about where it should be in five or    years. So what do you do if you're old power  Well  if you're there  thinking  in old power  this won't happen to us. Then just look at the Wikipedia entry for Encyclop dia Britannica. Let me tell you  it's a very sad read. But if you are old power  the most important thing you  can do is to occupy yourself before others occupy you  before you are occupied. Imagine that a group of your biggest skeptics are camped in the heart of your organization asking the toughest questions and they can see everything inside of your organization. And ask them  would they  like what they see and should our model change  What about if you're new power  Is new power kind of just  riding the wave to glory  I would argue no. I would argue that there are some very real challenges to new power in this nascent phase. Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street example for a moment. Occupy was this incredible example  of new power  the purest example of new power. And yet  it failed to consolidate. So the energy that it created was great for the meme phase  but they were so committed to participation  that they never got anything done. And in fact that model means that the challenge for new power is  how do you use institutional power without being institutionalized  One the other end of the spectra is Uber. Uber is an amazing  highly scalable new power model. That network is getting denser and denser by the day. But what's really interesting  about Uber is it hasn't really adopted new power values. This is a real quote from  the Uber CEO recently  He says   Once we get rid of the dude  in the car    he means drivers    Uber will be cheaper.  Now  new power models live and die by the strength of their networks. By whether the drivers and the consumers who use the service actually believe in it. Because they're not an exercise  of top down perfectionism  they are about the network. And so  the challenge  and this is why it's in no way surprising  is that Uber's drivers  are now unionizing. It's extraordinary. Uber's drivers are turning on Uber. And the challenge for Uber   this isn't an easy situation for them   is that they are locked into a broader superstrcuture that is really old power. They've raised more than a billion  dollars in the capital markets. Those markets expect a financial return  and they way you get a financial return is by squeezing and squeezing your users and your drivers for more and more value and giving that value to your investors. So the big question about the future  of new power  in my view  is  Will that old power just emerge  So will new power elites just become old power and squeeze  Or will that new power base bite back  Will the next big Uber be co owned by Uber drivers  And I think this going  to be a very interesting structural question. Finally  think about new power being more than just an entity that scales things that make us have slightly  better consumer experiences. My call to action for new power is to not be an island. We have major structural problems in the world today that could benefit enormously from the kinds of mass participation and peer coordination that these new power players know so well how to generate. And we badly need them to  turn their energies and their power to big  what economists might call public goods problems  that are often beyond markets where investors can easily be found. And I think if we can do that  we might be able to fundamentally change not only human beings' sense of  their own agency and power   because I think that's the most wonderful thing about new power  is that people feel more powerful   but we might also be able to change the way we relate to each other and the way we relate to  authority and institutions. And to me  that's absolutely worth trying for. Thank you very much.
