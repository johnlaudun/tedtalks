Chris Anderson  Thank you so much  Prime Minister  that was both fascinating and quite inspiring. So  you're calling for a global ethic. Would you describe that as global citizenship  Is that an idea that you believe in  and how would you define that  Gordon Brown  It is about global citizenship and recognizing our responsibilities to others. There is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world. And there is so much shared sense of what we need to do  that it is vital that we all come together. But we don't necessarily have the means to do so. So there are challenges to be met. I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents. But of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work. But I don't think we should underestimate the extent to which massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people across the world. CA  But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship  but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism  and how to combine these two. I mean  you're elected as Prime Minister with a brief to bat for Britain. How do you reconcile the two things  GB  Well  of course national identity remains important. But it's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities. And I think one of the problems of recession is that people become more protectionist  they look in on themselves  they try to protect their own nation  perhaps at the expense of other nations. When you actually look at the motor of the world economy  it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries. And any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years would deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits of growth in the world economy. So  you've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism  that's absolutely important. But you've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally  and the problems we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone. CA  Well  indeed. But what do you do when the two come into conflict and you're forced to make a decision that either is in Britain's interest  or the interest of Britons  or citizens elsewhere in the world  GB  Well I think we can persuade people that what is necessary for Britain's long term interests  what is necessary for America's long term interests  is proper engagement with the rest of the world  and taking the action that is necessary. There is a great story  again  told about Richard Nixon.       Ghana becomes independent  so it is just over    years ago. Richard Nixon goes to represent the United States government at the celebrations for independence in Ghana. And it's one of his first outings as Vice President to an African country. He doesn't quite know what to do  so he starts going around the crowd and starts talking to people and he says to people in this rather unique way   How does it feel to be free   And he's going around   How does it feel to be free    How does it feel to be free   And then someone says   How should I know  I come from Alabama.  And that was the     s. Now  what is remarkable is that civil rights in America were achieved in the     s. But what is equally remarkable is socioeconomic rights in Africa have not moved forward very fast even since the age of colonialism. And yet  America and Africa have got a common interest. And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa  to work together for common causes  then the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups making progress in Africa is very big. So  I would say that what seems sometimes to be altruism  in relation to Africa  or in relation to developing countries  is more than that. It is enlightened self interest for us to work with other countries. And I would say that national interest and  if you like  what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change do  in the long run  come together. And whatever the short run price for taking action on climate change or on security  or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education  these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries. CA  I still just want to draw out on this issue. So  you're on vacation at a nice beach  and word comes through that there's been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach. One end of the beach  there is a house containing a family of five Nigerians. And at the other end of the beach there is a single Brit. You have time to    you have time to alert one house. What do you do  GB  Modern communications. Alert both. I do agree that my responsibility is first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe. And I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each leader has for their own country. But I'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before. But the power to communicate across borders allows us to organize the world in a different way. And I think  look at the tsunami  it's a classic example. Where was the early warning systems  Where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes  as well as the potential for climate change  And when the world starts to work together  with better early warning systems  you can deal with some of these problems in a better way. I just think we're not seeing  at the moment  the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems. CA  But I think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot of people have  like people in the audience here  where we love the kind of language that you're talking about. It is inspiring. A lot of us believe that that has to be the world's future. And yet  when the situation changes  you suddenly hear politicians talking as if  you know  for example  the life of one American soldier is worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians. When the pedal hits the metal  the idealism can get moved away. I'm just wondering whether you can see that changing over time  whether you see in Britain that there are changing attitudes  and that people are actually more supportive of the kind of global ethic that you talk about. GB  I think every religion  every faith  and I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion    it has this global ethic at the center of its credo. And whether it's Jewish or whether it's Muslim or whether it's Hindu  or whether it's Sikh  the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions. So  I think you're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of their moral sense. So you're building on something that is not pure self interest. You're building on people's ideas and values    that perhaps they're candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions. But it is a set of values that cannot  in my view  be extinguished. Then the question is  how do you make that change happen  How do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong    After the Second World War  we built institutions  the United Nations  the IMF  the World Bank  the World Trade Organization  the Marshall Plan. There was a period in which people talked about an act of creation  because these institutions were so new. But they are now out of date. They don't deal with the problems. You can't deal with the environmental problem through existing institutions. You can't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to. You can't deal with the economic and financial problem. So we have got to rebuild our global institutions  build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time. And I believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face  it is to persuade people to have the confidence that we can build a truly global society with the institutions that are founded on these rules. So  I come back to my initial point. Sometimes you think things are impossible. Nobody would have said    years ago that apartheid would have gone in       or that the Berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the '  s and '  s  or that polio could be eradicated  or perhaps    years ago  nobody would have said a man could gone to the Moon. All these things have happened. By tackling the impossible  you make the impossible possible. CA  And we have had a speaker who said that very thing  and swallowed a sword right after that  which was quite dramatic. GB  Followed my sword and swallow. CA  But  surely a true global ethic is for someone to say   I believe that the life of every human on the planet is worth the same  equal consideration  regardless of nationality and religion.  And you have politicians who have    you're elected. In a way  you can't say that. Even if  as a human being  you believe that  you can't say that. You're elected for Britain's interests. GB  We have a responsibility to protect. I mean look        the Treaty of Versailles  and all the treaties before that  the Treaty of Westphalia and everything else  were about protecting the sovereign right of countries to do what they want. Since then  the world has moved forward  partly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust  and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection  partly because of what we saw in Rwanda  partly because of what we saw in Bosnia. The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world. So  while I can't automatically say that Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country  in danger  I can say that Britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack  is something that is accepted by the whole world. Now  in the end  that can only be achieved if your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so. And that comes back to what the future role of the United Nations  and what it can do  actually is. But  the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is  in a sense  taken over from the idea of self determination as the principle governing the international community. CA  Can you picture  in our lifetimes  a politician ever going out on a platform of the kind of full form global ethic  global citizenship  And basically saying   I believe that all people across the planet have equal consideration  and if in power we will act in that way. And we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that ethic.  GB  Is that not what we're doing in the debate about climate change  We're saying that you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country  you've got to involve all countries. You're saying that you must  and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves. You're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we're all bound together to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world. We've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work. If you could get a deal at Copenhagen  where people agreed  A  that there was a long term target for carbon emission cuts  B  that there was short range targets that had to be met so this wasn't just abstract  it was people actually making decisions now that would make a difference now  and if you could then find a financing mechanism that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt by our inability to deal with climate change over many  many years and decades are given special help so that they can move to energy efficient technologies  and they are in a position financially to be able to afford the long term investment that is associated with cutting carbon emissions  then you are treating the world equally  by giving consideration to every part of the planet and the needs they have. It doesn't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing  because we've actually got to do more financially to help the poorest countries  but it does mean there is equal consideration for the needs of citizens in a single planet. CA  Yes. And then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests. GB  Yes  but I think Europe has got a position  which is    countries have already come together. I mean  the great difficulty in Europe is if you're at a meeting and    people speak  it takes a very  very long time. But we did get an agreement on climate change. America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that President Obama should be congratulated for getting through Congress. Japan has made an announcement. China and India have signed up to the scientific evidence. And now we've got to move them to accept a long term target  and then short term targets. But more progress has been made  I think  in the last few weeks than had been made for some years. And I do believe that there is a strong possibility that if we work together  we can get that agreement to Copenhagen. I certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs. And we would help them adapt. And we would help them make the transition to a low carbon economy. I do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this. When the IMF was created in the     s  it was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world's GDP. The IMF now has limited resources  one percent. It can't really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis. So  we've got to rebuild the world institutions. And that's a big task  persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so. There is a story told about the three world leaders of the day getting a chance to get some advice from God. And the story is told that Bill Clinton went to God and he asked when there will be successful climate change and a low carbon economy. And God shook his head and said   Not this year  not this decade  perhaps not even in  your  lifetime.  And Bill Clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted. And then the story is that Barroso  the president of the European Commission  went to God and he asked   When will we get a recovery of global growth   And God said   Not this year  not in this decade  perhaps not in your lifetime.  So Barroso walked away crying and in tears. And then the Secretary General of the United Nations came up to speak to God and said   When will our international institutions work   And God cried. It is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions is the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves that there is a clear ethic upon which we can build. CA  Prime Minister  I think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into. And there are certainly many people in the audience who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic. Thank you so much for coming to TED. GB  Well  thank you. How do you observe something you can't see  This is the basic question of somebody who's interested in finding and studying black holes. Because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it  not even light  so you can't see it directly. So  my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole. I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive  what we like to call  supermassive  black hole at the center of our galaxy. And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist. And second  it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment  and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in. So  to begin with  we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole. So  what is a black hole  Well  in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object  because there are only three characteristics that you can describe  the mass  the spin  and the charge. And I'm going to only talk about the mass. So  in that sense  it's a very simple object. But in another sense  it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe  and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe. But today  the way I want you to understand a black hole  for the proof of a black hole  is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume. So  despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive  and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment  it has no finite size. So  this is a little tricky. But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see  and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius. And that's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius. This is a virtual radius  not reality  the black hole has no size. So why is it so important  It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole. That means you  your neighbor  your cellphone  the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius. At that point  what's going to happen  At that point gravity wins. Gravity wins over all other known forces. And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object. And then it's a black hole. So  if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube  it would become a black hole  because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius. Now  the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is. And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out. It depends only on the mass of the object. Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii. Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii. So  if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford  it would become a black hole. So  now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is. And it's actually quite a useful concept  because it tells us not only when a black hole will form  but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole. I only need two things. I need to understand the mass of the object I'm claiming is a black hole  and what its Schwarzschild radius is. And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius  there is actually only one thing I really need to know. So  my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius. And your job today is to be skeptical. Okay  so  I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole  I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes. So  I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is  as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole. An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life. So  if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun  it's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here. And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun. On an astronomical scale that's a very small black hole. Now  what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes. And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies. And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes. There are big ones. There are little ones. Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy. And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left. And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy  just to give you a sense of scale. And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy  which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here  comes from the light from the stars. So  we see the galaxy because of the star light. Now  there are a few relatively exotic galaxies. I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world  because they are kind of show offs. And we call them active galactic nuclei. And we call them that because their nucleus  or their center  are very active. So  at the center there  that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from. And yet  what we actually see is light that can't be explained by the starlight. It's way more energetic. In fact  in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here. There are also jets emanating out from the center. Again  a source of energy that's very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars. So  what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to. So  you can't see the black hole itself  but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see. So  there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies. But it's a kind of indirect argument. Nonetheless  it's given rise to the notion that maybe it's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes  but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers. And if that's the case    and this is an example of a normal galaxy  what we see is the star light. And if there is a supermassive black hole  what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet. Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei. If we're going to look for these stealth black holes at the center of galaxies  the best place to look is in our own galaxy  our Milky Way. And this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the Milky Way. And what we see is a line of stars. And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened  disk like structure. And we live in the middle of it  so when we look towards the center  we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy  or line that defines the plane of the galaxy. Now  the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we're ever going to have  because the next closest galaxy is     times further away. So  we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else. And as you'll see in a moment  the ability to see detail is key to this experiment. So  how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume  Which is the job that I have to show you today. And the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole. Stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun. It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit. If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off  or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit. So  this is great  because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume. So  if I know how fast it goes around  I know the mass. And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius. So  I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible. Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible. So  this means that I want to see a lot of detail. And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope. This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror    meters  which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court. Now  this is wonderful  because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope  the smaller the detail that we can see. But it turns out these telescopes  or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise. And that is because of the atmosphere. Atmosphere is great for us  it allows us to survive here on Earth. But it's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources. So  to give you a sense of what this is like  it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream. Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream  the stream is continuously moving and turbulent  and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream. Very much in the same way  it's very difficult to see astronomical sources  because of the atmosphere that's continuously moving by. So  I've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere  to give us a cleaner view. And that buys us about a factor of   . And I think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of     you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot  say your salary  you'd notice  or your kids  you'd notice. And this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use  called adaptive optics. You're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique    in other words  just a picture that shows the stars    and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy  where we think the black hole is. So  without this technology you can't see the stars. With this technology all of a sudden you can see it. This technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you. So  it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope. Now  in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there. So  we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square  although we've looked at all of them. So  I want to see how these things have moved. And over the course of this experiment  these stars have moved a tremendous amount. So  we've been doing this experiment for    years  and we see the stars go all the way around. Now  most astronomers have a favorite star  and mine today is a star that's labeled up there  SO  . Absolutely my favorite star in the world. And that's because it goes around in only    years. And to give you a sense of how short that is  the sun takes     million years to go around the center of the galaxy. Stars that we knew about before  that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible  take     years. And this one  this one goes around in a human lifetime. That's kind of profound  in a way. But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius. So  next we see a picture here that shows you before this experiment the size to which we could confine the mass of the center of the galaxy. What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle. And as you can see  there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle. You can see a lot of stars. So  there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy  because you could put a lot of stuff in there. But with this experiment  we've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that's        times smaller. And because of that  we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there. To give you a sense of how small that size is  that's the size of our solar system. So  we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume. Now  truth in advertising. Right  I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius. And the truth is  I'm not quite there. But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass. And  in fact  it's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy  but any in our universe. So  what next  I actually think this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology  so let's move on with the problem. So  what I want to tell you  very briefly  is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy  now that we know that there is  or at least we believe  that there is a supermassive black hole there. And the fun phase of this experiment is  while we've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy  almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see. And that's the fun. So  let me give you the two examples. You can ask   What do you expect for the old stars  stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time  they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.  What you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole. You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole. Likewise  for the young stars  or in contrast  the young stars  they just should not be there. A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery. To get a star to form  you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse. And it's a very fragile entity. And what does the big black hole do  It strips that gas cloud apart. It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart. In fact  we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment. So  you shouldn't see young stars. So  what do we see  Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today  we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young. The old ones are red. The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones  we don't know yet. So  you can already see the surprise. There is a dearth of old stars. There is an abundance of young stars  so it's the exact opposite of the prediction. So  this is the fun part. And in fact  today  this is what we're trying to figure out  this mystery of how do you get    how do you resolve this contradiction. So  in fact  my graduate students are  at this very moment  today  at the telescope  in Hawaii  making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage  where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars  and so few old stars. To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away. To do that we'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today. Because  in truth  while I said we're correcting for the Earth's atmosphere  we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced. We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere  and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest. So this is what we hope to do in the next few years. And on a much longer time scale  what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes  because  remember  bigger is better in astronomy. So  we want to build a    meter telescope. And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy. And we hope to be able to test some of Einstein's theories of general relativity  some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form. So  we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting. So  in conclusion  I'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving  in three dimensions. And I hope  if nothing else  I've convinced you that  one  we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. And this means that these things do exist in our universe  and we have to contend with this  we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world. Second  we've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact  and understand  maybe  the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are  and how they work. And last but not least  none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that's been made on the technology front. And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast  and holds a lot in store for the future. Thanks very much. For emotions  we should not move quickly to the desert. So  first  a small housekeeping announcement  please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain. So  welcome to the Golden Desert  Indian desert. It receives the least rainfall in the country  lowest rainfall. If you are well versed with inches  nine inches  centimeters      centimeters . The groundwater is     feet deep      meters. And in most parts it is saline  not fit for drinking. So  you can't install hand pumps or dig wells  though there is no electricity in most of the villages. But suppose you use the green technology  solar pumps    they are of no use in this area. So  welcome to the Golden Desert. Clouds seldom visit this area. But we find    different names of clouds in this dialect used here. There are a number of techniques to harvest rain. This is a new work  it's a new program. But for the desert society this is no program  this is their life. And they harvest rain in many ways. So  this is the first device they use in harvesting rain. It's called kunds  somewhere it is called  unclear . And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment. The desert is there  sand dunes  some small field. And this is all big raised platform. You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment  and there is a slope. Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms  but here they will care properly. And the water will go where it should go. And then it is    feet deep. The waterproofing is done perfectly  better than our city contractors  because not a single drop should go waste in this. They collect     thousand liters in one season. And this is pure drinking water. Below the surface there is hard saline water. But now you can have this for year round. It's two houses. We often use a term called bylaws. Because we are used to get written things. But here it is unwritten by law. And people made their house  and the water storage tanks. These raised up platforms just like this stage. In fact they go    feet deep  and collect rain water from roof  there is a small pipe  and from their courtyard. It can also harvest something like        in a good monsoon. Another big one  this is of course out of the hardcore desert area. This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort. And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. The age is     years. So  since     years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season. You can calculate the price of that water. It draws water from    kilometers of canals. You can see a modern road  hardly    years old. It can break sometimes. But this     year old canal  which draws water  it is maintained for so many generations. Of course if you want to go inside  the two doors are locked. But they can be opened for TED people. And we request them. You can see person coming up with two canisters of water. And the water level    these are not empty canisters    water level is right up to this. It can envy many municipalities  the color  the taste  the purity of this water. And this is what they call Zero B type of water  because it comes from the clouds  pure distilled water. We stop for a quick commercial break  and then we come back to the traditional systems. The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas. That's why I said that this is a commercial break. But we will come back  once again  to the traditional thing. So  water from          kilometers away  soon it become like this. In many portions  water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything. Of course there are some areas where water is reaching  I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all. But the tail end  the Jaisalmer area  you will notice in Bikaner things like this  where the water hyacinth couldn't grow  the sand is flowing in these canals. The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. We had full page advertisements  some    years     years ago when this canal came. They said that throw away your traditional systems  these new cement tanks will supply you piped water. It's a dream. And it became a dream also. Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas. And people started renovating their own structures. These are all traditional water structures  which we won't be able to explain in such a short time. But you can see that no woman is standing on those. And they are plaiting hair. Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert. This town was established     years ago. I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there  or Delhi was there  or Chennai was there  or Bangalore was there. So  this was the terminal point for silk route. Well connected      years ago  through Europe. None of us were able to go to Europe  but Jaisalmer was well connected to it. And this is the    centimeter area. Such a limited rainfall  and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. You won't find water in this slide. But it is invisible. Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here. Or  if you want to paint  you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms. But apart from this system  they designed    beautiful water bodies around this town. And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also. So  estate  public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body. And it's a kind of water body for all seasons. You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year. Whether water level goes up or down  the beauty is there throughout. Another water body  dried up  of course  during the summer period  but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics  with the heart. These statues  marvelous statues  gives you an idea of water table. When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank  it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today  mass communication.  This was for mass communication. Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned  so water will be there for seven months or nine months  or    months. And then they will come and worship this pond  pay respect  their gratitude. Another small water body  called the  unclear . It is difficult to translate in English  especially in my English. But the nearest would be  glory   a reputation. The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up. In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up. And perhaps they knew the future also. It was designed some     years ago. But perhaps they knew that on sixth  November        there will be a TED green and blue session  so they painted it like this. Dry water body. Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain. This is called kund. We have  in English  surface water and ground water. But this is not ground water. You can draw ground water from any well. But this is no ordinary well. It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand. And they have dubbed this water as the third one called  unclear . And there is a gypsum belt running below it. And it was deposited by the great mother Earth  some three million years ago. And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water. This is the same dry water body. Now  you don't find any kund  they are all submerged. But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year. This year they have received only six centimeters. Six centimeter of rainfall  and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city  Delhi  Bombay  Bangalore  Mysore  please come to our area of six centimeters  we can give you water. How they maintain them  There are three things  concept  planning  making the actual thing  and also maintaining them. It is a structure for maintain  for centuries  by generations  without any department  without any funding  So the secret is   unclear    respect. Your own thing  not personal property  my property  every time. So  these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area. Don't spit  don't do anything wrong  so that the clean water can be collected. Another pillar  stone pillar on your right side. If you climb these three  six steps you will find something very nice. This was done in   th century. And you have to go further down. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words  so we can say a thousand words right now  an another thousand words. If the water table goes down  you will find new stairs. If it comes up  some of them will be submerged. So  throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure. Three sides  such steps  on the fourth side there is a four story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime. Excuse me  who built these structures  They are in front of you. The best civil engineers we had  the best planners  the best architects. We can say that because of them  because of their forefathers  India could get the first engineering college in     . There were no English medium schools at that time  even no Hindi schools   unclear  schools. But such people  compelled to the East India Company  which came here for business  a very dirty kind of business ... but not to create the engineering colleges. But because of them  first engineering college was created in a small village  not in the town. The last point  we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert. So  you can find through your Jeep  a camel  and a cart. This tire comes from the airplane. So  look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater  and also create something through a tire from a jet plane  and used in a camel cart. Last picture  it's a tattoo        years old tattoo. They were using it on their body. Tattoo was  at one time  a kind of a blacklisted or con thing  but now it is in thing. You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this. The center of life is water. These are the beautiful waves. These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides. These are the trees. And these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives. So  this is the message of desert. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So  first of all  I wish I had your eloquence  truly  in any language. These artifacts and designs are inspiring. Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere  that the world can learn from this  Or is this just right for this place  Anupam Mishra  No  the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area. So  the ponds  the open bodies  are everywhere  right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir  and in other parts also. And these  unclear   which stored water  there are two type of things. One recharge  and one stores. So  it depends on the terrain. But kund  which uses the gypsum belt  for that you have to go back to your calendar  three million years ago. If it is there it can be done right now. Otherwise  it can't be done. CA  Thank you so much. For the last    years I've been designing puzzles. And I'm here today to give you a little tour  starting from the very first puzzle I designed  through what I'm doing now. I've designed puzzles for books  printed things. I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine. I've been doing that for about    years. I have a monthly puzzle calendar. I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games. I did puzzles for  Bejeweled.  I didn't invent  Bejeweled.  I can't take credit for that. So  very first puzzle  sixth grade  my teacher said   Oh  let's see  that guy  he likes to make stuff. I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board.  I thought this was a great assignment. And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it. I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once. The question is  which letter is it if I unfold it  One hint  It's not  L.  It could be an  L   of course. So  what else could it be  Yeah  a lot of you got it. Oh yeah. So  clever thing. Now  that was my first puzzle. I got hooked. I created something new  I was very excited because  you know  I'd made crossword puzzles  but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix. This was something really original. I got hooked. I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American. Went on  and eventually decided to devote myself  full time  to that. Now  I should pause and say  what do I mean by puzzle  A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer.  Fun to solve   as opposed to everyday problems  which  frankly  are not very well designed puzzles. You know  they might have a solution. It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly. Who designed this  It's like  you know  life is not a very well written story so we have to hire writers to make movies. Well  I take everyday problems  and I make puzzles out of them. And  right answer   of course there might be more than one right answer  many puzzles have more than one. But as opposed to a couple other forms of play  toys and games    by toy I mean  something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal. You can create one out of Legos. You know  you can do anything you want. Or competitive games like chess where  well  you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle  but the goal really is to beat another player. I consider that puzzles are an art form. They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history. It's a very small form  like a joke  a poem  a magic trick or a song  very compact form. At worst  they're throwaways  they're for amusement. But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression. The progression of my career that you'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact. So  one thing I found early on  when I started doing computer games  is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception. I'll show you how. Here is a famous one. So  it's two profiles in black  or a white vase in the middle. This is called a figure ground illusion. The artist M.C. Escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints. Here we have  Day and Night.  Here is what I did with figure and ground. So  here we have  figure  in black. Here we have  figure  in white. And it's all part of the same design. The background to one is the other. Originally I tried to do the words  figure  and  ground.  But I couldn't do that  I realized. I changed the problem. It's all  figure.  A few other things. Here is my name. And that turns into the title of my first book   Inversions.  These sorts of designs now go by the word  ambigram.  I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have the numbers one through     the digits zero through nine  actually. Each letter here is one of these digits. Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense. I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean. Here's the word  mirror.  No  it's not the same upside down. It's the same this way. And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab who just got appointed head of RISD  is John Maeda. And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon. And recently in Magic magazine I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names. So here we have Penn and Teller  same upside down. This appears in my puzzle calendar. Okay  let's go back to the slides. Thank you very much. Now  those are fun to look at. Now how would you do it interactively  For a while I was an interface designer. And so I think a lot about interaction. Well  let's first of all simplify the vases illusion  make the thing on the right. Now  if you could pick up the black vase  it would look like the figure on top. If you could pick up the white area  it would look like the figure on the bottom. Well  you can't do that physically  but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C. And here it is  figure ground. The goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right. And this follows the rules I just said  any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up. But that is also true of any white area. So  here we got the white area in the middle  and you can pick it up. I'll just go one step further. So  here is    here is a couple pieces. Move them together  and now this is an active piece. You can really get inside somebody's perception and have them experience something. It's like the old maxim of  you can tell somebody something and show them  but if they do it they really learn it.  Here is another thing you can do. There is a game called Rush Hour. This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides Rubik's cube. So  here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place. The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle. It's made by the company Think Fun. It's done very well. I love this puzzle. Well  let's play one. Here. So  here is a very simple puzzle. Well  that's too simple  let's add another piece. Okay  so how would you solve this one  Well  move the blue one out of the way. Here  let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy. Now we'll make it harder  a little harder. Now  this one is a little bit trickier. You know  What do you do here  The first move is going to be what  You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right. And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all. Those four are locked in a pinwheel  you can't get them apart. I wanted to make a sequel. I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way I work as an inventor is to create a sequel. I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour. It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece  a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically. In the other game the cars can only move forward and back. Created a whole bunch of levels for it. Now I'm making it available to schools. And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles  but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science  other areas. So  I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them. Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist. You know  he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon. In Discover Magazine  I'm an investigative puzzle maker. I got interested in gene sequencing. And I said   Well  how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA   Cut up the DNA  you sequence individual pieces  and then you look for overlaps  and you basically match them at the edges. And I said   This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle  except the pieces overlap.  So  here is what I created for Discover Magazine. And it has to be solvable in a magazine. You know  you can't cut out the pieces and move them around. So  here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid. And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge. There is only one solution. It's not that hard. But it takes some persistence. And when you're done  it makes this design  which  if you squint  is the word  helix.  So  that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content  rather than the other way around. Here is a couple more. Here is a physics based puzzle. Which way will these fall  One of these weighs    pounds     pounds and    pounds. And depending on which one weighs which amount  they'll fall different directions. And here is a puzzle based on color mixing. I separated this image into cyan  magenta  yellow  black  the basic printing colors  and then mixed up the separations  and you get these peculiar pictures. Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures  Gets you thinking about color. Finally  what I'm doing now. So  ShuffleBrain.com  website you can go visit  I joined up with my wife  Amy Jo Kim. She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work. So  we're making smart games for social media. I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends. This is what's going on in the games industry right now. First of all  you know  for a long time computer games meant things like  Doom   where you're going around shooting things  very violent games  very fast  aimed at teenage boys. Right  That's who plays computer games. Well  guess what  That's changing.  Bejeweled  is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open what's called casual games. And the main players are over     and are female. Then recently  Rock Band  has been a big hit. And it's a game you play with other people. It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game. This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming. Now  within that there is some interesting things happening. There is also a trend towards games that are good for you. Why  Well  we aging Boomers  Baby Boomers  we're eating our healthy food  we're exercising. What about our minds  Oh no  our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something. Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's. So  we got games like  Brain Age  coming out for the Nintendo DS  huge hit. A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it. And then there is social media  and what's happening on the Internet. Everybody now considers themselves a creator  and not just a viewer. And what does this add up to  Here is what we see coming. It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle. They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing. And they are both  something that is good for you  and they're fun. I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media. And we decided to combine our skills. Our first game is called  Photo Grab.  The game takes about a minute and    seconds. This is your first time playing my game. Okay. Let's see how well we can do. There are three images. And we have    seconds each. Where is that  I'll play as fast as I can. But if you can see it  shout out the answer. You get more    Down  okay  yeah where is that  Oh  yeah. There  okay. J O and    I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps. That's his hair. You get a lot of figure ground problems. Yeah  that one is easy. Okay. So  ahhh  Okay on to the next one. Okay  so that's the lens. Anybody  Looks like a black shape. So  where is that  That's the corner of the whole thing. Yeah  I've played this image before  but even when I make up my own puzzles    and you can put your own images in here. And we have people all over the world doing that now. There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com if you want to try it yourself. Thank you. I'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation  the third largest organized crime  a     billion industry. I'm talking to you about modern day slavery. I'd like to tell you the story of these three children  Pranitha  Shaheen and Anjali. Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution  a prostituted person. She got infected with HIV  and towards the end of her life  when she was in the final stages of AIDS  she could not prostitute  so she sold four year old Pranitha to a broker. By the time we got the information  we reached there  Pranitha was already raped by three men. Shaheen's background I don't even know. We found her in a railway track  raped by many  many men  I don't know many. But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body. And when we took her to the hospital she needed    stitches to put back her intestine into her body. We still don't know who her parents are  who she is. All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally. Anjali's father  a drunkard  sold his child for pornography. You're seeing here images of three years  four year olds  and five year old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. In this country  and across the globe  hundreds and thousands of children  as young as three  as young as four  are sold into sexual slavery. But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for. They are sold in the name of adoption. They are sold in the name of organ trade. They are sold in the name of forced labor  camel jockeying  anything  everything. I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. And I tell you stories from there. My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager. I was    when I was gang raped by eight men. I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it. Yes  there were eight men who defiled me  raped me  but that didn't go into my consciousness. I never felt like a victim  then or now. But what lingered from then till now    I am    today    is this huge outrageous anger. Two years  I was ostracized  I was stigmatized  I was isolated  because I was a victim. And that's what we do to all traffic survivors. We  as a society  we have PhDs in victimizing a victim. Right from the age of     when I started looking around me  I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery like practices  but have absolutely no respite  because we don't allow them to come in. Where does their journey begin  Most of them come from very optionless families  not just poor. You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked. I had this I.S. officer's daughter  who is    years old  studying in ninth standard  who was raped chatting with one individual  and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine  who was trafficked. I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well to do families  and children from well to do families  who are getting trafficked. These people are deceived  forced.   .  percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution. Some pay the price for it. They're killed  we don't even hear about them. They are voiceless   unclear   nameless people. But the rest  who succumb into it  go through everyday torture. Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends  or who want to have a family with you. These are men who buy you for an hour  for a day  and use you  throw you. Each of the girls that I have rescued    I have rescued more than       girls    each of them tell me one story in common ... one story about one man  at least  putting chili powder in her vagina  one man taking a cigarette and burning her  one man whipping her. We are living among those men  they're our brothers  fathers  uncles  cousins  all around us. And we are silent about them. We think it is easy money. We think it is shortcut. We think the person likes to do what she's doing. But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections  sexually transmitted infections  HIV  AIDS  syphilis  gonorrhea  you name it  substance abuse  drugs  everything under the sun. And one day she gives up on you and me  because we have no options for her. And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation. She believes   Yes  this is it  this is what my destiny is about.  And this is normal  to get raped by     men a day. And it's abnormal to live in a shelter. It's abnormal to get rehabilitated. It's in that context that I work. It's in that context that I rescue children. I've rescued children as young as three years  and I've rescued women as old as    years. When I rescued them  one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin. Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected. One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive. And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain. And for me  I was my greatest experience. Understanding my own self  understanding my own pain  my own isolation  was my greatest teacher. Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential. You see a girl here who is trained as a welder. She works for a very big company  a workshop in Hyderabad  making furnitures. She earns around        rupees. She is an illiterate girl  trained  skilled as a welder. Why welding and why not computers  We felt  one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage. They did not have any pardas inside their body  hijabs inside themselves  they've crossed the barrier of it. And therefore they could fight in a male dominated world  very easily  and not feel very shy about it. We have trained girls as carpenters  as masons  as security guards  as cab drivers. And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field  gaining confidence  restoring dignity  and building hopes in their own lives. These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram ki construction  as masons  full time masons. What has been my challenge  My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up. I've been beaten up more than    times in my life. I can't hear from my right ear. I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue. My biggest challenge is society. It's you and me. My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own. A very supportive friend of mine  a well wisher of mine  used to give me every month        rupees for vegetables. When her mother fell sick she said   Sunitha  you have so much of contacts. Can you get somebody in my house to work  so that she can look after my mother   And there is a long pause. And then she says   Not one of our girls.  It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking  in this fantastic A C hall. It's very nice for discussion  discourse  making films and everything. But it is not nice to bring them to our homes. It's not nice to give them employment in our factories  our companies. It's not nice for our children to study with their children. There it ends. That's my biggest challenge. If I'm here today  I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan. I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking. They need your compassion. They need your empathy. They need  much more than anything else  your acceptance. Many times when I talk to people  I keep telling them one thing  don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem. Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem  And that's what I'm here for  asking for your support  demanding for your support  requesting for your support. Can you break your culture of silence  Can you speak to at least two persons about this story  Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons. I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings  or Medha Patkars  or something like that. I'm asking you  in your limited world  can you open your minds  Can you open your hearts  Can you just encompass these people too  Because they are also a part of us. They are also part of this world. I'm asking you  for these children  whose faces you see  they're no more. They died of AIDS last year. I'm asking you to help them  accept as human beings    not as philanthropy  not as charity  but as human beings who deserve all our support. I'm asking you this because no child  no human being  deserves what these children have gone through. Thank you. Chris has been so nice. I don't know how you keep it up  Chris  I really don't. So nice  all week. He's the kind of man you could say to   Chris  I'm really sorry  I've crashed your car. And it gets worse  I crashed it into your house. Your house has caught fire. And what's more  your wife has just run off with your best friend.  And you know that Chris would say   Thank you.   Thank you for sharing  that's really interesting.   Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you.  One of the     Applause  Thank you for inviting us. One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that  gradually  as the days go by  all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say. Nuclear fusion  I had about    minutes on that. Spectroscopy  that was another one. Parallel universes. And so this morning I thought   Oh well  I'll just do a card trick.  That one's gone as well. And today is Emmanuel's day  I think we've agreed that  already  haven't we  Emmanuel  Absolutely.  Applause  I was planning on finishing on a dance ... So  that's going to look pretty shabby now. So  what I thought I'd do is    in honor of Emmanuel    is  what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction. If I could start  this is the Enigma decoding machine. Who will start me with         Anyone  Thank you. Bruno's face  just then  he said   No  don't go through this. Don't  please don't. Don't go through this. Don't do it.  I'm worried. When I first got the invitation  they said somewhere in the thing  they said      minutes to change the world  your moment onstage.     minutes to change the world. I don't know about you  it takes me    minutes to change a plug. So  the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one. Well  of course now we know we don't have to change a plug  now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric    fantastic. You know  it inspires us.     years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that. And now it's an idea. It's great. It's fantastic. But you do meet some fantastic people  people who look at the world in a totally different way. Yesterday  David Deutsch  another one who covered most of what I was going to say. But when you think of the world in that way  it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience  don't you think  I mean  he must walk in and they will say   Would you like a macchiato  or a latte  or an Americano  or a cappuccino   And he'll say   You're offering me things that are infinitely variable.   How can your coffee be true   And they will say   Would you mind if I serve the next customer   And Elaine Morgan yesterday  wasn't she wonderful  Fantastic. Really good. Her talk about the aquatic ape  and the link  of course  the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this    we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well. And she said  you know  she's   . She's running out of time  she said. And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link. And I think   I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh.  This man has swum around the North Pole  what more evidence do you want  And there he is. That's how TED brings these connections together. I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's job application    um  sorry. I'm so sorry.  Applause  I'm so sorry. No  no.  Applause  No  no  ahh ...  Applause  The problem I have is because Gordon Brown  he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit. Uh  no.   Laughter   I'm sorry. I've only got    minutes     minutes to talk about saving the world  saving the planet  global institutions. Our work on climate change  I've only got    minutes  unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda in Great Britain  like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ...   The large coal fired power station we're building at King's North  and of course the exciting news that only today  only this week  Britain's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close. No time  unfortunately  to mention those.   British jobs for Scottish people ... No.   Laughter   Christian principles  Christian values. Thou shalt not kill  thou shalt not steal  thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.   Although to be honest  when I was at Number    that was never going to be a problem.  Alright Gordon  come on  eh. I just  can I just say a few things about  first about Cherie  because she's a wonderful lady  my wife  with a wonderful smile. That reminds me  I must post that letter.   I just think  you know  what people forget  Gordon and I  we always got on perfectly well. Alright  it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'   You know  I wrote to him  just before I left office. I said  'Can I rely on your support for the next month ' And he wrote back. He said  'No  you can't.' Which kind of surprised me  because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before.  Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in         that was to the building  the people weren't listening. But the people  when talking about the finance industry  he said   What you as the city of London have done for financial services  we  as a government  hope to do for the economy as a whole.  When you think what's happened to financial services  and you see what's happened to the economy  you think   Well  there is a man who delivers on his promises.  But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world. This is the first time that I can remember  where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan  you don't know if you're borrowing money from him  or if he's borrowing money from you. Am I right  These extraordinary things  Icelandic Internet accounts. Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account  Why would you do that  Why would    It's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria  isn't it  Asking for your bank details. And  you know  Iceland  it was never going to cut it. It didn't have that kind of collateral. What does it have  It has fish  that's all. That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said   This has left us all with a very big haddock.  A lot of what I do    I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them. And making sense of the financial crisis is very  very difficult. Luckily  somebody like George Bush was really helpful. He summed it up  really  at a dinner. He was speaking at a dinner  he said   Wall Street got drunk.   And now it's got a hangover.  And that's  you know  that's something    And that's something we can relate to. It's certainly something he can relate to. And the other one  of course  is Donald Rumsfeld  who said   There are the known knowns  the things we know we know. And then you got the known unknowns  the things we know we don't know. And then you got the unknown unknowns  those are the things we don't know we don't know.  And being English  when I first heard that I thought   What a load of cock.  And then  you're now  well  actually  that's what this is about. This whole  what Ben Bernanke has said  the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system  it's about    they don't know  they didn't know what they were doing. In       the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said  quote   As we can clearly see  no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy.  Now  there is a man on top of his job. And when the crisis was happening  the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said   Events which models predicted would happen once every        years happened every day for three days.  So  it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very  very difficult to make sense of. But we have a new hope. We have a new man. America has now elected its first openly black President. Wonderful news. Not only that  he's left handed. Have you noticed this  How many people here are left handed  You see  a lot of the people that I most admire  they're great artists  great designers  great thinkers  they're left handed. And somebody said to me last night  you know  being left handed  you have to learn to write without smudging the ink. And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday. And I thought  what a wonderful metaphor  isn't it  An American President who has to write without smudging the ink. You like that one  As opposed to you could see George Bush  well  what's the metaphor there  I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing  wouldn't it   Well  you know I'm sorry about that. I'm right handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well.  But  you know  he's gone. Now he's gone. That's eight years of American History  eight minutes of my act  just gone like that.  You know  it's the end of an error  sic . I happen to believe it was a great error. I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States. But we proved them wrong in Iraq. They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. There is now.   But I have a message for the suicide bombers  for those people who've blown themselves up.   We're going to find you.   We're going to make sure you don't do it again.  But now he's gone  and it's great to see one of the    arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history  now given way to one of the greatest  in Obama. You were there  maybe  on the night of his victory. And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago  he said   If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ...  I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long  it really would. But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration. And he and the Chief Justice  they trip over each other  they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up. And there is George Bush sitting there going   Heh heh heh heh ...   Not so easy is it  Heh heh heh.  But the interesting thing is  Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero  who said  people would listen to a speech  they said   Great speech.  And then they'd listen to Demosthenes  and they'd say   Let's march.  And we all want to believe in President Obama. It's rather like that line in the film  As Good As it Gets.  Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson  and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson   What do you see in me   And Jack Nicholson just says   You make me want to be a better man.  And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right  But at the moment  it's a Cicero thing. We like what Barack Obama says  but we don't do anything about it. So he comes over to this country  and he says   We need a big fiscal stimulus.  And everyone goes   Great   He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go   No  no  forget about that  absolutely not.  Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg. He says   We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.  And everyone goes   Great idea.  He leaves  people go   No no no  we're not going to do that.       maximum  and no rockets. No  no  not going to do it.  He goes to Prague  he says   We believe in a nuclear free world.  And it's great to have an American president who can say the word  nuclear   let's just point that out first. Do you remember that  George Bush   A nu ca ler.  Sorry  what   A nu ca ler.  Could you say  avuncular    Avunclear.  Thank you very much. But he says   We want a nuclear free world.  And that day  North Korea  that very day  North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan    and land it before ... So  where do we look for inspiration  We've still got Bill Clinton.  Travels the world.   Laughs   I believe  I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ...   Tell a lie  it was Diana Ross ...   ... who said  reach out and touch ...   ... somebody's gla    hand.   Make this world a better place  if you can. I just think that's important. I really do. And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House  because she'd have been out of our home for four years. And I  you know.   Laughter   So  when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements  let me tell you.  So  there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles   And the environment is so important  all we can do. My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda.  Or  any South Africans  we have Mandela to inspire. Mandela  the great man Mandela. He's been honored with a statue now. The previous highest honor he had in Britain was a visit from the team from Ground Force  a gardening program.  So  Nelson  how would you like a nice water feature    Ahh  listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh.   I was held in prison for nearly    years on an island in the middle of the ocean. Why would I need a bloody water feature   Very quickly  I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the  Japanese Essays on Idleness  which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth. Thank you very much indeed. The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great American lives  amazing people. And that's what it's about. We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives  but that's it. And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today. I'm going to talk about a program I started there  which  from my point of view  is the proudest thing I did. I started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore  and they're amazing people  and we want to deliver them to future generations. So  how do we do that  And so I came up with the idea of the living self portrait series. And the living self portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and I would interview. And so what I'm going to do is  not so much give you the great hits of that program  as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation  what you try to find out about them  and when people deliver and when they don't and why. Now  I had two preconditions. One was that they be American. That's just because  in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery  it's created to look at American lives. That was easy  but then I made the decision  maybe arbitrary  that they needed to be people of a certain age  which at that point  when I created this program  seemed really old. Sixties  seventies  eighties and nineties. For obvious reasons  it doesn't seem that old anymore to me. And why did I do that  Well  for one thing  we're a youth obsessed culture. And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk. But the second part of it    and the older I get  the more convinced I am that that's true. It's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out. That's the one advantage that older people have. Well  they have other  little bit of advantage  but they also have some disadvantages  but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out. So  we can then go back in our lives  if we've got an interviewer who gets that  and begin to reflect on how we got there. All of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited. So  I thought okay  now  what is it going to take to make this work  There are many kinds of interviews. We know them. There are the journalist interviews  which are the interrogation that is expected. This is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee. Then there's the celebrity interview  where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers. That's Barbara Walters and others like that  and we like that. That's Frost Nixon  where Frost seems to be as important as Nixon in that process. Fair enough. But I wanted interviews that were different. I wanted to be  as I later thought of it  empathic  which is to say  to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self revelation. By the way  this was always done in public. This was not an oral history program. This was all about     people sitting at the feet of this individual  and having me be the brush in their self portrait. Now  it turns out that I was pretty good at that. I didn't know it coming into it. And the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright  and that was six months after he'd had a stroke. And he had never appeared in public since that point. This was not a devastating stroke  but it did affect his speaking and so forth. And I thought it was worth a chance  he thought it was worth a chance  and so we got up on the stage  and we had an hour conversation about his life  and after that a woman rushed up to me  essentially did  and she said   Where did you train as a doctor   And I said   I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that.  And she said   Well  something very weird was happening. When he started a sentence  particularly in the early parts of the interview  and paused  you gave him the word  the bridge to get to the end of the sentence  and by the end of it  he was speaking complete sentences on his own.  I didn't know what was going on  but I was so part of the process of getting that out. So I thought  okay  fine  I've got empathy  or empathy  at any rate  is what's critical to this kind of interview. But then I began to think of other things. Who makes a great interview in this context  It had nothing to do with their intellect  the quality of their intellect. Some of them were very brilliant  some of them were  you know  ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals  but it was never about that. It was about their energy. It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives. I'm convinced of it. And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young. These were people through their   s. In fact  the first person I interviewed was George Abbott  who was     and Abbott was filled with the life force    I guess that's the way I think about it    filled with it. And so he filled the room  and we had an extraordinary conversation. He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent  for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two. And  in fact  he did wind up opening up    by the way  his energy is evidenced in other ways. He subsequently got married again at      so he  you know  he had a lot of the life force in him. But after the interview  I got a call  very gruff voice  from a woman. I didn't know who she was  and she said   Did you get George Abbott to talk   And I said   Yeah. Apparently I did.  And she said   I'm his old girlfriend  Maureen Stapleton  and I could never do it.  And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk. So  you know  you want energy  you want the life force  but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing. The worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest. Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest  because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them  and they sit there and they say   Aw  shucks  it was an accident.  There's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them. The worst interview I ever did  William L. Shirer. The journalist who did  The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.  This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months  and every time I'd ask him about it  he'd say   Oh  I just happened to be there. Didn't matter.  Whatever. Awful. I never would ever agree to interview a modest person. They have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you. But it comes down  in the end  to how do you get through all the barriers we have. All of us are public and private beings  and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self  there's no point in it. It's pre programmed. It's infomercial  and we all have infomercials about our lives. We know the great lines  we know the great moments  we know what we're not going to share  and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody. This wasn't    and some of you will remember Mike Wallace's old interviews    tough  aggressive and so forth. They have their place. I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say  to break out of their own cocoon of the public self  and the more public they had been  the more entrenched that person  that outer person was. And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series. It all has to do with that shell that most of us have  and particularly certain people. There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce. It'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you. She did so much. She was a playwright. She did an extraordinary play called  The Women.  She was a congresswoman when there weren't very many congresswomen. She was editor of Vanity Fair  one of the great phenomenal women of her day. And  incidentally  I call her the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right. She was sort of adored on the Right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left. And  in fact  when we did the interview    I did the living self portrait with her    there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet  just enjoying her presence. And I thought  this is going to be a piece of cake  because I always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe    or    minutes. We never talk before that because if you talk before  you don't get it on the stage. So she and I had a delightful conversation. We were on the stage and then    by the way  spectacular. It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look. She was in a great evening gown. She was     almost that day of the interview  and there she was and there I was  and I just proceeded into the questions. And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable. Anything that I would ask  she would turn around  dismiss  and I was basically up there    any of you in the moderate to full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage. And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing. And I began to wonder what was going on  and you think while you talk  and basically  I thought  I got it. When we were alone  I was her audience. Now I'm her competitor for the audience. That's the problem here  and she's fighting me for that  and so then I asked her a question    I didn't know how I was going to get out of it    I asked her a question about her days as a playwright  and again  characteristically  instead of saying   Oh yes  I was a playwright  and this is what blah blah blah   she said   Oh  playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright. Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress.  But I hadn't asked that  and then she went off on a tear  and she said   Oh  well  there was that one time that I was an actress. It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman  and I got up there   and she went on and on   And then I got on the stage.  And then she turned to me and said   And you know what those young actors did  They upstaged me.  And she said   Do you know what that is   Just withering in her contempt. And I said   I'm learning.  And she looked at me  and it was like the successful arm wrestle  and then  after that  she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like. I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce. Again  a remarkable person. I'm not politically attracted to her  but through her life force  I'm attracted to her. And the way she died    she had  toward the end  a brain tumor. That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine  and very few of us were invited to a dinner party. And she was in horrible pain. We all knew that. She stayed in her room. Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes. The usual sort of thing. Then at a certain moment  the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed  completely composed. The public self  the beauty  the intellect  and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again. She wanted the control of her final moment  and she did it amazingly. Now  there are other ways that you get somebody to open up  and this is just a brief reference. It wasn't this arm wrestle  but it was a little surprising for the person involved. I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago. And we were sitting there  and almost toward the beginning of the interview  I turned to him and I said   Steve   or  Mr. Martin  it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods. Was yours unhappy   And he looked at me  you know  as if to say   This is how you're going to start this thing  right off   And then he turned to me  not stupidly  and he said   What was your childhood like   And I said    these are all arm wrestles  but they're affectionate    and I said   My father was loving and supportive  which is why I'm not funny.  And he looked at me  and then we heard the big sad story. His father was an SOB  and  in fact  he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood  but then we were off and running. So the question is  What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed  Now  these are arm wrestle questions  but I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really  very often  are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked. And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints. One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers. Again  some of you will know him  most of you won't  Dumas Malone. He did a five volume biography of Thomas Jefferson  spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson  and by the way  at one point I asked him   Would you like to have met him   And he said   Well  of course  but actually  I know him better than anyone who ever met him  because I got to read all of his letters.  So  he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over    years. And I asked him one question. I said   Did Jefferson ever disappoint you   And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him  and he said   Well ...     I'm going to do a bad southern accent. Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally. But he said   Well   he said   I'm afraid so.  He said   You know  I've read everything  and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit.  And he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had  because he saw the letters. He said   But I understand that.  He said   I understand that.  He said   We southerners do like a smooth surface  so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation.  And he said   Now  John Adams was too honest.  And he started to talk about that  and later on he invited me to his house  and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts  and he and she had exactly the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. She was the New Englander and abrasive  and he was this courtly fellow. But really the most important question I ever asked  and most of the times when I talk about it  people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity  or cruelty  but I promise you it was the right question. This was to Agnes de Mille. Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history. She basically created the dances in  Oklahoma   transforming the American theater. An amazing woman. At the time that I proposed to her that    by the way  I would have proposed to her  she was extraordinary    but proposed to her that she come on. She said   Come to my apartment.  She lived in New York.  Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those    minutes  and then we'll decide whether we proceed.  And so I showed up in this dark  rambling New York apartment  and she called out to me  and she was in bed. I had known that she had had a stroke  and that was some    years before. And so she spent almost all of her life in bed  but    I speak of the life force    her hair was askew. She wasn't about to make up for this occasion. And she was sitting there surrounded by books  and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will  which she had by her side. She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned. She said   I keep this will by my bed  memento mori  and I change it all the time just because I want to.  And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life. I thought  this is somebody I've got to get in this series. She agreed. She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on. Half of her body was stricken  the other half not. She was  of course  done up for the occasion  but this was a woman in great physical distress. And we had a conversation  and then I asked her this unthinkable question. I said   Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful   And the audience just    you know  they're always on the side of the interviewee  and they felt that this was a kind of assault  but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life. And she began to talk about her childhood  when she was beautiful  and she literally turned    here she was  in this broken body    and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth  and then she said   And then puberty hit.  And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face  and how she could no longer count on her beauty  and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given. And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company  and in that process  she made a number of decisions. First of all  was that dance  even though it hadn't been offered to her  was her life. And secondly  she had better be  although she did dance for a while  a choreographer because then her looks didn't matter. But she was thrilled to get that out as a real  real fact in her life. It was an amazing privilege to do this series. There were other moments like that  very few moments of silence. The key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions  so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are  and I commend that to you  even if you're not doing interviews. Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family. Thank you very much. Good morning. I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering. It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy. His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System. I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind. Woman  Everywhere I went looking for work  they said no  what use do we have for a blind woman  I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair. If an ant fell into my rice  I couldn't see that either. Thulasiraj Ravilla  Becoming blind is a big part of it  but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood  their dignity  their independence  and their status in the family. So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind. And the irony is that they don't need to be. A simple  well proven surgery can restore sight to millions  and something even simpler  a pair of glasses  can make millions more see. If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses  then almost one in five Indians will require eye care  a staggering     million people. Today  we're reaching not even    percent of them. So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about    years back as a post retirement project of Dr. V. He started this with no money. He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan. And over time  we have grown into a network of five hospitals  predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry  and then we added several  what we call Vision Centers as a hub and spoke model. And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well. The last three decades  we have done about three and a half million surgeries  a vast majority of them for the poor people. Now  each year we perform about         surgeries. A typical day at Aravind  we would do about a thousand surgeries  maybe see about       patients  send out teams into the villages to examine  bring back patients  lots of telemedicine consultations  and  on top of that  do a lot of training  both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind. And then doing this day in and day out  and doing it well  requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work. And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V.  a value system  an efficient delivery process  and fostering the culture of innovation. Dr. V  I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village  and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being  you seem to be one with him. Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence. Doctor  whatever you say  I accept it. An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it. Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me  I must do my best for her. When we grow in spiritual consciousness  we identify ourselves with all that is in the world  so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing. This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient centric organization and systems that support it. But on a practical level  you also have to deliver services efficiently  and  odd as it may seem  the inspiration came from McDonald's. Dr. V  See  McDonald's' concept is simple. They feel they can train people all over the world  irrespective of different religions  cultures  all those things  to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places. Larry Brilliant  He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers  and none of it made any sense to us. He wanted to create a franchise  a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's. Dr. V  Supposing I'm able to produce eye care  techniques  methods  all in the same way  and make it available in every corner of the world. The problem of blindness is gone. TR  If you think about it  I think the eyeball is the same  as American or African  the problem is the same  the treatment is the same. And yet  why should there be so much variation in quality and in service  and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems. And  of course  the challenge was that it's a huge problem  we are talking of millions of people  very little resource to deal with it  and then lots of logistics and affordability issues. And then so  one had to constantly innovate. And one of the early innovations  which still continues  is to create ownership in the community to the problem  and then engage with them as a partner  and here is one such event. Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves  where they find a place  organize volunteers  and then we'll do our part. You know  check their vision  and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done  and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses  or check for glaucoma. And then  with all these results  the doctor makes a final diagnosis  and then prescribes a line of treatment  and if they need a pair of glasses  they are available right there at the camp site  usually under a tree. But they get glasses in the frames of their choice  and that's very important because I think glasses  in addition to helping people see  is also a fashion statement  and they're willing to pay for it. So they get it in about    minutes and those who require surgery  are counseled  and then there are buses waiting  which will transport them to the base hospital. And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support  many people like this would probably never get services  and certainly not when they most need it. They receive surgery the following day  and then they will stay for a day or two  and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from  and where their families will be waiting to take them back home. And this happens several thousand times each year. It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients  very efficient process  but we looked at  are we solving the problem  We did a study  a scientifically designed process  and then  to our dismay  we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need  and we're not adequately addressing more  bigger problems. So we had to do something different  so we set up what we call primary eye care centers  vision centers. These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on. They receive comprehensive eye exams. We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera  and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor. The effect of this has been that  within the first year  we really had a    percent penetration in the market that it served  which is over        people. And the second year went up to    percent. So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it  and in this process of using technology  make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital. And how much will they pay for this  We fixed the pricing  taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city  so they pay about    rupees  and that's good for three consultations. The other challenge was  how do you give high tech or more advanced treatment and care  We designed a van with a VSAT  which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed  and then as the patient is waiting  the report goes back to the patient  it gets printed out  the patient gets it  and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing    I mean  go see a doctor or come back after six months  and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence. So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market  because it focused on the non customer  and then by reaching the unreached  we're able to significantly grow the market. The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists  So what is in this video is a surgeon operating  and then you see on the other side  another patient is getting ready. So  as they finish the surgery  they just swing the microscope over  the tables are placed so that their distance is just right  and then we need to do this  because  by doing this kind of process  we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon. And then to support the surgeon  we require a certain workforce. And then we focused on village girls that we recruited  and then they really are the backbone of the organization. They do almost all of the skill based routine tasks. They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well. With the result we have very high productivity  very high quality at very  very low cost. So  putting all this together  what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else. This is a very busy table  but what this really is conveying is that  when it comes to quality  we have put in very good quality assurance systems. As a result  our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom  and you don't see those kind of numbers very often. So the final part of the puzzle is  how do you make all this work financially  especially when the people can't pay for it  So what we did was  we gave away a lot of it for free  and then those who pay  I mean  they paid local market rates  nothing more  and often much less. And we were helped by the market inefficiency. I think that has been a big savior  even now. And  of course  one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus. The result has been  over the years  the expenditure has increased with volumes. The revenues increase at a higher level  giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free. I think in absolute terms  last year we earned about    odd million dollars  spent about    million  with over a    percent EBITA. But this really requires going beyond what we do  or what we have done  if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness. And what we did was a couple of very counter intuitive things. We created competition for ourselves  and then we made eye care affordable by making low cost consumables. We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India  many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well. The impact of this has been that these hospitals  in the second year after our consultation  are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well. The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology  There was a time when we failed to negotiate the  intra ocular lens  prices to be at affordable levels  so we set up a manufacturing unit. And then  over time  we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out. Today  we believe we have about seven percent of the global market  and they're used in about     odd countries. To conclude  I mean  what we do  does it have a broader relevance  or is it just India or developing countries  So to address this  we studied UK versus Aravind. What it shows is that we do roughly about    percent of the volume of what the UK does  near a half million surgeries as a whole country. And we do about        . And then we train about    ophthalmologists against the    trained by them  comparable quality  both in training and in patient care. So we're really comparing apples to apples. We looked at cost. So  I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening. I think there is more to it. I mean  I think one has to look at other aspects as well. Maybe there is    the solution to the cost could be in productivity  maybe in efficiency  in the clinical process  or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables  or regulations  their defensive practice. So  I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S.  and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again. Another insight  which  again  I want to leave with you  in conditions where the problem is very large  which cuts across all economic strata  where we have a good solution  I think the process I described  you know  productivity  quality  patient centered care  can give an answer  and there are many which fit this paradigm. You take dentistry  hearing aid  maternity and so on. There are many where this paradigm can now play  but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side. Now  how do you create compassion  Now  how do you make people own the problem  want to do something about it  There are a bit harder issues. And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these. So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you. Dr. V  When you grow in spiritual consciousness  we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing. TR  Thank you very much. Hello  everyone. Because this is my first time at TED  I've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit. Yes. That's right. This is Barbie. She's    years old. And she's looking as young as ever. But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face. This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie. Now  according to proponents of the clash of civilizations  Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres. They have different interests. They have divergent values. And should they ever come in contact ... well  I've got to tell you  it's just not going to be pretty. My experience  however  in the Islamic world is very different. Where I work  in the Arab region  people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western  nor are they traditionally Islamic. I want to show you two examples. The first is  Shbab. It means  for youth  and it's a new Arab TV channel. The USA.   I am not afraid to stand alone     I am not afraid to stand alone  if Allah is by my side     I am not afraid to stand alone     Everything will be all right     I am not afraid to stand alone   The Arab world.   She was preserved by modesty of the religion     She was adorned by the light of the Quran   Shereen El Feki   Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV. Its creator  who is an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Ha ba  wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives. He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.  Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels. And they look something like this. That  by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star and pan Arab pin up girl. In the world of  Shbab  it's not about bump and grind. But it's not about fire and brimstone either. Its videos are intended to show a kinder  gentler face of Islam  for young people to deal with life's challenges. Now  my second example is for a slightly younger crowd. And it's called  The   .  Now  these are the world's first Islamic superheroes. They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa. And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance  all in a child friendly format.  The   .  The characters are meant to embody the    attributes of Allah  justice  wisdom  mercy  among others. So  for example  there is the character of Noora. She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone. Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions. Now   The     is not just a comic book. It's now a theme park. There is an animated series in the works. And by this time next year  the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with  The     to beat injustice wherever they find it.  The     and  Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross cultural hybridization. We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations. Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash. I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations  in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined. Now  while  Shbab and  The     may look new and shiny  there is actually a very long tradition of this. Throughout its history  Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern. After all  it's the Quran which encourages us to do this   We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another.  And to my mind  those are pretty wise words  no matter what your creed. Thank you. I'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life.    years ago I received a phone call from a friend. At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails. He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades. Now  as many of you may remember  the Red Brigades was a terrorist  Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the     s until the mid     s. As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody  not even with their lawyers. They sat in silence through their trails  waving occasionally at family and friends. In      they declared the end of the armed struggle. And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk  and tell their story. And I was one of those people. When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me  he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name. In particular  one person had put it forward. She was my childhood friend. She had joined the Red Brigades and became a leader of the organization. Naturally  I didn't know that until the day she was arrested. In fact  I read it in the newspaper. At the time of the phone call I just had a baby  I successfully completed a management buyout to the company I was working with  and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high security prisons. But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist  and why she'd never tried to recruit me. So  this is exactly what I did. Now  I found the answer very quickly. I actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist. The center committee of the Red Brigades had judged me too single minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist. My friend  on the other hand  she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders. She also embraced violence. Because she believed that the only way to unblock what  at the time  was known as a blocked democracy  Italy  a country run by the same party for    years was the arms struggle. At the same time  while I was interviewing the Red Brigades  I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology  but actually was ruled by economics. They were constantly short of cash. They were constantly searching for cash. Now  contrary to what many people believe  terrorism is actually a very expensive business. I'll give you an idea. In the     s  the turnover of the Red Brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars. This is roughly between     and     million  today. Now  you know  if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money. But this also explains why  when I was interviewing the Red Brigades  and then  later on  other arms organizations  including members of al Zarqawi group in the Middle East  everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology  or politics. Because they had no idea. The political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership  which  generally  is never more than five to seven people. All the others do  day in and day out  is search for money. Once  for example  I was interviewing this part timer from the Red Brigades. It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing. He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat. And he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the Red Brigades and he went sailing  every summer  back and forth from Lebanon  where he would pick up Soviet weapons from the PLO  and then carry them all the way to Sardinia where the other arms organization from Europe would go and take their share of the arms. For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee  which went to fund their organization. So  because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms  all of the sudden I thought  maybe there is something here. Maybe there is a link  a commercial link  between one organization and another one. But it was only when I interviewed Mario Moretti  the head of the Red Brigades  the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro  Italian former prime minister  that I finally realized that terrorism is actually business. I was having lunch with him in a high security prison in Italy. And as we were eating  I had the distinct feeling that I was back in the city of London  having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist. This guy thought in the same way I did. So  I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism. Naturally  nobody wanted to fund my research. In fact  I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy. You know  that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money  thinking about the economics of terrorism. So  in the end  I took a decision that  in retrospect  did change my life. I sold my company  and funded the research myself. And what I discovered is this parallel reality  another international economic system  which runs parallel to our own  which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II. And what is even more shocking is that this system has followed  step by step  the evolution of our own system  of our Western capitalism. And there are three main stages. The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism. The second one is the privatization of terrorism. And the third  of course  is the globalization of terrorism. So  state sponsor of terrorism  feature of the Cold War. This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy  along the periphery of the sphere of influence  fully funding arms organizations. A mix of legal and illegal activities is used. So  the link between crime and terror is established very early on. And here is the best example  the Contras in Nicaragua  created by the CIA  legally funded by the U.S. Congress  illegally funded by the Reagan administration via covert operation  for example  the Iran Contra Affair. Then comes the late     s  early '  s  and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism. So  they gain independence from the sponsor  and start funding themselves. Now  again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities. So  Arafat used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from Bek a Valley  which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria. And the IRA  which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland  did exactly the same thing. So  every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing  actually  was funding the IRA. But the great change came  of course  with globalization and deregulation. This is when arms organization were able to link up  also financially  with each other. But above all  they started to do serious business with the world of crime. And together they money laundered their dirty business through the same channel. This is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization Al Qaeda. This is an organization that can raise money across border. But also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country. Now  deregulation also brought back rogue economics. So what is rogue economics  Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history. It comes back at times of great transformation  globalization being one of those transformations. It is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy  and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us. It has happened before in history. It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire. It has happened with Industrial Revolution. And it actually happened again  with the fall of the Berlin wall. Now  I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime  terror  and illegal economy  before     . And it is a staggering  .  trillion dollars. It is trillions  it's not billions. This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom  soon will be more  considering where this country is going. Now  until       the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States. The entry point  of course  of most of this money were the off shore facilities. So  this was a vital injection of cash into the U.S. economy. Now  when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply  the U.S. money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars  which  of course  reflects the growth of the economy. So  when I went to look at those figures  I noted that since the late     s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the United States  never to come back. These were money taken out in suitcases or in containers  in cash of course. These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers. These were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror  illegal and criminal economy. So  you see  what is the relationship  The United States actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world. What does it mean  That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have. It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world. This privilege is called seigniorage. No other country can do that. All the other countries  for example the United Kingdom  can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders. So  here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime  terror  and illegal economy  and our economy. The U.S. in the     s was borrowing against the growth of the terror  illegal and criminal economy. This is how close we are with this world. Now  this situation changed  of course  after       because George Bush launched the War on Terror. Part of the War on Terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act. Now  many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism. But there is a section of the Patriot Act which refers specifically to finance. And it is  in fact  an anti money laundering legislation. What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U.S. bank  and U.S. registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off shore facilities. It closed that door between the money laundering in dollars  and the U.S. economy. It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world. Now  you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking. All the bankers said to their clients   Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else.  Now  the Euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business  and  of course  for investment. And this is what people did. Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority to check their relationship  to monitor their relationship with their clientele. The same thing happened  of course  in the world of crime and terror. People simply moved their money laundering activities away from the United States into Europe. Why did this happen  This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation. It was introduced only in the United States. And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars. In Europe  a similar legislation was not introduced. So  within six months Europe became the epicenter of the money laundering activities of the world. So  this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror  and our own life. So  why did I tell you this story  I told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers  including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family. You got to question everything that is told to you  including what I just told you today. This is the only way for you to step into the dark side  and have a look at it. And believe me  it's going to be scary. It's going to be frightful  but it's going to enlighten you. And  above all  it's not going to be boring. My name is Ryan Lobo  and I've been involved in the documentary filmmaking business all over the world for the last    years. During the process of making these films I found myself taking photographs  often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen. I found this photography of mine almost compulsive. And at the end of a shoot  I would sometimes feel that I had photographs that told a better story than a sometimes sensational documentary. I felt  when I had my photographs  that I was holding on to something true  regardless of agendas or politics. In       I traveled to three war zones. I traveled to Iraq  Afghanistan and Liberia. And over there I experienced other people's suffering  up close and personal  immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories  and at times I experienced great fear for my own life. As always  I would return to Bangalore  and often to animated discussions at friend's homes  where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings  where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid their    year old maid. I would feel very isolated during these discussions. But at the same time  I questioned myself and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling. And I decided that I had compromised  just like my friends in those discussions  where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for  rather than taking responsibility for. I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made  but let's just say it involved alcohol  cigarettes  other substances and a woman. I basically decided that it was I  not the camera or the network  or anything that lay outside myself  that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning. In my life  when I tried to achieve things like success or recognition  they eluded me. Paradoxically  when I let go of these objectives  and worked from a place of compassion and purpose  looking for excellence  rather than the results of it  everything arrived on its own  including fulfillment. Photography transcended culture  including my own. And it is  for me  a language which expressed the intangible  and gives voice to people and stories without. I invite you into three recent stories of mine  which are about this way of looking  if you will  which I believe exemplify the tenets of what I like to call compassion in storytelling. In      I went to Liberia  where a group of my friends and I did an independent  self funded film  still in progress  on a very legendary and brutal war lord named General Butt Naked. His real name is Joshua  and he's pictured here in a cell where he once used to torture and murder people  including children. Joshua claims to have personally killed more than        people during Liberia's civil war. He got his name from fighting stark naked. And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on Earth today. This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother. Joshua commanded his child soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes  and enforced his command with great brutality. Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin  and they are destitute  like these young men in the image. How do you live with yourself if you know you've committed horrific crimes  Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist. And he's on a mission. We accompanied Joshua  as he walked the Earth  visiting villages where he had once killed and raped. He seeked forgiveness  and he claims to endeavor to improve the lives of his child soldiers. During this expedition I expected him to be killed outright  and us as well. But what I saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which I never thought possible. In the midst of incredible poverty and loss  people who had nothing absolved a man who had taken everything from them. He begs for forgiveness  and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered. Senegalese  the young man seated on the wheelchair here  was once a child soldier  under the General's command  until he disobeyed orders  and the General shot off both his legs. He forgives the General in this image. He risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he'd murdered. In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him. And Joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him. This image  to me  is almost like from a Shakespearean play  with a man  surrounded by various influences  desperate to hold on to something true within himself  in a context of great suffering that he has created himself. I was intensely moved during all this. But the question is  does forgiveness and redemption replace justice  Joshua  in his own words  says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes  and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia  to an audience that often includes his victims. A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of separation of church and state. The second story I'm going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace keeping skills. Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars  which has left more than         people dead  thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale. Liberia is now home to an all woman United Nations contingent of Indian peacekeepers. These women  many from small towns in India  help keep the peace  far away from home and family. They use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response. The commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men. And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non aggressively. This man was very drunk  and he was very interested in my camera  until he noticed the women  who handled him with smiles  and AK   s at the ready  of course. This contingent seems to be quite lucky  and it has not sustained any casualties  even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia. And yes  all of those people killed were male. Many of the women are married with children  and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children. I accompanied these women on their patrols  and watched as they walked past men  many who passed very lewd comments incessantly. And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response  she said   Don't worry  same thing back home. We know how to deal with these fellows   and ignored them. In a country ravaged by violence against women  Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women to join the police force. Sometimes  when the war is over and all the film crews have left  the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar. I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story. And one editor told me that she wasn't interested in doing what she called  manual labor stories.  In      and      I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service  the DFS  which  during the summer  is probably the world's most active fire department. They answer more than       calls in just two months. And all this against incredible logistical odds  like heat and traffic jams. Something amazing happened during this shoot. Due to a traffic jam  we were late in getting to a slum  a large slum  which had caught fire. As we neared  angry crowds attacked our trucks and stoned them  by hundreds of people all over the place. These men were terrified  as the mob attacked our vehicle. But nonetheless  despite the hostility  firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire. Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds  and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury. Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes. Now  hundreds of homes were destroyed. But the question that lingered in my mind was  what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes  Where does such rage come from  And how are we responsible for this     percent of the    million people who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums  which are chronically overcrowded. They lack even the most basic amenities. And this is something that is common to all our big cities. Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire  thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals were blazing away and exploding all around us. The heat was so intense  that hoses were used to cool down firefighters fighting extremely close to the fire  and with no protective clothing. In India we often love to complain about our government bodies. But over here  the heads of the DFS  Mr. R.C. Sharman  Mr. A.K. Sharman  led the firefight with their men. Something wonderful in a country where manual labor is often looked down upon. Over the years  my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested. And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy  and my own faith in humanity. However  a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel. And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them. Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired to do better because they were so pleased to get thank yous rather than brick bats. It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS  at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions  read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire. Sometimes  focusing on what's heroic  beautiful and dignified  regardless of the context  can help magnify these intangibles three ways  in the protagonist of the story  in the audience  and also in the storyteller. And that's the power of storytelling. Focus on what's dignified  courageous and beautiful  and it grows. Thank you. So  now  there are a lot of web  .  consultants who make a lot of money. In fact  they make their livings on this kind of stuff. I'm going to try and save you all the time and all the money and go through it in the next three minutes  so bear with me. Started a website back in       with a few friends of mine  called Reddit.com. That's what you'd call a social news website. Basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web. You find some interesting content  say a TEDTalk  submit it to Reddit  and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it  vote it down if they don't. And that creates the front page. It's always rising  falling  always changing. About a half million people visit every day. But this isn't about Reddit. This is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web. Because in the last four years we've seen all kinds of memes  all kinds of trends get born right on our front page. But this isn't even about Reddit itself. It's actually about humpback whales. Well  okay  technically it's actually about Greenpeace  which is an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government on their whaling campaign. These humpback whales were getting killed. They wanted to put an end to it. And one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales. But to really kind of personify the movement  they wanted to name it. So  in true web fashion they put together a poll where they had a bunch of very erudite  very thoughtful  cultured names. I believe this is a Farsi word for  immortal.  I think this means  divine power of the ocean  in a Polynesian language. And then there was this  Mister Splashy Pants. And this  this was special. Mister Pants  or Splashy  to his friends  was very popular on the Internet. In fact  someone on Reddit thought   Oh  what a great thing  we should all vote this up.  And  you know  Redditors responded and all agreed. So  the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves. We changed our logo  for the day  from the alien to a Splashy  to sort of help the cause. And it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying   Yes  We love Splashy Pants.  So  it went from about five percent  which was when this meme started  to    percent at the end of voting. Which is pretty impressive right  We won  Mister Splashy Pants was chosen. Hmm  just kidding. Okay. So  Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it  because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win. So they said   No  no  just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting.  Well  that got us a little angry. So  we changed it to Fightin' Splashy. And the Reddit community  really  and the rest of the internet  rather  really got behind this. Facebook groups were getting created. Facebook applications were getting created. The idea was   Vote your conscience   vote for Mister Splashy Pants. And people were putting up signs in the real world    And this was the final vote. When all was cleared ...    percent of the votes  and to give you an idea of the landslide  the next highest name pulled in three. Okay  So  there was a clear lesson here. And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants. Which is obvious. It's a great name. Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say   Mister Splashy Pants.  And I think that's what helped drive this. But what was cool was that the repercussions now for Greenpeace was  they created an entire marketing campaign around it. They sell Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins. They even created an e card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy. But what was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission. The Japanese government called off their whaling expedition. Mission accomplished. Greenpeace was thrilled. The whales were happy. That's a quote. And actually  Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate  but they weren't whale lovers. A few of them certainly were. But we're talking about a lot of people who were just really interested and really caught up in this great meme  and in fact someone from Greenpeace came back on the site and thanked Reddit for its participation. But this wasn't really out of altruism. This was just out of interest in doing something cool. And this is kind of how the Internet works. This is that great big secret. Because the Internet provides this level playing field. Your link is just as good as your link  which is just as good as my link. As long as we have a browser  anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have. That is  as long as you can keep net neutrality in place. The other important thing is that it costs nothing to get that content online now. There are so many great publishing tools that are available  it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something. And the cost of iteration is so cheap that you might as well give it a go. And if you do  be genuine about it. Be honest. Be up front. And one of the great lessons that Greenpeace actually learned was that it's okay to lose control. It's okay to take yourself a little less seriously  given that  even though it's a very serious cause  you could ultimately achieve your final goal. And that's the final message that I want to share with all of you    that you can do well online. But no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down. If you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control. Thank you. Actually  I come from Britain  but I've been living in Maldives for    years now. So  that's home really. The Maldives  as I'm sure you're aware  are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of India here. Capital  Mal   where I live. Actually  sitting here today in Mysore  we're closer to Mal  than we are to Delhi  for example. If you're in IT  India  obviously  is the place to be at the moment. But if you're a marine biologist  Maldives is not such a bad place to be. And it has been my home these years. For those of you who've been there  fantastic coral reefs  fantastic diving  fantastic snorkeling. I spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life. I study fish  also the bigger things  whales and dolphins. This is a blue whale. We have blue whales in the waters around here  off Maldives  around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala. And  in fact  we're very lucky in this region. One of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region. In Sri Lanka  if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka  during the northeast monsoon season  you can see blue whales very  very easily. It's probably the best place in the world to see them. Now  when I talk about the northeast monsoon season  I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean  but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure. I need to explain a little bit about monsoons. Now  monsoon  the root of the word  monsoon  comes from the word  season.  So  it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia. And in the summer India heats up  gets very hot. Hot air rises  and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it. And the way it works is  it comes from the southwest. It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India. So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon. Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean. That's what brings the monsoon rain. And then in the winter things cool down. High pressure builds over India. And the whole system goes into reverse. So  the wind is now coming from the northeast out of India  across the Indian Ocean  this way towards Africa. Keep that in mind. Now  I'm a marine biologist  but I'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist  I suppose. I'm interested in all sorts of things  almost everything that moves  including dragonflies. And I'm actually going to talk  this afternoon  about dragonflies. This is a very beautiful species  it's called the Oriental Scarlet. And one thing you need to know about dragonflies  one important thing  is that they lay their eggs in fresh water. They need fresh water to breed. They lay the eggs into fresh water. Little larvae hatch out in fresh water. They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae. So  they're very important. They control mosquito larvae  among other things. And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out of the water  burst out  as the adult which we see. And typically  there is a lot of variation  but if you have a dragonfly with  say  a one year life cycle  which is quite typical  the larva  living in the fresh water  lives for    or    months. And then the adult  which comes after  lives for one or two months. So it's essentially a freshwater animal. It really does need fresh water. Now  the particular species of dragonfly I want to talk about is this one  because most dragonflies  like the one we've just seen  when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life  it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far. A few kilometers  maybe  is quite typical. They are very good fliers  but they don't go too far. But this guy is an exception. And this is called the Globe Skimmer  or Wandering Glider. And  as the name might suggest  it is found pretty much around the world. It lives throughout the tropics  the Americas  Africa  Asia  Australia  into the Pacific. And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it. But it really hasn't been studied very much. It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly. If you're going to study dragonflies  you want to study those really bright beautiful ones  like that red one. Or the really rare ones  the endemic endangered ones. This is  it seems a bit dull you know. It's sort of dull colored. And it's fairly common. And it occurs everywhere    you know  why bother  But if you take that attitude  you're actually missing something rather special. Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell. And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the Maldives. When I first went to the Maldives  dead keen on diving  spent as much of my time as I could in and under the water. Didn't notice any dragonflies  maybe they were there  maybe they weren't. Didn't notice them. But after some time  after some months  one day as I was going out and about  suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies  hundreds of dragonflies. Something like this  these are all this species Globe Skimmer. I didn't know at the time  but I know now  they're Globe Skimmers  hundreds of them. And they were there for some time. And then they were gone. And I didn't think anything more of it until the following year  when it happened again  and then the year after that  and then the year after that. And I was a bit slow  I didn't really take too much notice. But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues  and yes they come every year. And I asked people about them and yes  they knew  but they didn't know anything  where they came from  or anything. And again I didn't think too much of it. But slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening. Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed. And the Maldives  and I'm sure some of you have been there    so here is home. So  Maldives  beautiful place. It's built entirely of coral reefs. And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks. Average height  about that much above sea level. So  global warming  sea level rise  it's a real serious issue. But I'm not going to talk about that. Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains  the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So  it's gone. So  it stays under the soil. The trees can put their roots into it. Humans can dig holes and make a well. But dragonflies    a bit tricky. There is no surface fresh water. There are no ponds  streams  rivers  lakes  nothing like that. So  why is it that every year millions of dragonflies  millions  millions of dragonflies turn up  I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here  because I want to ask  and there is a lot of people who  from India of course  people who grew up spending your childhood here. Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here  let me have a show of hands  who of you    not yet  not yet  You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on. Wait for the go. I'll say go. Those of you who grew up in India  do you remember in your childhood  dragonflies  swarms of dragonflies  Maybe at school  maybe tying little bits of string onto them  Maybe pulling bits off  I'm not asking about that. You've only got to say  do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies. Any hands  Any hands  Yes. Thank you. Thank you. It's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia  including the Maldives. And I got a bit curious about it. In the Maldives    now  in India there is plenty of water  so  dragonflies  yeah  of course. Why not  But in Maldives  no fresh water. So  what on Earth is going on  And the first thing I did was started recording when they turned up in the Maldives. And there is the answer    st of October. Not every year  that's the average date. So  I've been writing it down for    years now. You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place. But in October  remember  we're still in southwest monsoon  Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon. But wind is  invariably  every time  is from the west. It's going towards India  not from India. So  are these things  how are these things getting here  Are they coming from India against the wind  Seemed a bit unlikely. So  next thing I did is I got on the phone. Maldives is a long archipelago. It stretches about     miles  of course it's India here. I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues. When do you see the dragonflies appear  And pretty soon  a picture started emerging. In Bangalore  a colleague there sent me information for three years  average    th of September  so late September. Down in Trivandrum  a bit later. Far north of Maldives  a bit later. Then Mal   then further south. And then the southernmost Maldives. It's pretty obvious  they're coming from India. But they are coming     miles across the ocean  against the wind. How on Earth are they doing that  I didn't know. The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies. I wanted to know about their seasonality  what time of year  this is when they first arrive  but how long are they around for  Does that give any clues  So  I started a very rigorous scientific process. I had a rigorous scientific transect. I got on my bicycle  and I cycled around the island of Mal . It's about five kilometers around  counting the dragonflies as I go  trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees. And they're here for a very short time  October  November  December. That's it. And then they tail off  there's a few  but that's it. October  November  December. That is not the northeast monsoon season. That's not the southwest season. That's the inter monsoon  the time when the monsoon changes. Now  what I said was  you get the southwest monsoon going one way  and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way. And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass going up and down  up and down. It doesn't work like that. What happens  actually  is there is two air masses. And there is a front between them  and the front moves. So  if you've got India here  when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon. Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon. And that front in the middle is not vertical  it's at an angle. So  as it comes over towards Mal  I'm standing in Mal  underneath the front. I can be in the southwest monsoon. But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon. So  the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon  but at an altitude at       to       meters up in the air. Incredible. These little insects  it's the same ones we see out here  in India   two inches long  five centimeters long  flying in their millions      miles across the ocean  at       meters up. Quite incredible. So  I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow  I've tracked this one  I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit  and that's okay  I know how they come here  but why do they come here  What are millions of dragonflies doing  flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom  It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives. What on Earth are they doing  Well  to cut a long story short  they're actually flying right across the ocean. They're making it all the way across to East Africa. I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean. I know because we have reports from Seychelles  which fit in as well  down here. And I know because when you look at the rainfall  these particular insects  these Globe Skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools. Okay  they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are  the monsoon rains. The larvae have to develop very quickly. They only take six weeks. Instead of    months  they're six weeks. They're up  and they're off. Now  here we have  in case you can't read at the back  the top is rainfall for India. And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain. By September  October  it's drying out. Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain. They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain. And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through Karnataka  into Kerala. And then they run out of land. But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species  it can fly for thousands of kilometers. And it just keeps going. And the wind  the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa  where it's raining. And they are breeding in the rains of Africa. Now  this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that. What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here. And the dragonflies you can see today outside here  on the campus  are the young of this generation. They hatched out in India. They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed. But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop  perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa. The wind will swoosh them out across here. If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look  nothing there  they'll carry on. Here  here  Kenya  East Africa  they've actually just come out of a long drought. Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke and it's raining there now. And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts. The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there. When those guys  they'll lay their eggs now. They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there  it's down here. They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is. The rain occurs  these are summer rains. This is a summer monsoon. The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa. The sun is overhead  maximum heating  maximum evaporation  maximum clouds  maximum rainfall  maximum opportunities for reproduction. Not only that  because you have this convection  you have this rising of the air where it's hot  air is drawn in. There's a convergence. So  wherever the rain is falling  the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising. So  the little fellow that hatches out here  he gets up into the air  he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling. Lay their eggs  next generation  they come up  automatically carried to where the rain is falling. It's now back there. They come out  it's time to come back. So  in four generations  one  two  three  four and then back. A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean. This is a circuit of about        kilometers.        kilometers  four generations  mind you  for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible. Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly. Which  up until now has had the longest known insect migration. It's only half the length of this one. And this crossing here  of the ocean  is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect. A quite incredible feat. And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Mal   in Maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on. But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing. There is more to the story. I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar with this fellow. This is a rather special bird. It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red footed falcon  obviously. But it's also called the Amur Falcon. And it's called the Amur Falcon because it breeds in Amurland. Which is an area along the Amur River  which is up here. It's the border  much of it is the border between China and Russia  up here in the far east. So  Siberia  Manchuria. And that's where it breeds. And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer. But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter. It's  well  you can imagine. So  as any sensible bird would do  he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south. But then the being sensible stopped. So  now they don't stop here  or even down here. No  they turn across here. They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India. They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa. And then they strike out across the ocean  down to Kenya. And down here  and they winter down here  in southern Africa . Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration. And they are not the only one that makes the crossing. They have the most incredible journey  but several make the crossing from India to Africa. Includes this one  the hobby. This fellow is a very nice bird  this is the Pied cuckoo. Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this. It comes with the monsoons. This time of year they cross back to Africa. And this guy  the roller  a rather beautiful bird. It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest  so it's known as the Kashmir Roller. And these birds  what I've done is I've complied all the records  all the available records of these birds  put them together  and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies. They make use of exactly the same winds. They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude. It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy  unfortunately  one of these met an unfortunate end. He was flying off the coast of Goa     years ago      . October      . An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa  bang  In the middle of the night. Fortunately  a two engine jet got back to base  and they pulled the remains of one of these  Eurasian Rollers  out. Flying at night over the Indian Ocean       meters. Same height as the dragonflies go. So  they are using the same winds. And the other thing  the other important factor for all these birds  all medium sized fellows  and this includes the next slide as well  which is a bee eater. Bee eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek. It's a Blue cheeked Bee eater. And every one of these birds that makes the crossing from India to East Africa eats insects  large insects  the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much. Metaphor lives a secret life all around us. We utter about six metaphors a minute. Metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others  how we communicate  learn  discover and invent. But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words. Now  to assist me in explaining this  I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers  the reigning king of the metaphorians  a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor. I am  of course  referring to none other than Elvis Presley. Now   All Shook Up  is a great love song. It's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract    ideas  emotions  feelings  concepts  thoughts    we inevitably resort to metaphor. In  All Shook Up   a touch is not a touch  but a chill. Lips are not lips  but volcanoes. She is not she  but a buttercup. And love is not love  but being all shook up. In this  Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else. This is the mathematics of metaphor. And fortunately it's very simple. X equals Y. This formula works wherever metaphor is present. Elvis uses it  but so does Shakespeare in this famous line from  Romeo and Juliet   Juliet is the sun. Now  here  Shakespeare gives the thing  Juliet  a name that belongs to something else  the sun. But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else  we give it a whole network of analogies too. We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source  in this case the sun  with what we know about its target  Juliet. And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like. So  how do we make and understand metaphors  This might look familiar. The first step is pattern recognition. Look at this image. What do you see  Three wayward Pac Men  and three pointy brackets are actually present. What we see  however  are two overlapping triangles. Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns  it is the creation of patterns. Second step  conceptual synesthesia. Now  synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well  such as colored hearing. People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters. We all have synesthetic abilities. This is the Bouba Kiki test. What you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called Bouba  and which is called Kiki. If you are like    percent of other people  you will identify the round  amoeboid shape as Bouba  and the sharp  spiky one as Kiki. Can we do a quick show of hands  Does that correspond  Okay  I think   .  would about cover it. Why do we do that  Because we instinctively find  or create  a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba  and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki. And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic. Silence is sweet. Neckties are loud. Sexually attractive people are hot. Sexually unattractive people leave us cold. Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia  in which we understand one concept in the context of another. Third step is cognitive dissonance. This is the Stroop test. What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed. You can take the test now. If you're like most people  you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink. The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer. Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well. The participants had to identify  as quickly as possible  the literally false sentences. They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences. Why  Because we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either. One of the sentences was   Some jobs are jails.  Now  unless you're a prison guard  the sentence  Some jobs are jails  is literally false. Sadly  it's metaphorically true. And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false. Metaphor matters because it's around us every day  all the time. Metaphor matters because it creates expectations. Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news. Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing  as in   The NASDAQ climbed higher.  Object metaphors describe price movements as non living things  as in   The Dow fell like a brick.  Researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries  and then predict the next day's price trend. Those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue. And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal. If  for example  house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing  higher and higher  people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable. They may feel confident  say  in taking out mortgages they really can't afford. That's a hypothetical example of course. But this is how metaphor misleads. Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies. A group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help. And they had to make a decision. What should they do  Intervene  appeal to the U.N.  or do nothing  They were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis. Each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy  World War II  Vietnam  and the third was historically neutral. Those exposed to the World War II scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others. Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words  we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor. Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery. Whenever we solve a problem  or make a discovery  we compare what we know with what we don't know. And the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former. Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play. He famously used thought experiments  which are essentially elaborate analogies  to come up with some of his greatest discoveries. By bringing together what we know and what we don't know through analogy  metaphorical thinking strikes the spark that ignites discovery. Now metaphor is ubiquitous  yet it's hidden. But you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it. Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as  fossil poetry.  But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor. And these fossils still breathe. Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy   Cogito ergo sum.  That's routinely translated as   I think  therefore I am.  But there is a better translation. The Latin word  cogito  is derived from the prefix  co   meaning  together   and the verb  agitare   meaning  to shake.  So  the original meaning of  cogito  is to shake together. And the proper translation of  cogito ergo sum  is  I shake things up  therefore I am.  Metaphor shakes things up  giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process. The mind is a plastic snow dome  the most beautiful  most interesting  and most itself  when  as Elvis put it  it's all shook up. And metaphor keeps the mind shaking  rattling and rolling  long after Elvis has left the building. Thank you very much. The anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year  becoming a full time practicing lawyer. My experiences over the last    months  as a lawyer  has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea  which I believe is indeed worth spreading. So  I share it with all of you here today  though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I'm still writing up the business plan. Of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed increases. I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since     . I've explored  experienced  and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart's content. I built  along with my two brothers  the leading real estate company in my home state  Kerala  and then worked professionally with two of India's biggest businessmen  but in their startup enterprises. In       when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so called social sector issues  I definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for profit solutions to addressing pressing public issues. When life brought about a series of death and near death experiences within my close circle  which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India  similar to     in USA. To address this  I  along with four friends  founded Ambulance Access for All  to promote life support ambulance services in India. For those from the developing world  there is nothing  absolutely nothing new in this idea. But as we envisioned it  we had three key goals  Providing world class life support ambulance service which is fully self sustainable from its own revenue streams  and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency  irrespective of the capability to pay. The service which grew out of this  Dial      for Ambulance  with one ambulance in       now has a hundred plus ambulances in three states  and has transported over         patients and victims since inception. The service is     Applause  fully self sustainable from its own revenues  without accessing any public funds  and the cross subsidy model actually works  where the rich pays higher  poor pays lower  and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge. The service responded effectively and efficiently  during the unfortunate       Mumbai terror attacks. And as you can see from the visuals  the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike. We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported     victims  saving life. In tribute and remembrance of       attacks over the last one year  we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO  Aman Foundation  to set up a self sustainable life support ambulance service in Karachi  facilitated by Acumen Fund. It's a small message from us  in our own small way to the enemies of humanity  of Islam  of South Asia  of India  and of Pakistan  that humanity will continue to bloom  irrespective of such dastardly attacks. Since then I've also co founded two other social enterprises. One is Education Access for All  setting up schools in small town India. And the other is Moksha Yug Access  which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self help group based microfinance. I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right. Because diligent investors and venture funds have committed over  .  million dollars in funding. With the significance being these funds have come in as a QT capital  not as grant or as philanthropy. Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that I'm exploring. Corruption  bribes  and lack of transparency. You may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks. Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side  with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless common man. And the demand side being mostly politicians  bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them. According to World Bank estimate  one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year  worsening the condition of the already worse off. Yet  if you analyze the common man  he or she does not wake up every day and say   Hmm  let me see who I can pay a bribe to today.  or   Let me see who I can corrupt today.  Often it is the constraining or the back to the wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe. In the modern day world  where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough  the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life. Now  let me ask you another question. Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day to day life to get something done. What do you do  Of course you can call the police. But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption  Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe. But you also don't have the time  resources  expertise or wherewithal to fight this. Unfortunately  many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces. Yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in  pay a fee  and fight the demand for a bribe. Like a bribe buster service  or       Fight Bribes  or www.stopbribes.org or www.preventcorruption.org. Such a service simply do not exist. One image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother     plus years  being harassed by the bureaucrats in the town planning office. All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house  from ground level  making it easier for her to enter and exit her house. Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe. Even though it pricked my conscience then  I could not  or rather I did not tend to her or assist her  because I was busy building my real estate company. I don't want to be haunted by such images any more. A group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement. And in all    cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the Right to Information Act  video  audio  or peer pressure  we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe. And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower than the bribe demanded. I believe that these tools that worked in these    pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment  and made available on web  call center and franchise physical offices  for a fee  to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe. The target market is as tempting as it can get. It can be worth up to one trillion dollars  being paid in bribes every year  or equal to India's GDP. And it is an absolutely virgin market. I propose to explore this idea further  to examine the potential of creating a for profit  fee based BPO kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption. I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy. It never has been and it never will be. In my last    months as a lawyer  battling small  and large scale corruption  including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster. Through his charities I have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass  impersonation and intimidation. The battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves  our families  our friends  and even our kids. Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place. What gives us the courage  As my close friend replied  when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue chip jobs  I quote   Of course we cannot fail in this  at least in our own minds. For we are insane people  trying to do an impossible task. And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Shaffi  that is a really exciting business idea. Shaffi Mather  I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated. CA  What's on your mind  I mean  give us a sense of the numbers here    a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean  what's in your head  SM  So let me ... Let me give you an example. Somebody who had applied for the passport. The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around       rupees in bribes. And he did not want to pay. So we actually used the Right to Information Act  which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States  and pushed back the officers in this particular case. And in all these    cases  when we kept pushing them back  there was three kinds of reaction. A set of people actually say   Oh  let me just grant it to them  and run away from it.  Some people actually come back and say   Oh  you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do.  And he will push us back. So you take the next step  or use the next tool available in what we are putting together  and then he relents. By the third time  in all    cases  we have achieved success. CA  But if it's a       rupee     dollar bribe  what fee would you have to charge  and can you actually make the business work  SM  Well  actually the cost that we incurred was less than     rupees. So  it actually works. CA  That's a high gross margin business. I like it. SM  I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage. CA  OK  so these are provisional numbers  no pricing guarantee. If you can pull this off  you will be a global hero. I mean  this could be huge. Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED. The key question is   When are we going to get fusion   It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion. We've known about fusion since       when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines. I've always been very worried about resource. I don't know about you  but when my mother gave me food  I always sorted the ones I disliked from the ones I liked. And I ate the disliked ones first  because the ones you like  you want to save. And as a child you're always worried about resource. And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources  I got very upset  about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun. Big events in my life  a strange child. Energy  at the moment  is dominated by resource. The countries that make a lot of money out of energy have something underneath them. Coal powered industrial revolution in this country    oil  gas  sorry. Gas  I'm probably the only person who really enjoys it when Mister Putin turns off the gas tap  because my budget goes up. We're really dominated now by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster. And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the Third World  in the developing world  we're using energy faster and faster. And those resources are going away. And the way we'll make energy in the future is not from resource  it's really from knowledge. If you look    years into the future  the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three  with some wind  with some other things  but these are going to be the base load energy drivers. Solar can do it  and we certainly have to develop solar. But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world. Fission. Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations. They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations  and probably more after that. China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is. Because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon free energy. But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is  the perfect energy source is one that doesn't take up much space  has a virtually inexhaustible supply  is safe  doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere  doesn't leave any long lived radioactive waste  it's fusion. But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases. Fusion is very hard to do. We've been trying for    years. Okay. What is fusion  Here comes the nuclear physics. And sorry about that  but this is what turns me on. I was a strange child. Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason. The most stable nucleus is iron  right in the middle of the periodic table. It's a medium sized nucleus. And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy. So  uranium  which is very big  wants to split. But small atoms want to join together  small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron. And you can get energy out this way. And indeed that's exactly what stars do. In the middle of stars  you're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon  to make oxygen  all the things that you're made of are made in the middle of stars. But it's a hard process to do because  as you know  the middle of a star is quite hot  almost by definition. And there is one reaction that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do. It's between two isotopes of hydrogen  two kinds of hydrogen  deuterium  which is heavy hydrogen  which you can get from seawater  and tritium which is super heavy hydrogen. These two nuclei  when they're far apart  are charged. And you push them together and they repel. But when you get them close enough  something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together. So  most of the time they repel. You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together. For a moment they become helium    because they've got five particles inside them. So  that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium  . Helium splits out  and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out. If you can get something to about     million degrees  things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration  this will happen  and it will release energy. And that energy is what powers fusion. And it's this reaction that we want to do. There is one trickiness about this reaction. Well  there is a trickiness that you have to make it     million degrees  but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet. It's pretty hot. The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature. You have to make it from something else. And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom  that's lithium    plus a neutron  will give you more helium  plus tritium. And that's the way you make your tritium. But fortunately  if you can do this fusion reaction  you've got a neutron  so you can make that happen. Now  why the hell would we bother to do this  This is basically why we would bother to do it. If you just plot how much fuel we've got left  in units of present world consumption. And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil    the blue line  by the way  is the lowest estimate of existing resources. And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate. And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years  and perhaps     years of fossil fuels left. And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it  because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air. And then we get to uranium. And with current reactor technology we really don't have very much uranium. And we will have to extract uranium from sea water  which is the yellow line  to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us. This is a bit shocking  because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto  and do all those kind of things. To go any further you would have to have breeder technology. And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous. The big thing  on the right  is the lithium we have in the world. And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line. And we have    million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water. Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion. Is it cost competitive  We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant. And we get within about the same price as current electricity. So  how would we make it  We have to hold something at     million degrees. And  in fact  we've done this. We hold it with a magnetic field. And inside it  right in the middle of this toroidal shape  doughnut shape  right in the middle is     million degrees. It boils away in the middle at     million degrees. And in fact we can make fusion happen. And just down the road  this is JET. It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion. When people say fusion is    years away  and always will be  I say   Yeah  but we've actually done it.  Right  We can do fusion. In the center of this device we made    megawatts of fusion power in     . And in      we're going to fire it up again and break all those records. But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen. We've got to take that  we've got to make that into a fusion reactor. Because we want    million years worth of fusion power for the Earth. This is the device we're building now. It gets very expensive to do this research. It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right  You can't. You have to do it in a very big device. More than half the world's population is involved in building this device in southern France  which is a nice place to put an experiment. Seven nations are involved in building this. It's going to cost us    billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power. But that's not electricity yet. We have to get to this. We have to get to a power plant. We have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology. And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is. But at the moment  all we can imagine is sometime in the     s. I wish this were different. We really need it now. We're going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country. So      looks like an infinity away. But we can't abandon it now  we have to push forward  get fusion to happen. I wish we had more money  I wish we had more resources. But this is what we're aiming at  sometime in the     s    real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much. Namaste. Salaam. Shalom. Sat Sri Akal. Greetings to all of you from Pakistan. It is often said that we fear that which we do not know. And Pakistan  in this particular vein  is very similar. Because it has provoked  and does provoke  a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul  especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens of turbulence and turmoil. But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan. And what follows is a stream of images  a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's most dynamic and young photographers  that aims to give you an alternative glimpse  a look inside the hearts and minds of some ordinary Pakistani citizens. Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you. My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar. I hope that you will be able to see not just my Taliban like beard  but also the richness and color of my perceptions  aspirations and dreams  as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell. My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim. I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that I live near Gilgit  northern Pakistan. My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives through technicolored glass. Madame  would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots  My name is Zamin. And I'm an IDP  an internally displaced person  from Swat. Do you see me on the other side of this fence  Do I matter  or really exist for you  My name is Iman. I am a fashion model  an up and coming model from Lahore. Do you see me simply smothered in cloth  Or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who I truly am inside  My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee from the Khyber agency. I have come from a place of intense darkness. And that is why I want to illuminate the world. My name is Papusay. My heart and drum beat as one. If religion is the opium of the masses  then for me  music is my one and only ganja. A rising tide lifts all boats. And the rising tide of India's spectacular economic growth has lifted over     million Indians into a buoyant middle class. But there are still over     million Indians  Pakistanis  Sri Lankans  Bangladeshis  Nepalese  who remain washed up on the shores of poverty. Therefore as India and Pakistan  as you and I  it behooves us to transcend our differences  to celebrate our diversity  to leverage our common humanity. Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan  which for many of you  as you all recognize  means  new life  in Urdu and Hindi  is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care. Indeed it is the emerging world's first HMO for the urban working poor. Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis  We are but two threads cut from the same cloth. And if our fates are intertwined  then we believe that it is good karma  it is good fortune. And for many of us  our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Fantastic. Just stay up here. That was fantastic. I found that really moving. You know  we fought hard to get at least a small Pakistani contingent to come. It felt like it was really important. They went through a lot to get here. Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please  I just really wanted to acknowledge you. Thank you so much.
