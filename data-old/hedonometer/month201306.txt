 Even in purely non religious terms  homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty. It is a pathetic little second rate substitute for reality    a pitiable flight from life. As such  it deserves no compassion  it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom  and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness.  That's from Time magazine in       when I was three years old. And last year  the president of the United States came out in favor of gay marriage. And my question is  how did we get from there to here  How did an illness become an identity  When I was perhaps six years old  I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother. And at the end of buying our shoes  the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home. My brother wanted a red balloon  and I wanted a pink balloon. My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon. But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one. And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue. The fact that my favorite color now is blue  but I'm still gay    is evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits. When I was little  my mother used to say   The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world. And until you have children  you don't know what it's like.  And when I was little  I took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me. And when I was an adolescent  I thought that I'm gay  and so I probably can't have a family. And when she said it  it made me anxious. And after I came out of the closet  when she continued to say it  it made me furious. I said   I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in. And I want you to stop saying that.  About    years ago  I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine to write a piece about deaf culture. And I was rather taken aback. I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness. Those poor people  they couldn't hear. They lacked hearing  and what could we do for them  And then I went out into the deaf world. I went to deaf clubs. I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry. I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville  Tennessee where people complained about that slurry Southern signing. And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world  I become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said   We don't lack hearing  we have membership in a culture   were saying something that was viable. It wasn't my culture  and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it  but I appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it  it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture. It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture. Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf. And when her daughter was born  she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me. She was facing the question of what to do with this child. Should she say   You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter   Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity  get involved in the Little People of America  become aware of what was happening for dwarfs  And I suddenly thought  most deaf children are born to hearing parents. Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them. Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence. Most gay people are born to straight parents. Those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world  and those gay people have to discover identity later on. And here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter. And I thought  there it is again  A family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary. And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity. There are vertical identities  which are passed down generationally from parent to child. Those are things like ethnicity  frequently nationality  language  often religion. Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children. And while some of them can be difficult  there's no attempt to cure them. You can argue that it's harder in the United States    our current presidency notwithstanding    to be a person of color. And yet  we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to African Americans and Asians come out with creamy skin and yellow hair. There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group. And I call them horizontal identities  because the peer group is the horizontal experience. These are identities that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers. And those identities  those horizontal identities  people have almost always tried to cure. And I wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identities come to a good relationship with them. And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place. There's self acceptance  there's family acceptance  and there's social acceptance. And they don't always coincide. And a lot of the time  people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don't love them  when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them. Love is something that ideally is there unconditionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child. But acceptance is something that takes time. It always takes time. One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown. When he was born  he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism  a very disabling condition  and his parents were told that he would never walk  he would never talk  he would have no intellectual capacity  and he would probably not even recognize them. And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly. And his mother said she wasn't going to do it. And she took her son home. And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages  she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism  and she got Clinton enrolled with him. And in the course of his childhood  he had    major surgical procedures. And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures  as a result of which he now can walk. And while he was there  they sent tutors around to help him with his school work. And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do. And he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family. He was the first one in his family  in fact  to go to college  where he lived on campus and drove a specially fitted car that accommodated his unusual body. And his mother told me this story of coming home one day    and he went to college nearby    and she said   I saw that car  which you can always recognize  in the parking lot of a bar   she said.  Laughter   And I thought to myself  they're six feet tall  he's three feet tall. Two beers for them is four beers for him.  She said   I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him  but I went home  and I left him eight messages on his cell phone.  She said   And then I thought  if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies      And I said to her   What do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming  accomplished  wonderful person   And she said   What did I do  I loved him  that's all. Clinton just always had that light in him. And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there.  I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '  s. This one is from         The Atlantic Monthly  voice of liberal America    written by an important bioethicist. He said   There is no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down syndrome child away  whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible  lethal sense. It is sad  yes    dreadful. But it carries no guilt. True guilt arises only from an offense against a person  and a Down's is not a person.  There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made in the treatment of gay people. The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day. But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences  how we used to see people who were disabled  how inhuman we held people to be. And the change that's been accomplished there  which is almost equally radical  is one that we pay not very much attention to. One of the families I interviewed  Tom and Karen Robards  were taken aback when  as young and successful New Yorkers  their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome. They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be  and so they decided they would build a little center    two classrooms that they started with a few other parents    to educate kids with D.S. And over the years  that center grew into something called the Cooke Center  where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught. In the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran  the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled. The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors  those who are writers  some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood. The Robards had a lot to do with that. And I said   Do you regret it  Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome  Do you wish you'd never heard of it   And interestingly his father said   Well  for David  our son  I regret it  because for David  it's a difficult way to be in the world  and I'd like to give David an easier life. But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome  it would be a catastrophic loss.  And Karen Robards said to me   I'm with Tom. For David  I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life. But speaking for myself    well  I would never have believed    years ago when he was born that I could come to such a point    speaking for myself  it's made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life  that speaking for myself  I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world.  We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up. And yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before. Most deaf infants born in the United States now will receive Cochlear implants  which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver  and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech. A compound that has been tested in mice  BMN      is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism  and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene  grow to full size. Testing in humans is around the corner. There are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before  making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies  or to terminate them. And so we have both social progress and medical progress. And I believe in both of them. I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful  and I think the same thing about the medical progress. But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other. And when I see the way they're intersecting in conditions like the three I've just described  I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan. We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether. And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is  what do we validate in our children  and what do we cure in them  Jim Sinclair  a prominent autism activist  said   When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism ' what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist and I had a different  non autistic child instead.' Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence. This is what we hear when you pray for a cure    that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces.  It's a very extreme point of view  but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated. They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be. One of the families I interviewed for this project was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre. It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me  and once they agreed  they were so full of their story that they couldn't stop telling it. And the first weekend I spent with them    the first of many    I recorded more than    hours of conversation. And on Sunday night  we were all exhausted. We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner. And I said   If Dylan were here now  do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him   And his father said   I sure do. I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing.  And Sue looked at the floor  and she thought for a minute. And then she looked back up and said   I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head.  When I had dinner with her a couple of years later    one of many dinners that we had together    she said   You know  when it first happened  I used to wish that I had never married  that I had never had children. If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom  this child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened. But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much that I don't want to imagine a life without them. I recognize the pain they caused to others  for which there can be no forgiveness  but the pain they caused to me  there is   she said.  So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world if Dylan had never been born  I've decided that it would not have been better for me.  I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems  problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid  and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting. And then I thought  all of us who have children love the children we have  with their flaws. If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children I have and give me other  better children    more polite  funnier  nicer  smarter    I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle. And ultimately I feel that in the same way that we test flame retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove  so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting  which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think  where did you come from  It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed    there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia  there are only so many families of children who are transgender  there are only so many families of prodigies    who also face similar challenges in many ways    there are only so many families in each of those categories    but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing  then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon. Ironically  it turns out  that it's our differences  and our negotiation of difference  that unite us. I decided to have children while I was working on this project. And many people were astonished and said   But how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong   And I said   I'm not studying everything that can go wrong. What I'm studying is how much love there can be  even when everything appears to be going wrong.  I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen  a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect. And when his ashes were interred  his mother said   I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed  once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved.  And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so. So my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis. I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children. And so she and I have a daughter  and mother and daughter live in Texas. And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time of whom I am the biological father  and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura  the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis. So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states. And there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family. And there are people who think that families like mine shouldn't be allowed to exist. And I don't accept subtractive models of love  only additive ones. And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on  so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness. The day after our son was born  the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned. He wasn't extending his legs appropriately. She said that might mean that he had brain damage. In so far as he was extending them  he was doing so asymmetrically  which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action. And he had a very large head  which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus. And as she told me all of these things  I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor. And I thought  here I had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled  and I didn't want to join their number. Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness. And like all parents since the dawn of time  I wanted to protect my child from illness. And I wanted also to protect myself from illness. And yet  I knew from the work I had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for  that those would ultimately be his identity  and if they were his identity they would become my identity  that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded. We took him to the MRI machine  we took him to the CAT scanner  we took this day old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw. We felt helpless. And at the end of five hours  they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly. And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on  she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp. But I thought how my mother was right. I thought  the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world  and until you have children  you don't know what it feels like. I think children had ensnared me the moment I connected fatherhood with loss. But I'm not sure I would have noticed that if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine. I'd encountered so much strange love  and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns. And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities. During these    years  I had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility  and I had come to see how it conquers everything else. And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools  enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children and trying to breed identity out of misery  I realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that I was ready to join them on their ship. Thank you. How many of you have checked your email today  Come on  raise your hands. How many of you are checking it right now  And how about finances  Anybody check that today  Credit card  investment account  How about this week  Now  how about your household energy use  Anybody check that today  This week  Last week  A few energy geeks spread out across the room. It's good to see you guys. But the rest of us    this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet  and even we aren't paying attention to the energy use that's driving climate change. The woman in the photo with me is Harriet. We met her on our first family vacation. Harriet's paying attention to her energy use  and she is decidedly not an energy geek. This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention. This is coal  the most common source of electricity on the planet  and there's enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year. But unfortunately  between here and here  most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat. In fact  only    percent ends up as light. So this coal will last a little bit more than a month. If you wanted to light this bulb for a year  you'd need this much coal. The bad news here is that  for every unit of energy we use  we waste nine. That means there's good news  because for every unit of energy we save  we save the other nine. So the question is  how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we're using  and start wasting less of it  The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer     years ago  and only    miles from here  in San Marcos  California. Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood  asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans. One quarter of the homes received a message that said  did you know you could save    dollars a month this summer  Turn off your air conditioning  turn on your fans. Another group got an environmental message. And still a third group got a message about being good citizens  preventing blackouts. Most people guessed that money saving message would work best of all. In fact  none of these messages worked. They had zero impact on energy consumption. It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all. But there was a fourth message  and this message simply said   When surveyed     percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans. Please join them. Turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans.  And wouldn't you know it  they did. The people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing. So what does this tell us  Well  if something is inconvenient  even if we believe in it  moral suasion  financial incentives  don't do much to move us    but social pressure  that's powerful stuff. And harnessed correctly  it can be a powerful force for good. In fact  it already is. Inspired by this insight  my friend Dan Yates and I started a company called Opower. We built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy. We deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar sized homes. Just like those effective door hangers  we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors  and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save. We started with paper  we moved to a mobile application  web  and now even a controllable thermostat  and for the last five years we've been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world. And it's working. Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than     million dollars on their energy bills  and we're just getting started. This year alone  in partnership with more than    utilities in six countries  we're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings. Now  the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours  but for the rest of us  two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined for more than a year. Two terawatt hours  it's roughly half what the U.S. solar industry produced last year. And two terawatt hours  In terms of coal  we'd need to burn    of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity. And we're not burning anything. We're just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior. But we're just one company  and this is just scratching the surface. Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted  and when I say wasted  I don't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs. They may. I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms  and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home. That's    billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well being but does contribute to climate change. That's    billion    with a B    every year in the U.S. alone. That's half our coal usage right there. Now thankfully  some of the world's best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these  and this is both fantastic and essential. But the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future  it isn't on this slide. It's in this room. It's you  and it's me. And we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavioral science. We can do it today  we know it works  and it will save us money right away. So what are we waiting for  Well  in most places  utility regulation hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison. Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy. They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it. But this story is much more than about household energy use. Take a look at the Prius. It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science. The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy they're saving in real time makes former speed demons drive more like cautious grandmothers. Which brings us back to Harriet. We met her on our first family vacation. She came over to meet my young daughter  and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name is also Harriet. She asked me what I did for a living  and I told her  I work with utilities to help people save energy. It was then that her eyes lit up. She looked at me  and she said   You're exactly the person I need to talk to. You see  two weeks ago  my husband and I got a letter in the mail from our utility. It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors.   And for the last two weeks  all we can think about  talk about  and even argue about  is what we should be doing to save energy. We did everything that letter told us to do  and still I know there must be more. Now I'm here with a genuine expert. Tell me. What should I do to save energy   There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question. My goal is to make sure we are all asking it. Thank you. I am sorry I cannot show you my face  because if I do  the bad guys will come for me. My journey started    years ago. I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college. Then I got a scoop. The scoop was quite a very simple story. Police officers were taking bribes from hawkers who were hawking on the streets. As a young reporter  I thought that I should do it in a different way  so that it has a maximum impact  since everybody knew that it was happening  and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system. So I decided to go there and act as a seller. As part of selling  I was able to document the hard core evidence. The impact was great. It was fantastic. This was what many call immersion journalism  or undercover journalism. I am an undercover journalist. My journalism is hinged on three basic principles  naming  shaming and jailing. Journalism is about results. It's about affecting your community or your society in the most progressive way. I have worked on this for over    years  and I can tell you  the results are very good. One story that comes to mind in my undercover pieces is  Spirit Child.  It was about children who were born with deformities  and their parents felt that once they were born with those deformities  they were not good enough to live in the society  so they were given some concoction to take and as a result they died. So I built a prosthetic baby  and I went into the village  pretended as though this baby had been born with a deformity  and here was the guys who do the killing. They got themselves ready. In their bids to kill  I got the police on standby  and they came that fateful morning to come and kill the child. I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction. They put it on fire. It was boiling hot  getting ready to give to the kids. Whilst this was going on  the police I had alerted  they were on standby  and just as the concoction was ready  and they were about to give it to the kids  I phoned the police  and fortunately they came and busted them. As I speak now  they are before the courts. Don't forget the key principles  naming  shaming and jailing. The court process is taking place  and I'm very sure at the end of the day we will find them  and we will put them where they belong too. Another key story that comes to mind  which relates to this spirit child phenomenon  is  The Spell of the Albinos.  I'm sure most of you may have heard  in Tanzania  children who are born with albinism are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society. Their bodies are chopped up with machetes and are supposed to be used for some concoctions or some potions for people to get money    or so many  many stories people would tell about it. It was time to go undercover again. So I went undercover as a man who was interested in this particular business  of course. Again  a prosthetic arm was built. For the first time  I filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this  and they were ready to buy the arm and they were ready to use it to prepare those potions for people. I am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action  but the key issue is that the Tanzanian government could only take action because the evidence was available. My journalism is about hard core evidence. If I say you have stolen  I show you the evidence that you have stolen. I show you how you stole it and when  or what you used what you had stolen to do. What is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society  My kind of journalism is a product of my society. I know that sometimes people have their own criticisms about undercover journalism. and put it on the table  so that we should not be afraid. He wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire. So with my hidden intention  I kept quiet. I didn't utter a word. But my colleagues didn't know. So after collecting the money  when he left  we were waiting for him to bring the goods. Immediately after he left  I told my colleagues that since I was the leader of the group  I told my colleagues that if they come  we will arrest them. Second official  I don't even know the place called  unclear . I've never stepped there before. So I'm surprised. You see a hand counting money just in front of me. The next moment  you see the money in my hands  counting  whereas I have not come into contact with anybody. I have not done any business with anybody. Reporter  When Metro News contacted investigative reporter Anas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction  he just smiled and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen. The officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled. Anas Aremeyaw Anas  This was another story on anticorruption. And here was him  denying. But you see  when you have the hard core evidence  you are able to affect society. Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come.  Music   I will curse Anas to death   Anas Lies   Alarm Blows Over Anas' News for Cash Video   Agenda Against Top CEPS Officials Exposed   Anas Operates with Invisible Powers    Gov't Wobbles Over Anas Video   Hunting the Hunter   Anas 'Bribe' Men in Court      Heads Roll Over Anas Tape   Finance Minister Backs Anas      Given Queries Over Anas' Story   GJA Stands By Anas   Prez. Mills Storms Tema Harbour Over Anas Video    Late Prof. John Evans Atta Mills  Former president of Ghana   John Evans Atta Mills  What Anas says is not something which is unknown to many of us  but please  those of you who are agents  and who are leading the customs officers into temptation  I'm telling you  Ghana is not going to say any good things to you about this. AAA  That was my president. I thought that I couldn't come here without giving you something special. I have a piece  and I'm excited that I'm sharing it for the first time with you here. I have been undercover in the prisons. I have been there for a long time. And I can tell you  what I saw is not nice. But again  I can only affect society and affect government if I bring out the hard core evidence. Many times  the prison authorities have denied ever having issues of drug abuse  issues of sodomy  so many issues they would deny that it ever happens. How can you obtain the hard core evidence  So I was in the prison.   Nsawan Prison   Now  what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies. Now  I happen to have followed one of my inmates  one of my friends  from his sick bed till death  and I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all. There were issues of bad food being served as I recall that some of the food I ate is just not good for a human being. Toilet facilities  very bad. I mean  you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend    and that's what I call proper  when four of us are on a manhole. It is something that if you narrate it to somebody  the person wouldn't believe it. The only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hard core evidence. Of course  drugs were abundant. It was easier to get cannabis  heroin and cocaine  faster even  in the prison than outside the prison. Evil in the society is an extreme disease. If you have extreme diseases  you need to get extreme remedies. My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries  but I can tell you  it works in my part of the continent of Africa  because usually  when people talk about corruption  they ask   Where is the evidence  Show me the evidence.  I say   This is the evidence.  And that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars. You see  we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions. That is why I was particularly excited when we launched our  Africa Investigates  series where we investigated a lot of African countries. As a result of the success of the  Africa Investigates  series  we are moving on to World Investigates. By the end of it  a lot more bad guys on our continent will be put behind bars. This will not stop. I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism  because I know that when evil men destroy  good men must build and bind. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. I have some questions for you. How did you end up in jail  This was just a few weeks ago  I believe  yeah  AAA  Sure. You know  undercover is all about setting the priorities right  so we got people to take me to court. So I went through the very legal process  because at the end of the day  the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not  and that's how I got in there. CA  So someone sued you in court  and they took you there  and you were in remand custody for part of it  and you did that deliberately. AAA  Yes  yes. CA  Talk to me just about fear and how you manage that  because you're regularly putting your life at risk. How do you do that  AAA  You see  undercover is always a last resort. Before we go undercover  we follow the rules. And I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear whenever I am sure that all the steps have been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team who help ensure that the safety and all the systems are put in place  but you've got to take very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening. If you don't  you will end up losing your life. So yes  when the backup systems are put in place  I'm okay  I go in. Risky  yes  but it's a hazard of a profession. I mean  everybody has their hazard. And once you say that is yours  you've got to take it  as and when it comes. CA  Well  you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work and you've taught us a story like no story I think any of us have heard before. And we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much  Anas. AAA  Thank you. CA  Thank you. Stay safe.  Applause  Well  now we're going to the Bahamas to meet a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with in the wild for the last    years. Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains and what they might be doing with all that brainpower in the wild. And we know they use some of that brainpower for just living complicated lives  but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence  Well  we know a few things. We know that their brain to body ratio  which is a physical measure of intelligence  is second only to humans. Cognitively  they can understand artificially created languages. And they pass self awareness tests in mirrors. And in some parts of the world  they use tools  like sponges to hunt fish. But there's one big question left  do they have a language  and if so  what are they talking about  So decades ago  not years ago  I set out to find a place in the world where I could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system. Now in most parts of the world  the water's pretty murky  so it's very hard to observe animals underwater  but I found a community of dolphins that live in these beautiful  clear  shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas which are just east of Florida. And they spend their daytime resting and socializing in the safety of the shallows  but at night  they go off the edge and hunt in deep water. Now  it's not a bad place to be a researcher  either. So we go out for about five months every summer in a    meter catamaran  and we live  sleep and work at sea for weeks at a time. My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone  which is an underwater microphone  and this is so I can correlate sound and behavior. And most of our work's pretty non invasive. We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water  since we're actually observing them physically in the water. Now  Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species to work with for a couple of reasons. They're born without spots  and they get spots with age  and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases  so that's fun to track their behavior. And by about the age of     they're fully spotted black and white. Now the mother you see here is Mugsy. She's    years old in this shot  but dolphins can actually live into their early   s. And like all the dolphins in our community  we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots and nicks in her dorsal fin  and also the unique spot patterns as she matured over time. Now  young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up  and they use their teenage years to practice social skills  and at about the age of nine  the females become sexually mature  so they can get pregnant  and the males mature quite a bit later  at around    years of age. And dolphins are very promiscuous  and so we have to determine who the fathers are  so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material out of the water and extracting DNA. So what that means is  after    years  we are tracking three generations  including grandmothers and grandfathers. Now  dolphins are natural acousticians. They make sounds    times as high and hear sounds    times as high as we do. But they have other communication signals they use. They have good vision  so they use body postures to communicate. They have taste  not smell. And they have touch. And sound can actually be felt in the water  because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same. So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance. Now  we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors. Now  the signature whistle is a whistle that's specific to an individual dolphin  and it's like a name.  Dolphin whistling noises  And this is the best studied sound  because it's easy to measure  really  and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves are reuniting  for example. Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks. This is the dolphin's sonar.  Dolphin echolocation noises  And they use these clicks to hunt and feed. But they can also tightly pack these clicks together into buzzes and use them socially. For example  males will stimulate a female during a courtship chase. You know  I've been buzzed in the water. Don't tell anyone. It's a secret. And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that. So dolphins are also political animals  so they have to resolve conflicts. And they use these burst pulsed sounds as well as their head to head behaviors when they're fighting. And these are very unstudied sounds because they're hard to measure. Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight. So you're going to see two groups  and you're going to see the head to head posturing  some open mouths  lots of squawking. There's a bubble. And basically  one of these groups will kind of back off and everything will resolve fine  and it doesn't really escalate into violence too much. Now  in the Bahamas  we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins. For example  they babysit each other's calves. The males have dominance displays that they use when they're chasing each other's females. And the two species actually form temporary alliances when they're chasing sharks away. And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate their coordination is synchrony. They synchronize their sounds and their body postures to look bigger and sound stronger. Now  these are bottlenose dolphins  and you'll see them starting to synchronize their behavior and their sounds. You see  they're synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad. I wish I was that coordinated. Now  it's important to remember that you're only hearing the human audible parts of dolphin sounds  and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds  and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds. Now  researchers have actually measured whistle complexity using information theory  and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages. But burst pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery. Now  these are three spectragrams. Two are human words  and one is a dolphin vocalizing. So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin. Now  it turns out burst pulsed sounds actually look a bit like human phonemes. Now  one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean  but it's a difficult job  and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet. But a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology  an interface to do two way communication  and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas and in real time. Now  scientists have used keyboard interfaces to try to bridge the gap with species including chimpanzees and dolphins. This underwater keyboard in Orlando  Florida  at the Epcot Center  was actually the most sophisticated ever two way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information. So we wanted to develop an interface like this in the Bahamas  but in a more natural setting. And one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us a lot of mutual curiosity. They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations and our postures  and they were also inviting us into dolphin games. Now  dolphins are social mammals  so they love to play  and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed  or sargassum in this case  around. And they're very adept. They like to drag it and drop it from appendage to appendage. Now in this footage  the adult is Caroh. She's    years old here  and this is her newborn  Cobalt  and he's just learning how to play this game. She's kind of teasing him and taunting him. He really wants that sargassum. Now  when dolphins solicit humans for this game  they'll often sink vertically in the water  and they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper  and they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes on the bottom and let us go get it  and then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game. But when we don't dive down and get it  they'll bring it to the surface and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail and drop it for us like they do their calves  and then we'll pick it up and have a game. And so we started thinking  well  wouldn't it be neat to build some technology that would allow the dolphins to request these things in real time  their favorite toys  So the original vision was to have a keyboard hanging from the boat attached to a computer  and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys on the keypad and happily exchange information and request toys from each other. But we quickly found out that dolphins simply were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard. They've got better things to do in the wild. They might do it in captivity  but in the wild    So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water  and we labeled four objects they like to play with  the scarf  rope  sargassum  and also had a bow ride  which is a fun activity for a dolphin.  Whistle  And that's the scarf whistle  which is also associated with a visual symbol. And these are artificially created whistles. They're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire  but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins. And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour  working out in the field with this keyboard using it with each other to do requests for toys while the dolphins were watching. And the dolphins could get in on the game. They could point at the visual object  or they could mimic the whistle. Now this is video of a session. The diver here has a rope toy  and I'm on the keyboard on the left  and I've just played the rope key  and that's the request for the toy from the human. So I've got the rope  I'm diving down  and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention  because they're kind of like little kids. You have to keep their attention. I'm going to drop the rope  see if they come over. Here they come  and then they're going to pick up the rope and drag it around as a toy. Now  I'm at the keyboard on the left  and this is actually the first time that we tried this. I'm going to try to request this toy  the rope toy  from the dolphins using the rope sound. Let's see if they might actually understand what that means. That's the rope whistle. Up come the dolphins  and drop off the rope  yay. Wow. So this is only once. We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles. Okay  so here's a second toy in the water. This is a scarf toy  and I'm trying to lead the dolphin over to the keyboard to show her the visual and the acoustic signal. Now this dolphin  we call her  the scarf thief   because over the years she's absconded with about    scarves. In fact  we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas. So I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side. And we try to not touch the animals too much  we really don't want to over habituate them. And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard. And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound to request the scarf. So I try to give her the scarf. Whoop. Almost lost it. But this is the moment where everything becomes possible. The dolphin's at the keyboard. You've got full attention. And this sometimes went on for hours. And I wanted to share this video with you not to show you any big breakthroughs  because they haven't happened yet  but to show you the level of intention and focus that these dolphins have  and interest in the system. And because of this  we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology. So we joined forces with Georgia Tech  with Thad Starner's wearable computing group  to build us an underwater wearable computer that we're calling CHAT.  CHAT  Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry  Now  instead of pushing a keyboard through the water  the diver's wearing the complete system  and it's acoustic only  so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad on the forearm  the sounds go out through an underwater speaker  if a dolphin mimics the whistle or a human plays the whistle  the sounds come in and are localized by two hydrophones. The computer can localize who requested the toy if there's a word match. And the real power of the system is in the real time sound recognition  so we can respond to the dolphins quickly and accurately. And we're at prototype stage  but this is how we hope it will play out. So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle  the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water  but also as a word through bone conduction. So Diver A plays the scarf whistle or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle to request a toy from whoever has it. What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle  and if Diver A has the sargassum  if that's the sound that was played and requested  then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin and they'll swim away happily into the sunset playing sargassum for forever. Now  how far can this kind of communication go  Well  CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins to request things from us. It's designed to really be two way. Now  will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally  We hope so and we think so. But as we decode their natural sounds  we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system. For example  right now we can put their own signature whistles in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin. Likewise  we can create our own whistles  our own whistle names  and let the dolphins request specific divers to interact with. Now it may be that all our mobile technology will actually be the same technology that helps us communicate with another species down the road. In the case of a dolphin  you know  it's a species that  well  they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways and we might not be able to admit that right now  but they live in quite a different environment  and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems. I mean  imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet. Thank you. I made a film that was impossible to make  but I didn't know it was impossible  and that's how I was able to do it.  Mars et Avril  is a science fiction film. It's set in Montreal some    years in the future. No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before because it's expensive  it's set in the future  and it's got tons of visual effects  and it's shot on green screen. Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make ever since I was a kid  really  back when I was reading some comic books and dreaming about what the future might be. When American producers see my film  they think that I had a big budget to do it  like    million. But in fact I had    percent of that budget. I did  Mars et Avril  for only  .  million. So you might wonder  what's the deal here  How did I do this  Well  it's two things. First  it's time. When you don't have money  you must take time  and it took me seven years to do  Mars et Avril.  The second aspect is love. I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved. And it seems like every department had nothing  so they had to rely on our creativity and turn every problem into an opportunity. And that brings me to the point of my talk  actually  how constraints  big creative constraints  can boost creativity. But let me go back in time a bit. In my early   s  I did some graphic novels  but they weren't your usual graphic novels. They were books telling a science fiction story through images and text  and most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation  they were already involved in these books portraying characters into a sort of experimental  theatrical  simplistic way. And one of these actors is the great stage director and actor Robert Lepage. And I just love this guy. I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid. His career I admire a lot. And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project  and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of Eug ne Spaak  who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time  space  love  music and women. And he was a perfect fit for the part  and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance. He was the one who believed in me and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books into a film  and to write  direct  and produce the film myself. And Robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity. Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet. I mean  his agenda is booked until       and he's really hard to get  and I wanted him to be in the movie  to reprise his role in the movie. But the thing is  had I waited for him until       my film wouldn't be a futuristic film anymore  so I just couldn't do that. Right  But that's kind of a big problem. How do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie  Well  I said as a joke in a production meeting    and this is a true story  by the way   I said   Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram  Because  you know  he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time  and he's an illuminated being in my mind  and he's in between reality and virtual reality  so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram.  Everybody around the table laughed  but the joke was kind of a good solution  so that's what we ended up doing. Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras. He was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium. Each camera was covering    degrees of his head  so that in post production we could use pretty much any angle we needed  and we shot only his head. Six months later there was a guy on set  a mime portraying the body  the vehicle for the head. And he was wearing a green hood so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with Robert Lepage's head. So he became like a renaissance man  and here's what it looks like in the movie. didn't account for the technical challenges. I welded the breech  but the valve is still gaping. I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box  but I might have hit a heartstring. It still sounds too low.  Jacques Languirand   That's normal. The instrument always ends up resembling its model.  Martin Villeneuve  Now these musical instruments that you see in this excerpt  they're my second example of how constraints can boost creativity  because I desperately needed these objects in my movie. They are objects of desire. They are imaginary musical instruments. And they carry a nice story with them. Actually  I knew what these things would look like in my mind for many  many years. But my problem was  I didn't have the money to pay for them. I couldn't afford them. So that's kind of a big problem too. How do you get something that you can't afford  And  you know  I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea. I said   What if I have somebody else pay for them   But who on Earth would be interested by seven not yet built musical instruments inspired by women's bodies  And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal  because who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen  So I found my way to Guy Lalibert   Cirque du Soleil's CEO  and I presented my crazy idea to him with sketches like this and visual references  and something pretty amazing happened. Guy was interested by this idea not because I was asking for his money  but because I came to him with a good idea in which everybody was happy. It was kind of a perfect triangle in which the art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price  because they weren't even made. He took a leap of faith. And the artist  Dominique Engel  brilliant guy  he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year. And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments in my film for free  which was kind of what I tried to do. So here they are. And my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from the green  because this is a weird color  a crazy color  and you need to replace the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later. And I had  again  pretty much  ideas in my mind as to what the world would be  but then again I turned to my childhood imagination and went to the work of Belgian comic book master Fran ois Schuiten in Belgium. And this guy is another guy I admire a lot  and I wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer. But people told me  you know  Martin  it's impossible  the guy is too busy and he will say no. Well  I said  you know what  instead of mimicking his style  I might as well call the real guy and ask him  and I sent him my books  and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium. In other words  there was space for him to dream with me. So here I was with one of my childhood heroes  drawing every single frame that's in the film to turn that into Montreal in the future. And it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom I admire. But then  you know  eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality. So  again  my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that I could think of. And there's this guy in Montreal  another Quebecois called Carlos Monzon  and he's a very good VFX artist. This guy had been lead compositor on such films as  Avatar  and  Star Trek  and  Transformers   and other unknown projects like this  and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job  and I had to convince him  and  instead of working on the next Spielberg movie  he accepted to work on mine. Why  Because I offered him a space to dream. So if you don't have money to offer to people  you must strike their imagination with something as nice as you can think of. So this is what happened on this movie  and that's how it got made  and we went to this very nice postproduction company in Montreal called Vision Globale  and they lent their    artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film. So I want to tell you that  if you have some crazy ideas in your mind  and that people tell you that it's impossible to make  well  that's an even better reason to want to do it  because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the final result  whereas if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents  life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way. I have experienced it. And you might end up doing some crazy projects  and who knows  you might even end up going to Mars. Thank you. The writer George Eliot cautioned us that  among all forms of mistake  prophesy is the most gratuitous. The person that we would all acknowledge as her   th century counterpart  Yogi Berra  agreed. He said   It's tough to make predictions  especially about the future.  I'm going to ignore their cautions and make one very specific forecast. In the world that we are creating very quickly  we're going to see more and more things that look like science fiction  and fewer and fewer things that look like jobs. Our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves  which means we're going to need fewer truck drivers. We're going to hook Siri up to Watson and use that to automate a lot of the work that's currently done by customer service reps and troubleshooters and diagnosers  and we're already taking R D   painting him orange  and putting him to work carrying shelves around warehouses  which means we need a lot fewer people to be walking up and down those aisles. Now  for about     years  people have been saying exactly what I'm telling you    the age of technological unemployment is at hand   starting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain just about two centuries ago  and they have been wrong. Our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment. Which brings up a critical question  Why is this time different  if it really is  The reason it's different is that  just in the past few years  our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never  ever had before  understanding  speaking  hearing  seeing  answering  writing  and they're still acquiring new skills. For example  mobile humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive  but the research arm of the Defense Department just launched a competition to have them do things like this  and if the track record is any guide  this competition is going to be successful. So when I look around  I think the day is not too far off at all when we're going to have androids doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now. And we're creating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs. It's a world that Erik Brynjolfsson and I are calling  the new machine age.  The thing to keep in mind is that this is absolutely great news. This is the best economic news on the planet these days. Not that there's a lot of competition  right  This is the best economic news we have these days for two main reasons. The first is  technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we're on where output goes up over time  while at the same time  prices go down  and volume and quality just continue to explode. Now  some people look at this and talk about shallow materialism  but that's absolutely the wrong way to look at it. This is abundance  which is exactly what we want our economic system to provide. The second reason that the new machine age is such great news is that  once the androids start doing jobs  we don't have to do them anymore  and we get freed up from drudgery and toil. Now  when I talk about this with my friends in Cambridge and Silicon Valley  they say   Fantastic. No more drudgery  no more toil. This gives us the chance to imagine an entirely different kind of society  a society where the creators and the discoverers and the performers and the innovators come together with their patrons and their financiers to talk about issues  entertain  enlighten  provoke each other.  It's a society really  that looks a lot like the TED Conference. And there's actually a huge amount of truth here. We are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place. In a world where it is just about as easy to generate an object as it is to print a document  we have amazing new possibilities. The people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists are now makers  and they're responsible for massive amounts of innovation. And artists who were formerly constrained can now do things that were never  ever possible for them before. So this is a time of great flourishing  and the more I look around  the more convinced I become that this quote  from the physicist Freeman Dyson  is not hyperbole at all. This is just a plain statement of the facts. We are in the middle of an astonishing period.   Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations  of arts and of sciences.    Freeman Dyson  Which brings up another great question  What could possibly go wrong in this new machine age  Right  Great  hang up  flourish  go home. We're going to face two really thorny sets of challenges as we head deeper into the future that we're creating. The first are economic  and they're really nicely summarized in an apocryphal story about a back and forth between Henry Ford II and Walter Reuther  who was the head of the auto workers union. They were touring one of the new modern factories  and Ford playfully turns to Reuther and says   Hey Walter  how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues   And Reuther shoots back   Hey Henry  how are you going to get them to buy cars   Reuther's problem in that anecdote is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy that's full of machines  and we see this very clearly in the statistics. If you look over the past couple decades at the returns to capital    in other words  corporate profits    we see them going up  and we see that they're now at an all time high. If we look at the returns to labor  in other words total wages paid out in the economy  we see them at an all time low and heading very quickly in the opposite direction. So this is clearly bad news for Reuther. It looks like it might be great news for Ford  but it's actually not. If you want to sell huge volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people  you really want a large  stable  prosperous middle class. We have had one of those in America for just about the entire postwar period. But the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now. We all know a lot of the statistics  but just to repeat one of them  median income in America has actually gone down over the past    years  and we're in danger of getting trapped in some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization continue to go up over time. The societal challenges that come along with that kind of inequality deserve some attention. There are a set of societal challenges that I'm actually not that worried about  and they're captured by images like this. This is not the kind of societal problem that I am concerned about. There is no shortage of dystopian visions about what happens when our machines become self aware  and they decide to rise up and coordinate attacks against us. I'm going to start worrying about those the day my computer becomes aware of my printer. So this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about. To tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age  I want to tell a story about two stereotypical American workers. And to make them really stereotypical  let's make them both white guys. And the first one is a college educated professional  creative type  manager  engineer  doctor  lawyer  that kind of worker. We're going to call him  Ted.  He's at the top of the American middle class. His counterpart is not college educated and works as a laborer  works as a clerk  does low level white collar or blue collar work in the economy. We're going to call that guy  Bill.  And if you go back about    years  Bill and Ted were leading remarkably similar lives. For example  in      they were both very likely to have full time jobs  working at least    hours a week. But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented  as we started to automate the economy  and      is just about when computers started to be used by businesses  as we started to progressively inject technology and automation and digital stuff into the economy  the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot. Over this time frame  Ted has continued to hold a full time job. Bill hasn't. In many cases  Bill has left the economy entirely  and Ted very rarely has. Over time  Ted's marriage has stayed quite happy. Bill's hasn't. And Ted's kids have grown up in a two parent home  while Bill's absolutely have not over time. Other ways that Bill is dropping out of society  He's decreased his voting in presidential elections  and he's started to go to prison a lot more often. So I cannot tell a happy story about these social trends  and they don't show any signs of reversing themselves. They're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at  and they're actually getting so severe that they're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement. And what my friends in Silicon Valley and Cambridge are overlooking is that they're Ted. They're living these amazingly busy  productive lives  and they've got all the benefits to show from that  while Bill is leading a very different life. They're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was when he talked about the benefits of work  and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils.   Work saves a man from three great evils  boredom  vice and need.    Voltaire  So with these challenges  what do we do about them  The economic playbook is surprisingly clear  surprisingly straightforward  in the short term especially. The robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two  so the classic Econ     playbook is going to work just fine  Encourage entrepreneurship  double down on infrastructure  and make sure we're turning out people from our educational system with the appropriate skills. But over the longer term  if we are moving into an economy that's heavy on technology and light on labor  and we are  then we have to consider some more radical interventions  for example  something like a guaranteed minimum income. Now  that's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable  because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth. I did a little bit of research on this notion  and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those frothing at the mouth socialists Friedrich Hayek  Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman. And if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent  you might be interested to know that social mobility  one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States  is now lower than it is in the northern European countries that have these very generous social safety nets. So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward. The societal one is a lot more challenging. I don't know what the playbook is for getting Bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life. I do know that education is a huge part of it. I witnessed this firsthand. I was a Montessori kid for the first few years of my education  and what that education taught me is that the world is an interesting place and my job is to go explore it. The school stopped in third grade  so then I entered the public school system  and it felt like I had been sent to the Gulag. With the benefit of hindsight  I now know the job was to prepare me for life as a clerk or a laborer  but at the time it felt like the job was to kind of bore me into some submission with what was going on around me. We have to do better than this. We cannot keep turning out Bills. So we see some green shoots that things are getting better. We see technology deeply impacting education and engaging people  from our youngest learners up to our oldest ones. We see very prominent business voices telling us we need to rethink some of the things that we've been holding dear for a while. And we see very serious and sustained and data driven efforts to understand how to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have. So the green shoots are out there. I don't want to pretend for a minute that what we have is going to be enough. We're facing very tough challenges. To give just one example  there are about five million Americans who have been unemployed for at least six months. We're not going to fix things for them by sending them back to Montessori. And my biggest worry is that we're creating a world where we're going to have glittering technologies embedded in kind of a shabby society and supported by an economy that generates inequality instead of opportunity. But I actually don't think that's what we're going to do. I think we're going to do something a lot better for one very straightforward reason  The facts are getting out there. The realities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known. If we wanted to accelerate that process  we could do things like have our best economists and policymakers play  Jeopardy   against Watson. We could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip. And if we do enough of these kinds of things  the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different. And then we're off to the races  because I don't believe for a second that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too apathetic or hard hearted to even try. I started my talk with quotes from wordsmiths who were separated by an ocean and a century. Let me end it with words from politicians who were similarly distant. Winston Churchill came to my home of MIT in       and he said   If we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance  it can only be by the tireless improvement of all of our means of technical production.  Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient. He said   I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth  they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to give them the plain facts.  So the optimistic note  great point that I want to leave you with is that the plain facts of the machine age are becoming clear  and I have every confidence that we're going to use them to chart a good course into the challenging  abundant economy that we're creating. Thank you very much. So what does it mean for a machine to be athletic  We will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism and the research to achieve it with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters  or quads  for short. Quads have been around for a long time. They're so popular these days because they're mechanically simple. By controlling the speeds of these four propellers  these machines can roll  pitch  yaw  and accelerate along their common orientation. On board are also a battery  a computer  various sensors and wireless radios. Quads are extremely agile  but this agility comes at a cost. They are inherently unstable  and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly. So  how did it just do that  Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system. It's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them. This data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms  which in turn sends commands to the quad  which is also running estimation and control algorithms. The bulk of our research is algorithms. It's the magic that brings these machines to life. So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete  We use something broadly called model based design. We first capture the physics with a mathematical model of how the machines behave. We then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them. For example  that's how we can make the quad hover. We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations. We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad. Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach. Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole. With a little bit of practice  it's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this  although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands. It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I don't use my hands. Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top  which means that it can be located in the space. You can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced. How did we design the algorithms to do this  We added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad. Once we have a model of the combined quad pole system  we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it. Here  you see that it's stable  and even if I give it little nudges  it goes back    to the nice  balanced position. We can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space. Using this pointer  made out of reflective markers  I can point to where I want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me. The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms  designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory. Let's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop  and I will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world. Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it. Unlike the balancing pole  I did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system. In fact  the system doesn't even know that the glass is there. Like before  I could use the pointer to tell the quad where I want it to be in space. Okay  you should be asking yourself  why doesn't the water fall out of the glass  Two facts. The first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way. The second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass  pointing up. You put these two things together  the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects  which at these speeds are negligible. And that's why you don't need to model the glass. It naturally doesn't spill  no matter what the quad does. The lesson here is that some high performance tasks are easier than others  and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard. In this instance  carrying a glass of water is easy. Balancing a pole is hard. We've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured. Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage  Conventional wisdom says that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly  because there are four degrees of freedom to control  roll  pitch  yaw and acceleration. Hexacopters and octocopters  with six and eight propellers  can provide redundancy  but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs  four. Or do they  If we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working propellers  we discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it. We relinquish control of yaw  but roll  pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration. Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible. In this instance  this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage  just like human athletes do  instead of building machines with redundancy. We can't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water  or when a vaulter is twisting in the air  the ground fast approaching. Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry  Will the vaulter stick the landing  Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started. This maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution. There simply isn't enough time. Instead  what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly  observe how it finishes the maneuver  and then use that information to modify its behavior so that the next flip is better. Similar to the diver and the vaulter  it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard. Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports. How do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort  This quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple  so not too large. The following calculations are made every    milliseconds  or    times per second. We first figure out where the ball is going. We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from. Third  a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball. Fourth  we only execute    milliseconds' worth of that strategy. Twenty milliseconds later  the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball. Machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own  they can do it collectively. These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net. They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me. Notice that  at full extension  these quads are vertical. In fact  when fully extended  this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch. The algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me. Mathematical models are used to continuously re plan a cooperative strategy    times per second. Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities. What happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being  What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming. It can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time. Similar to the pointer that I used earlier  we can use this as inputs to the system. We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures. Interaction doesn't have to be virtual. It can be physical. Take this quad  for example. It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space. If I try to move it out of the way  it fights me  and moves back to where it wants to be. We can change this behavior  however. We can use mathematical models to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad. Once we know this force  we can also change the laws of physics  as far as the quad is concerned  of course. Here  the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid. We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine. I will use this new capability to position this camera carrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this demonstration. So we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics. Let's have a little bit of fun with this. For what you will see next  these quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto. As time goes on  gravity will be increased until we're all back on planet Earth  but I assure you we won't get there. Okay  here goes. Whew  You're all thinking now  these guys are having way too much fun  and you're probably also asking yourself  why exactly are they building machine athletes  Some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities. Others think that it has more of a social role  that it's used to bind the group. Similarly  we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits. What impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life  Like all our past creations and innovations  they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused. This is not a technical choice we are faced with  it's a social one. Let's make the right choice  the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines  just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us. Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain. They're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team. Federico Augugliaro  Dario Brescianini  Markus Hehn  Sergei Lupashin  Mark Muller and Robin Ritz. Look out for them. They're destined for great things. Thank you. This will not be a speech like any one I have ever given. I will talk to you today about the failure of leadership in global politics and in our globalizing economy. And I won't provide some feel good  ready made solutions. But I will in the end urge you to rethink  actually take risks  and get involved in what I see as a global evolution of democracy. Failure of leadership. What is the failure of leadership today  And why is our democracy not working  Well  I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken you out of the process. So let me  from my personal experiences  give you an insight  so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going down a blind alley. Let's start from the beginning. Let's start from democracy. Well  if you go back to the Ancient Greeks  it was a revelation  a discovery  that we had the potential  together  to be masters of our own fate  to be able to examine  to learn  to imagine  and then to design a better life. And democracy was the political innovation which protected this freedom  because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact  whether they be despots or dogmas  could be the protagonists. Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power  whether it was of tyrants or of high priests  their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth. Well  I first began to understand this when I was    years old. I used to  to try to avoid homework  sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly. You see  then Greece was under control of a very powerful establishment which was strangling the country  and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine Greece  to imagine a Greece where freedom reigned and where  maybe  the people  the citizens  could actually rule their own country. I used to join him in many of the campaigns  and you can see me here next to him. I'm the younger one there  to the side. You may not recognize me because I used to part my hair differently there. So in       elections were coming  things were going well in the campaign  the house was electric. We really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in Greece. Then one night  military trucks drive up to our house. Soldiers storm the door. They find me up on the top terrace. A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun  puts it to my head  and says   Tell me where your father is or I will kill you.  My father  hiding nearby  reveals himself  and was summarily taken to prison. Well  we survived  but democracy did not. Seven brutal years of dictatorship which we spent in exile. Now  today  our democracies are again facing a moment of truth. Let me tell you a story. Sunday evening  Brussels  April     . I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union. I had just been elected prime minister  but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth that our deficit was not   percent  as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections by the previous government  but actually   .  percent. But the deficit was only the symptom of much deeper problems that Greece was facing  and I had been elected on a mandate  a mission  actually  to tackle these problems  whether it was lack of transparency and accountability in governance  or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to the powerful    tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system  politics and media captured by special interests. But despite our electoral mandate  the markets mistrusted us. Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing  and we were facing possible default. So I went to Brussels on a mission to make the case for a united European response  one that would calm the markets and give us the time to make the necessary reforms. But time we didn't get. Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels. Negotiations are difficult  the tensions are high  progress is slow  and then     minutes to    a prime minister shouts out   We have to finish in    minutes.  I said   Why  These are important decisions. Let's deliberate a little bit longer.  Another prime minister comes in and says   No  we have to have an agreement now  because in    minutes  the markets are opening up in Japan  and there will be havoc in the global economy.  We quickly came to a decision in those    minutes. This time it was not the military  but the markets  that put a gun to our collective heads. What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life  painful to me  painful to my countrymen  imposing cuts  austerity  often on those not to blame for the crisis. With these sacrifices  Greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided a collapse. Greece  yes  triggered the Euro crisis  and some people blame me for pulling the trigger. But I think today that most would agree that Greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone  vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system  vulnerabilities of our democracies. Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail  or  more accurately  too big to control. Our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws  evade taxes  evade environmental or labor standards. Our democracies are undermined by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth  lobbies  corruption  the speed of the markets or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster  have constrained our democracies  and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential  your potential  in finding solutions. Greece  you see  was only a preview of what is in store for us all. I  overly optimistically  had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece  for Europe  for the world  to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions. Instead  I had a very humbling experience. In Brussels  when we tried desperately again and again to find common solutions  I realized that not one  not one of us  had ever dealt with a similar crisis. But worse  we were trapped by our collective ignorance. We were led by our fears. And our fears led to a blind faith in the orthodoxy of austerity. Instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies  investing in it to find more creative solutions  we reverted to political posturing. And then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis  and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective European failure  and of course that was Greece. Those profligate  idle  ouzo swilling  Zorba dancing Greeks  they are the problem. Punish them  Well  a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself. But let me warn you  this is not just about Greece. This could be the pattern that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex  cross border problems  whether it's climate change  whether it's migration  whether it's the financial system. That is  abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential  falling victims to our fears  our stereotypes  our dogmas  taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around our citizens. And doing so will only test the faith of our citizens  of our peoples  even more in the democratic process. It's no wonder that many political leaders  and I don't exclude myself  have lost the trust of our people. When riot police have to protect parliaments  a scene which is increasingly common around the world  then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies. That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people own and decide on the terms of the rescue package. My European counterparts  some of them  at least  said   You can't do this. There will be havoc in the markets again.  I said   We need to  before we restore confidence in the markets  we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people.  Since leaving office  I have had time to reflect. We have weathered the storm  in Greece and in Europe  but we remain challenged. If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential  well then    percent youth unemployment in Greece  and in other countries  certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion. So far  we've thrown economics at the problem  actually mostly austerity  and certainly we could have designed alternatives  a different strategy  a green stimulus for green jobs  or mutualized debt  Eurobonds which would support countries in need from market pressures  these would have been much more viable alternatives. Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one of democracy. So let's try something else. Let's see how we can bring people back to the process. Let's throw democracy at the problem. Again  the Ancient Greeks  with all their shortcomings  believed in the wisdom of the crowd at their best moments. In people we trust. Democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating  debating  taking on public responsibilities for public affairs. Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to decide on critical matters of the day. Science  theater  research  philosophy  games of the mind and the body  they were daily exercises. Actually they were an education for participation  for the potential  for growing the potential of our citizens. And those who shunned politics  well  they were idiots. You see  in Ancient Greece  in ancient Athens  that term originated there.  Idiot  comes from the root  idio   oneself. A person who is self centered  secluded  excluded  someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs. And participation took place in the agora  the agora having two meanings  both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation. You see  markets and politics then were one  unified  accessible  transparent  because they gave power to the people. They serve the demos  democracy. Above government  above markets was the direct rule of the people. Today we have globalized the markets but we have not globalized our democratic institutions. So our politicians are limited to local politics  while our citizens  even though they see a great potential  are prey to forces beyond their control. So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora  How do we democratize globalization  And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the United Nations or the G  . I'm talking about  how do we secure the space  the demos  the platform of values  so that we can tap into all of your potential  Well  this is exactly where I think Europe fits in. Europe  despite its recent failures  is the world's most successful cross border peace experiment. So let's see if it can't be an experiment in global democracy  a new kind of democracy. Let's see if we can't design a European agora  not simply for products and services  but for our citizens  where they can work together  deliberate  learn from each other  exchange between art and cultures  where they can come up with creative solutions. Let's imagine that European citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a European president  or citizen juries chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues  a European wide referendum where our citizens  as the lawmakers  vote on future treaties. And here's an idea  Why not have the first truly European citizens by giving our immigrants  not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship  but a European citizenship  And make sure we actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe. Where our common identity is democracy  where our education is through participation  and where participation builds trust and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia. Europe of and by the people  a Europe  an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders. Now  some might accuse me of being naive  putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people. Well  after decades in politics  I am also a pragmatist. Believe me  I have been  I am  part of today's political system  and I know things must change. We must revive politics as the power to imagine  reimagine  and redesign for a better world. But I also know that this disruptive force of change won't be driven by the politics of today. The revival of democratic politics will come from you  and I mean all of you. Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas  whether it's here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally  where everybody lives  everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality  everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy  dogma rather than critical thinking  technocracy rather than democracy  everyone who stands up to the unchecked power  whether it's authoritarian leaders  plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens  or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few. It is in their interest that all of us are idiots. Let's not be. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  You seem to describe a political leadership that is kind of unprepared and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets  and that scene in Brussels that you describe  to me  as a citizen  is terrifying. Help us understand how you felt after the decision. It was not a good decision  clearly  but how do you feel after that  not as the prime minister  but as George  George Papandreou  Well  obviously there were constraints which didn't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted  and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem. And that hurt. That hurt because that  first of all  hurt the younger generation  and not only  many of them are demonstrating outside  but I think this is one of our problems. When we face these crises  we have kept the potential  the huge potential of our society out of this process  and we are closing in on ourselves in politics  and I think we need to change that  to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology  the minds that we have  and I think we can find solutions which are much better  but we have to be open. BG  You seem to suggest that the way forward is more Europe  and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most European countries. It's rather the other way    more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the European construction. How do you reconcile that  GP  Well  I think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game. And the fundamental idea of Europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders  go beyond our conflicts and work together. And the paradox is that  because we have this blame game  we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together  while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together. Now  more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels. It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe  that is  really making Europe a project of the people. So that  I think  would be a way to answer some of the fears that we have in our society. BG  George  thank you for coming to TED. GP  Thank you very much.BG  Thank you. Applause  I write fiction sci fi thrillers  so if I say  killer robots   you'd probably think something like this. But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction. I'm here to talk about very real killer robots  autonomous combat drones. Now  I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones  which have a human making targeting decisions. I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons that make lethal decisions about human beings all on their own. There's actually a technical term for this  lethal autonomy. Now  lethally autonomous killer robots would take many forms    flying  driving  or just lying in wait. And actually  they're very quickly becoming a reality. These are two automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea. Both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target and firing on it  the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer. Now  in both cases  there's still a human in the loop to make that lethal firing decision  but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice. And it's that choice that I want to focus on  because as we migrate lethal decision making from humans to software  we risk not only taking the humanity out of war  but also changing our social landscape entirely  far from the battlefield. That's because the way humans resolve conflict shapes our social landscape. And this has always been the case  throughout history. For example  these were state of the art weapons systems in      A.D. Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain  but with these you could dominate the populace  and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that. Power was focused at the very top. And what changed  Technological innovation. Gunpowder  cannon. And pretty soon  armor and castles were obsolete  and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield versus how many people you brought to the battlefield. And as armies grew in size  the nation state arose as a political and logistical requirement of defense. And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace  they began to share power. Representative government began to form. So again  the tools we use to resolve conflict shape our social landscape. Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool  except that  by requiring very few people to go to war  they risk re centralizing power into very few hands  possibly reversing a five century trend toward democracy. Now  I think  knowing this  we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions  to do what humans do best  which is adapt. But time is a factor. Seventy nations are developing remotely piloted combat drones of their own  and as you'll see  remotely piloted combat drones are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons. That's because once you've deployed remotely piloted drones  there are three powerful factors pushing decision making away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself. The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce. For example  in       the U.S. drone fleet produced a grand total of    hours of video surveillance for analysis. By       this had gone up to         hours  outstripping human ability to review it all  but even that number is about to go up drastically. The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs will put up to    independently operated camera eyes on each drone platform  and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it. And that means visual intelligence software will need to scan it for items of interest. And that means very soon drones will tell humans what to look at  not the other way around. But there's a second powerful incentive pushing decision making away from humans and onto machines  and that's electromagnetic jamming  severing the connection between the drone and its operator. Now we saw an example of this in      when an American RQ     Sentinel drone got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack  but any remotely piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack  and that means drones will have to shoulder more decision making. They'll know their mission objective  and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance. They'll ignore external radio signals and send very few of their own. Which brings us to  really  the third and most powerful incentive pushing decision making away from humans and onto weapons  plausible deniability. Now we live in a global economy. High tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents. Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs to parts unknown  and in that environment  it is very likely that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories  proliferate in the gray market. And in that situation  sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack  it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon. This raises the very real possibility of anonymous war. This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head  make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower against an attacker  and that could shift the balance in the   st century away from defense and toward offense. It could make military action a viable option not just for small nations  but criminal organizations  private enterprise  even powerful individuals. It could create a landscape of rival warlords undermining rule of law and civil society. Now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government  autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both. Now you might be thinking that citizens of high tech nations would have the advantage in any robotic war  that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable  particularly against developing nations. But I think the truth is the exact opposite. I think citizens of high tech societies are more vulnerable to robotic weapons  and the reason can be summed up in one word  data. Data powers high tech societies. Cell phone geolocation  telecom metadata  social media  email  text  financial transaction data  transportation data  it's a wealth of real time data on the movements and social interactions of people. In short  we are more visible to machines than any people in history  and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons. What you're looking at here is a link analysis map of a social group. Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals. And these types of maps can be automatically generated based on the data trail modern people leave behind. Now it's typically used to market goods and services to targeted demographics  but it's a dual use technology  because targeting is used in another context. Notice that certain individuals are highlighted. These are the hubs of social networks. These are organizers  opinion makers  leaders  and these people also can be automatically identified from their communication patterns. Now  if you're a marketer  you might then target them with product samples  try to spread your brand through their social group. But if you're a repressive government searching for political enemies  you might instead remove them  eliminate them  disrupt their social group  and those who remain behind lose social cohesion and organization. Now in a world of cheap  proliferating robotic weapons  borders would offer very little protection to critics of distant governments or trans national criminal organizations. Popular movements agitating for change could be detected early and their leaders eliminated before their ideas achieve critical mass. And ideas achieving critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about. Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests. And this would put a chill on free speech and popular political action  the very heart of democracy. And this is why we need an international treaty on robotic weapons  and in particular a global ban on the development and deployment of killer robots. Now we already have international treaties on nuclear and biological weapons  and  while imperfect  these have largely worked. But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous  because they will almost certainly be used  and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions. Now in November      the U.S. Department of Defense issued a directive requiring a human being be present in all lethal decisions. This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military  but that directive needs to be made permanent. And it could set the stage for global action. Because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons. And we need it now  before there's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences. Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands  and they would imperil democracy itself. Now  don't get me wrong  I think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones  environmental monitoring  search and rescue  logistics. If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons  how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons  I think the secret will be transparency. No robot should have an expectation of privacy in a public place. Each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces. We have license plates on cars  tail numbers on aircraft. This is no different. And every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them  both right now and historically. And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones  and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down  they should notify humans to their presence. And in certain very high security areas  perhaps civic drones would snare them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility. But notice  this is more an immune system than a weapons system. It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our open  civil society. We must ban the deployment and development of killer robots. Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war. Autocratic governments and criminal organizations undoubtedly will  but let's not join them. Autonomous robotic weapons would concentrate too much power in too few unseen hands  and that would be corrosive to representative government. Let's make sure  for democracies at least  killer robots remain fiction. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone. You know that all over the world  people fight for their freedom  fight for their rights. Some battle oppressive governments. Others battle oppressive societies. Which battle do you think is harder  Allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes. Let me take you back two years ago in my life. It was the bedtime of my son  Aboody. He was five at the time. After finishing his bedtime rituals  he looked at me and he asked a question   Mommy  are we bad people   I was shocked.  Why do you say such things  Aboody   Earlier that day  I noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school. He wouldn't tell me what happened.  But now  he was ready to tell.  Two boys hit me today in school. They told me  'We saw your mom on Facebook. You and your mom should be put in jail.'  I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything. I've been always a proud woman of my achievements. But those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth  when it all came together. You see  I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars. Just for giving me his car keys  my own brother was detained twice  and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist  leave the country with his wife and two year old son. My father had to sit in a Friday sermon listening to the imam condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes amongst tons of worshippers  some of them our friends and family of my own father. I was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings  in the streets and in schools. It all hit me. It came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son. They were just influenced by the adults around them. And it wasn't about me  and it wasn't a punishment for taking the wheel and driving a few miles. It was a punishment for daring to challenge the society's rules. But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine. Allow me to give you a briefing about my story. It was May        and I was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments I had to face trying to find a ride back home  although I have a car and an international driver's license. As long as I've known  women in Saudi Arabia have been always complaining about the ban  but it's been    years since anyone tried to do anything about it  a whole generation ago. He broke the good bad news in my face.  But there is no law banning you from driving.  I looked it up  and he was right. There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia. It was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women. That realization ignited the idea of June     where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive. It was a few weeks later  we started receiving all these  Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive.  A courageous woman  her name is Najla Hariri  she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah  she drove a car and she announced but she didn't record a video. We needed proof. So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube. And to my surprise  it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day. What happened next  of course  I started receiving threats to be killed  raped  just to stop this campaign. The Saudi authorities remained very quiet. That really creeped us out. I was in the campaign with other Saudi women and even men activists. We wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day  June     when women go out and drive. So this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car. It went fast. We were arrested  signed a pledge not to drive again  released. Arrested again  he was sent to detention for one day  and I was sent to jail. I wasn't sure why I was sent there  because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation. But what I was sure of was my innocence. I didn't break a law  and I kept my abaya   it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house   and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off  but I was so sure of my innocence  I kept saying   No  I'm leaving today.  Outside the jail  the whole country went into a frenzy  some attacking me badly  and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me. I was released after nine days. June    comes. The streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars  but some hundred brave Saudi women broke the ban and drove that day. None were arrested. We broke the taboo. So I think by now  everyone knows that we can't drive  or women are not allowed to drive  in Saudi Arabia  but maybe few know why. Allow me to help you answer this question. There was this official study that was presented to the Shura Council    it's the consultative council appointed by the king in Saudi Arabia   and it was done by a local professor  a university professor. He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study. And the study states  the percentage of rape  adultery  illegitimate children  even drug abuse  prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don't drive. I know  I was like this  I was shocked. I was like   We are the last country in the world where women don't drive.  So if you look at the map of the world  that only leaves two countries  Saudi Arabia  and the other society is the rest of the world. We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study  and it made headlines around the world.  BBC News  'End of virginity' if women drive  Saudi cleric warns  And only then we realized it's so empowering to mock your oppressor. It strips it away of its strongest weapon  fear. This system is based on ultra conservative traditions and customs that deal with women as if they are inferior and they need a guardian to protect them  so they need to take permission from this guardian  whether verbal or written  all their lives. We are minors until the day we die. And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law  or the religious laws. What's worst  when they become codified as laws in the system  and when women themselves believe in their inferiority  and they even fight those who try to question these rules. So for me  it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face. It was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality  of my person    the villain back in my home country  and the hero outside. Just to tell you  two stories happened in the last two years. One of them is when I was in jail. I'm pretty sure when I was in jail  everyone saw titles in the international media something like this during these nine days I was in jail. But in my home country  it was a totally different picture. It was more like this   Manal al Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive.  I know.  Manal al Sharif withdraws from the campaign.  Ah  it's okay. This is my favorite.  Manal al Sharif breaks down and confesses  'Foreign forces incited me.'  And it goes on  even trial and flogging me in public. So it's a totally different picture. I was asked last year to give a speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum. I was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me  and they looked at me as an inspiration. At the same time  I flew back to my home country  they hated that speech so much. The way they called it  a betrayal to the Saudi country and the Saudi people  and they even started a hashtag called  OsloTraitor on Twitter. Some        tweets were written in that hashtag  while the opposite hashtag   OsloHero  there was like a handful of tweets written. They even started a poll. More than        voters answered this poll  whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech. Ninety percent said yes  she's a traitor. So it's these two totally different perceptions of my personality. For me  I'm a proud Saudi woman  and I do love my country  and because I love my country  I'm doing this. Because I believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free. Thank you. Thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you. Thank you. But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you. I learned to be always there. The first thing  I got out of jail  of course after I took a shower  I went online  I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page  and I've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me. I would listen to what they say  and I would never defend myself with words only. I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign  I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license. There are a lot of people also    very big support  like those       people who signed the petition to release me. We sent a petition to the Shura Council in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women  and there were  like        citizens who believed in that and they signed that petition. There were people like that  I just showed some examples  who are amazing  who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia  and trying  and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views. Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women's rights. The Shura Council that's appointed by the king  by royal decree of King Abdullah  last year there were    women assigned to that Council  like    percent.    percent of the Council.  Applause  The same time  finally  that Council  after rejecting our petition four times for women driving  they finally accepted it last February. After being sent to jail or sentenced lashing  or sent to a trial  the spokesperson of the traffic police said  we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers. The Grand Mufti  who is the head of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia  he said  it's not recommended for women to drive. It used to be haram  forbidden  by the previous Grand Mufti. So for me  it's not about only these small steps. It's about women themselves. A friend once asked me  she said   So when do you think this women driving will happen   I told her   Only if women stop asking 'When ' and take action to make it now.  So it's not only about the system  it's also about us women to drive our own life  I'd say. So I have no clue  really  how I became an activist. And I don't know how I became one now. But all I know  and all I'm sure of  in the future when someone asks me my story  I will say   I'm proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban  fought the ban  and celebrated everyone's freedom.  So the question I started my talk with  who do you think is more difficult to face  oppressive governments or oppressive societies  I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech. Thank you  everyone. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Once upon a time we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity. This was called the Great Moderation  the misguided belief by most economists  policymakers and central banks that we have transformed into a new world of never ending growth and prosperity. This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth  by low and controlled inflation  by low unemployment  and controlled and low financial volatility. But the Great Recession in      and       the great crash  broke this illusion. A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector cascaded into five trillion dollars of losses in world GDP and almost     trillion losses in the global stock market. So the understanding of this Great Recession was that this was completely surprising  this came out of the blue  this was like the wrath of the gods. There was no responsibility. So  as a reflection of this  we started the Financial Crisis Observatory. We had the goal to diagnose in real time financial bubbles and identify in advance their critical time. What is the underpinning  scientifically  of this financial observatory  We developed a theory called  dragon kings.  Dragon kings represent extreme events which are of a class of their own. They are special. They are outliers. They are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable  perhaps controllable. Consider the financial price time series  a given stock  your perfect stock  or a global index. You have these up and downs. A very good measure of the risk of this financial market is the peaks to valleys that represent a worst case scenario when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom. You can look at the statistics  the frequency of the occurrence of peak to valleys of different sizes  which is represented in this graph. Now  interestingly     percent of the peak to valleys of different amplitudes can be represented by a universal power law represented by this red line here. More interestingly  there are outliers  there are exceptions which are above this red line  occur     times more frequently  at least  than the extrapolation would predict them to occur based on the calibration of the    percent remaining peak to valleys. They are due to trenchant dependancies such that a loss is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss. These kinds of dependencies are largely missed by standard risk management tools  which ignore them and see lizards when they should see dragon kings. The root mechanism of a dragon king is a slow maturation towards instability  which is the bubble  and the climax of the bubble is often the crash. This is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube reaching the boiling point  where the instability of the water occurs and you have the phase transition to vapor. And this process  which is absolutely non linear    cannot be predicted by standard techniques    is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior which is fundamentally endogenous. So the cause of the crash  the cause of the crisis has to be found in an inner instability of the system  and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur. Now  some of you may have come to the mind that is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently  Remember  black swan is this rare bird that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief that all swans should be white  so it has captured the idea of unpredictability  unknowability  that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable. Nothing can be further from the dragon king concept I propose  which is exactly the opposite  that most extreme events are actually knowable and predictable. So we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them. So let's have my dragon king burn this black swan concept. There are many early warning signals that are predicted by this theory. Let me just focus on one of them  the super exponential growth with positive feedback. What does it mean  Imagine you have an investment that returns the first year five percent  the second year    percent  the third year    percent  the next year    percent. Is that not marvelous  This is a super exponential growth. A standard exponential growth corresponds to a constant growth rate  let's say  of    percent The point is that  many times during bubbles  there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times  such that previous growths enhance  push forward  increase the next growth through this kind of super exponential growth  which is very trenchant  not sustainable. And the key idea is that the mathematical solution of this class of models exhibit finite time singularities  which means that there is a critical time where the system will break  will change regime. It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau  something else. And the key idea is that the critical time  the information about the critical time is contained in the early development of this super exponential growth. We have applied this theory early on  that was our first success  to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements on the iron rocket. Using acoustic emission  you know  this little noise that you hear a structure emit  sing to you when they are stressed  and reveal the damage going on  there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback  the more damage gives the more damage  so you can actually predict  within  of course  a probability band  when the rupture will occur. So this is now so successful that it is used in the initial phase of  unclear  the flight. Perhaps more surprisingly  the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine  parturition  the act of giving birth  epileptic seizures. From seven months of pregnancy  a mother starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus that are the sign of these maturations toward the instability  giving birth to the baby  the dragon king. So if you measure the precursor signal  you can actually identify pre  and post maturity problems in advance. Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size  and when the brain goes to a super critical state  you have dragon kings which have a degree of predictability and this can help the patient to deal with this illness. We have applied this theory to many systems  landslides  glacier collapse  even to the dynamics of prediction of success  blockbusters  YouTube videos  movies  and so on. But perhaps the most important application is for finance  and this theory illuminates  I believe  the deep reason for the financial crisis that we have gone through. This is rooted in    years of history of bubbles  starting in       with the global bubble crashing in       followed by many other bubbles. The biggest one was the  new economy  Internet bubble in       crashing in       the real estate bubbles in many countries  financial derivative bubbles everywhere  stock market bubbles also everywhere  commodity and all bubbles  debt and credit bubbles    bubbles  bubbles  bubbles. We had a global bubble. This is a measure of global overvaluation of all markets  expressing what I call an illusion of a perpetual money machine that suddenly broke in     . The problem is that we see the same process  in particular through quantitative easing  of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays to tackle the crisis since      in the U.S.  in Europe  in Japan. This has very important implications to understand the failure of quantitative easing as well as austerity measures as long as we don't attack the core  the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking. Now  these are big claims. Why would you believe me  Well  perhaps because  in the last    years we have come out of our ivory tower  and started to publish ex ante    and I stress the term ex ante  it means  in advance    before the crash confirmed the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses. These are a few of the major bubbles that we have lived through in recent history. Again  many interesting stories for each of them. Let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles. We all know the Chinese miracle. This is the expression of the stock market of a massive bubble  a factor of three      percent in just a few years. In September       I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund management conference  and I showed to the conference a prediction that by the end of       this bubble would change regime. There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable. Now  how do you believe the very smart  very motivated  very informed macro hedge fund managers reacted to this prediction  You know  they had made billions just surfing this bubble until now. They told me   Didier  yeah  the market might be overvalued  but you forget something. There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming in August       and it's very clear that the Chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market.  Three weeks after my presentation  the markets lost    percent and went through a phase of volatility  upheaval  and a total market loss of    percent until the end of the year. So how can we be so collectively wrong by misreading or ignoring the science of the fact that when an instability has developed  and the system is ripe  any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control  The Chinese market collapsed  but it rebounded. In       we also identified that this new bubble  a smaller one  was unsustainable  so we published again a prediction  in advance  stating that by August       the market will correct  will not continue on this track. Our critics  reading the prediction  said   No  it's not possible. The Chinese government is there. They have learned their lesson. They will control. They want to benefit from the growth.  Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously. So the crisis did occur. The market corrected. The same critics then said   Ah  yes  but you published your prediction. You influenced the market. It was not a prediction.  Maybe I am very powerful then. Now  this is interesting. It shows that it's essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics because we are sentient beings who anticipate and there is a problem of self fulfilling prophesies. So we invented a new way of doing science. We created the Financial Bubble Experiment. The idea is the following. We monitor the markets. We identify excesses  bubbles. We do our work. We write a report in which we put our prediction of the critical time. We don't release the report. It's kept secret. But with modern encrypting techniques  we have a hash  we publish a public key  and six months later  we release the report  and there is authentication. And all this is done on an international archive so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes. Let me tease you with a very recent analysis.   th of May        just two weeks ago  we identified that the U.S. stock market was on an unsustainable path and we released this on our website on the   st of May that there will be a change of regime. The next day  the market started to change regime  course. This is not a crash. This is just the third or fourth act of a massive bubble in the making. Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet  we see the same thing. Wherever we look  it's observable  in the biosphere  in the atmosphere  in the ocean  showing these super exponential trajectories characterizing an unsustainable path and announcing a phase transition. This diagram on the right shows a very beautiful compilation of studies suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear    possibility for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades. So there are bubbles everywhere. From one side  this is exciting for me  as a professor who chases bubbles and slays dragons  as the media has sometimes called me. But can we really slay the dragons  Very recently  with collaborators  we studied a dynamical system where you see the dragon king as these big loops and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times that removed  when control is on  these dragons.  Gouverner  c'est pr voir.  Governing is the art of planning and predicting. But is it not the case that this is probably one of the biggest gaps of mankind  which has the responsibility to steer our societies and our planet toward sustainability in the face of growing challenges and crises  But the dragon king theory gives hope. We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability. It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises so that we can be prepared  we can take measures  we can take responsibility  and so that never again will extremes and crises like the Great Recession or the European crisis take us by surprise. Thank you. Living in Africa is to be on the edge  metaphorically  and quite literally when you think about connectivity before     . Though many human intellectual and technological leaps had happened in Europe and the rest of the world  but Africa was sort of cut off. And that changed  first with ships when we had the Renaissance  the Scientific Revolution and also the Industrial Revolution. And now we've got the digital revolution. These revolutions have not been evenly distributed across continents and nations. Never have been. Now  this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables that connect Africa to the rest of the world. What I find amazing is that Africa is transcending its geography problem. Africa is connecting to the rest of the world and within itself. The connectivity situation has improved greatly  but some barriers remain. It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be. In       one of the problems that we faced was lack of information flow. There was a media blackout in       when there was post election violence in Kenya. It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time. So we came together and we created software called Ushahidi. And Ushahidi means  testimony  or  witness  in Swahili. I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators. This is David and Erik. I call them brothers from another mother. Clearly I have a German mother somewhere. And we worked together first with building and growing Ushahidi. And the idea of the software was to gather information from SMS  email and web  and put a map so that you could see what was happening where  and you could visualize that data. And after that initial prototype  we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did. All the while  we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days. And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi  an actual physical space where we could collaborate  and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya. We did that with the support of different organizations like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network. And we were able to grow this software footprint  and a few years later it became very useful software  and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti where citizens could indicate where they are and what their needs were  and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis and the tsunami in Japan. Now  this year the Internet turns     and Ushahidi turned five. Ushahidi is not only the software that we made. It is the team  and it's also the community that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee. We did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world. There are crisis maps  election maps  corruption maps  and even environmental monitoring crowd maps. We are humbled that this has roots in Kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with. There is more that we're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence  that I  as a citizen  if I share the information with whatever device that I have  could inform you about what is going on  and that if you do the same  we can have a bigger picture of what's going on. I moved back to Kenya in     . Erik moved in     . Very different reality. I used to live in Chicago where there was abundant Internet access. I had never had to deal with a blackout. And in Kenya  it's a very different reality  and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem. The day to day frustrations of dealing with this can be  let's just say very annoying. Blackouts are not fun. Imagine sitting down to start working  and all of a sudden the power goes out  your Internet connection goes down with it  so you have to figure out  okay  now  where's the modem  how do I switch back  And then  guess what  You have to deal with it again. Now  this is the reality of Kenya  where we live now  and other parts of Africa. The other problem that we're facing is that communication costs are also still a challenge. It costs me five Kenyan shillings  or .   USD to call the U.S.  Canada or China. Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda  Ghana  Nigeria  Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost to connect within Africa. And also  when traveling within Africa  you've got different settings for different mobile providers. This is the reality that we deal with. So we've got a joke in Ushahidi where we say   If it works in Africa  it'll work anywhere.   Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.  What if we could overcome the problem of unreliable Internet and electricity and reduce the cost of connection  Could we leverage the cloud  We've built a crowd map  we've built Ushahidi. Could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country  So we looked at the modem  an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet  and asked ourselves why the modems that we are using right now are built for a different context  where you've got ubiquitous internet  you've got ubiquitous electricity  yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury. We wanted to redesign the modem for the developing world  for our context  and for our reality. What if we could have connectivity with less friction  This is the BRCK. It acts as a backup to the Internet so that  when the power goes out  it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network. Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive. It's actually everywhere. Most towns at least have a  G connection. So why don't we leverage that  And that's why we built this. The other reason that we built this is when electricity goes down  this has eight hours of battery left  so you can continue working  you can continue being productive  and let's just say you are less stressed. And for rural areas  it can be the primary means of connection. The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play when we wondered how can we use the cloud to be more intelligent so that you can analyze the different networks  and whenever you switch on the backup  you pick on the fastest network  so we'll have multi SIM capability so that you can put multiple SIMs  and if one network is faster  that's the one you hop on  and if the up time on that is not very good  then you hop onto the next one. The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere. With load balancing  this can be possible. The other interesting thing for us    we like sensors    is this idea that you could have an on ramp for the Internet of things. Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this. It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have Internet connectivity even in very remote areas. Out of adversity can come innovation  and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers in Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure  And for us  we begin with solving the problem in our own backyard in Kenya. It is not without challenge. Our team has basically been mules carrying components from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations with customs border agents.  What are you carrying   And the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects. So we put it on Kickstarter  and I'm happy to say that  through the support of many people  not only here but online  the BRCK has been Kickstarted  and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins. I will close by saying that  if we solve this for the local market  it could be impactful not only for the coders in Nairobi but also for small business owners who need reliable connectivity  and it can reduce the cost of connecting  and hopefully collaboration within African countries. The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy are connectivity and entrepreneurship. The BRCK is our part to keep Africans connected  and to help them drive the global digital revolution. Thank you. I was born and raised in North Korea. Although my family constantly struggled against poverty  I was always loved and cared for first  because I was the only son and the youngest of two in the family. But then the great famine began in     . I was four years old. My sister and I would go searching for firewood starting at   in the morning and come back after midnight. I would wander the streets searching for food  and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother's back eating chips  and wanting to steal them from him. Hunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness. For a hungry child  politics and freedom are not even thought of. On my ninth birthday  my parents couldn't give me any food to eat. But even as a child  I could feel the heaviness in their hearts. Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time  and in       when I was    years old  my father became one of them. I saw my father wither away and die. In the same year  my mother disappeared one day  and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money  but that she would return with money and food soon. Since we had never been separated  and I thought we would be together forever  I didn't even give her a hug when she left. It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. But again  I didn't know it was going to be a long goodbye. I have not seen my mom or my sister since then. Suddenly  I became an orphan and homeless. My daily life became very hard  but very simple. My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash. But that is no way to survive. I started to realize  begging would not be the solution. So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets. Sometimes  I found small jobs in exchange for food. Once  I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine     meters underground without any protection for up to    hours a day. I was not uncommon. Many other orphans survived this way  or worse. When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains  I hoped that  the next morning  my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food. That hope kept me alive. I don't mean big  grand hope. I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread  even though it usually didn't. But if I didn't believe it  I wouldn't even try  and then I would die. Hope kept me alive. Every day  I told myself  no matter how hard things got  still I must live. After three years of waiting for my sister's return  I decided to go to China to look for her myself. I realized I couldn't survive much longer this way. I knew the journey would be risky  but I would be risking my life either way. I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea  or at least I could try for a better life by escaping to China. I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen. North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission. Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Koreans  where they face severe punishment. I decided to cross during the day  first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark  second because I knew I was already taking a risk  and since not many people tried to cross during the day  I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone. I made it to China on February         . I was    years old. I thought things in China would be easier  since there was more food. I thought more people would help me. But it was harder than living in North Korea  because I was not free. I was always worried about being caught and sent back. By a miracle  some months later  I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Koreans  and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years. Later that year  an activist helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee. I went to America without knowing a word of English  yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school. Even in North Korea  I was an F student. And I barely finished elementary school. And I remember I fought in school more than once a day. Textbooks and the library were not my playground. My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying  but it didn't work. At one point  my father gave up on me. He said   You're not my son anymore.  I was only    or     but it hurt me deeply. But nevertheless  my level of motivation still didn't change before he died. So in America  it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school. I didn't even go to middle school. I decided to go  just because they told me to  without trying much. But one day  I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner. And during dinner  I wanted to have one more wing  but I realized there were not enough for everyone  so I decided against it. When I looked down at my plate  I saw the last chicken wing  that my foster father had given me his. I was so happy. I looked at him sitting next to me. He just looked back at me very warmly  but said no words. Suddenly I remembered my biological father. My foster father's small act of love reminded me of my father  who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry  even if he was starving. I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America  yet my father died of starvation. My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him  and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him. And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice. I took school seriously  and for the first time ever in my life  I received an academic award for excellence  and made dean's list from the first semester in high school. That chicken wing changed my life. Hope is personal. Hope is something that no one can give to you. You have to choose to believe in hope. You have to make it yourself. In North Korea  I made it myself. Hope brought me to America. But in America  I didn't know what to do  because I had this overwhelming freedom. My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction  and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in America. I did not come here by myself. I had hope  but hope by itself is not enough. Many people helped me along the way to get here. North Koreans are fighting hard to survive. They have to force themselves to survive  have hope to survive  but they cannot make it without help. This is my message to you. Have hope for yourself  but also help each other. Life can be hard for everyone  wherever you live. My foster father didn't intend to change my life. In the same way  you may also change someone's life with even the smallest act of love. A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger  and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive. But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph's life and change thousands of other Josephs who are still having hope to survive. Thank you. Adrian Hong  Joseph  thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us. I know you haven't seen your sister for  you said  it was almost exactly a decade  and in the off chance that she may be able to see this  we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message. Joseph Kim  In Korean  AH  You can do English  then Korean as well. JK  Okay  I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean because I don't think I can make it without tearing up. Nuna  it has been already    years that I haven t seen you. I just wanted to say that I miss you  and I love you  and please come back to me and stay alive. And I    oh  gosh. I still haven't given up my hope to see you. I will live my life happily and study hard until I see you  and I promise I will not cry again. Yes  I'm just looking forward to seeing you  and if you can't find me  I will also look for you  and I hope to see you one day. And can I also make a small message to my mom  AH  Sure  please. JK  I haven't spent much time with you  but I know that you still love me  and you probably still pray for me and think about me. I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world. Thank you. The idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal. I don't think anyone in this room would disagree. What worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars    use the words    ... it all just sounds so  so simple.  Now  I've got no bucket of money today and I've got no policy to release  and I certainly haven't got a guitar. I'll leave that to others. But I do have an idea  and that idea is called Housing for Health. Housing for Health works with poor people. It works in the places where they live  and the work is done to improve their health. Over the last    years  this tough  grinding  dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around Australia and  more recently  overseas  and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments. It can improve health and it can play a part in reducing  if not eliminating  poverty. I'm going to start where the story began          in Central Australia. A man called Yami Lester  an Aboriginal man  was running a health service. Eighty percent of what walked in the door  in terms of illness  was infectious disease    third world  developing world infectious disease  caused by a poor living environment. Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs. He got a medical doctor. He got an environmental health guy. And he hand selected a team of local Aboriginal people to work on this project. Yami told us at that first meeting   There's no money      always a good start      ... no money  you have six months  and I want you to start on a project     which  in his language  he called  Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku   which  translated  is  a plan to stop people getting sick     a profound brief. That was our task. First step  the medical doctor went away for about six months. And he worked on what were to become these nine health goals    what were we aiming at  After six months of work  he came to my office and presented me with those nine words on a piece of paper.  The   Healthy Living Practices  Washing  clothes  wastewater  nutrition  crowding  animals  dust  temperature  injury  I was very unimpressed. Big ideas need big words  and preferably a lot of them. This didn't fit the bill. What I didn't see and what you can't see was that he'd assembled thousands of pages of local  national and international health research that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets. The pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason. The Aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people were most commonly illiterate  so the story had to be told in pictures of what these goals were. We worked with the community  not telling them what was going to happen in a language they didn't understand. So we had the goals and each one of these goals    and I won't go through them all    puts at the center the person and their health issue  and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their health good. And the highest priority  you see on the screen  is washing people once a day  particularly children. And I hope most of you are thinking   What  That sounds simple.  Now  I'm going to ask you all a very personal question. This morning before you came  who could have had a wash using a shower  I'm not going to ask if you had a shower  because I'm too polite. That's it. All right  I think it's fair to say most people here could have had a shower this morning. I'm going to ask you to do some more work. I want you all to select one of the houses of the    houses you see on the screen. I want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head. Have you all got a house  I'm going to ask you to live there for a few months  so make sure you've got it right. It's in the northwest of Western Australia  very pleasant place. OK. Let's see if your shower in that house is working. I hear some  Aw   and I hear some  Ah   If you get a green tick  your shower's working. You and your kids are fine. If you get a red cross  well  I've looked carefully around the room and it's not going to make much difference to this crew. Why  Because you're all too old. I know that's going to come as a shock to some of you  but you are. And before you get offended and leave  I've got to say that being too old  in this case  means that pretty much everyone in the room  I think  is over five years of age. We're really concerned with kids naught to five. And why  Washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs  the common infectious diseases of the eyes  the ears  the chest and the skin that  if they occur in the first five years of life  permanently damage those organs. They leave a lifelong remnant. That means that by the age of five  you can't see as well for the rest of your life. You can't hear as well for the rest of your life. You can't breathe as well. You've lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five. And even skin infection  which we originally thought wasn't that big a problem  mild skin infections naught to five give you a greatly increased chance of renal failure  needing dialysis at age   . This is a big deal  so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids. Those ticks and crosses represent the       houses we've looked at nationally around Australia  the same proportion. What you see on the screen       percent of those not so famous houses lived in by        indigenous people       percent had a working shower. Ten percent of those same       houses had safe electrical systems. And    percent of those houses had a working toilet. These are by a simple  standard test. In the case of the shower  does it have hot and cold water  two taps that work  a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body  and a drain that takes the water away  Not well designed  not beautiful  not elegant    just that they function. And the same tests for the electrical system and the toilets. Housing for Health projects aren't about measuring failure    they're actually about improving houses. We start on day one of every project. We've learned    we don't make promises  we don't do reports. We arrive in the morning with tools  tons of equipment  trades  and we train up a local team on the first day to start work. By the evening of the first day  a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning. That work continues for six to    months  until all the houses are improved and we've spent our budget of       dollars total per house. That's our average budget. At the end of six months to a year  we test every house again. It's very easy to spend money. It's very difficult to improve the function of all those parts of the house. And for a whole house  the nine healthy living practices  we test  check and fix     items in every house. And these are the results we can get with our       dollars. We can get showers up to    percent working  we can get electrical systems up to    percent working and we can get    percent of toilets working in those       houses. Thank you. The teams do a great job  and that's their work. I think there's an obvious question that I hope you're thinking about. Why do we have to do this work  Why are the houses in such poor condition  Seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance    the sort of things that happen in all our houses. Things wear out  should have been done by state government or local government  simply not done  the house doesn't work. Twenty one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction    literally things that are built upside down and back to front. They don't work  we have to fix them. And if you've lived in Australia in the last    years  the final cause    you will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses. It's one of the almost rock solid pieces of evidence which I've never seen evidence for  that's always reeled out as  That's the problem with indigenous housing.  Well  nine percent of what we spend is damage  misuse or abuse of any sort. We argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem. And we'll go a lot further than that  the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution. Seventy five percent of our national team in Australia    over    at the minute    are actually local  indigenous people from the communities we work in. They do all aspects of the work. In       for example  there were      all over Australia  and the Torres Strait Islands  all states  working to improve the houses where they and their families live  and that's an important thing. Our work's always had a focus on health. That's the key. The developing world bug  trachoma  causes blindness. It's a developing world illness  and yet  the picture you see behind is in an Aboriginal community in the late     s  where    percent of school aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes  doing damage. OK  what do we do  Well  first thing we do  we get showers working. Why  Because that flushes the bug out. We put washing facilities in the school as well  so kids can wash their faces many times during the day. We wash the bug out. Second  the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye and lets the bug in quick. So what do we do  We call up the doctor of dust  and there is such a person. He was loaned to us by a mining company. He controls dust on mining company sites. And he came out and  within a day  it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground  the wind driven dust    so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids. So we used dirt to stop dust. We did it. He provided us dust monitors. We tested and we reduced the dust. Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally. So how do we do that  Well  we call up the doctor of flies    and  yes  there is a doctor of flies. As our Aboriginal mate said   You white fellows ought to get out more.  And the doctor of flies very quickly determined that there was one fly that carried the bug. He could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide. They could trap the flies  send them to him in Perth. When the bug was in the gut  he'd send back by return post some dung beetles. The dung beetles ate the camel dung  the flies died through lack of food  and trachoma dropped. And over the year  trachoma dropped radically in this place  and stayed low. We changed the environment  not just treated the eyes. And finally  you get a good eye. All these small health gains and small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference. The New South Wales Department of Health  that radical organization  did an independent trial over three years to look at    years of the work we've been doing in these sorts of projects in New South Wales. And they found a    percent reduction in hospital admissions for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment    a    percent reduction. Just to show that the principles we've used in Australia can be used in other places  I'm just going to go to one other place  and that's Nepal. And what a beautiful place to go. We were asked by a small village of     people to go in and make toilets where none existed. Health was poor. We went in with no grand plan  no grand promises of a great program  just the offer to build two toilets for two families. It was during the design of the first toilet that I went for lunch  invited by the family into their main room of the house. It was choking with smoke. People were cooking on their only fuel source  green timber. The smoke coming off that timber is choking  and in an enclosed house  you simply can't breathe. Later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure. So all of a sudden  we had two problems. We were there originally to look at toilets and get human waste off the ground  that's fine. But all of a sudden now there was a second problem  How do we actually get the smoke down  So two problems  and design should be about more than one thing. Solution  Take human waste  take animal waste  put it into a chamber  out of that  extract biogas  methane gas. The gas gives three to four hours cooking a day    clean  smokeless and free for the family. I put it to you  is this eliminating poverty  And the answer from the Nepali team who's working at the minute would say  don't be ridiculous    we have three million more toilets to build before we can even make a stab at that claim. And I don't pretend anything else. But as we all sit here today  there are now over     toilets built in this village and a couple nearby. Well over       people use those toilets. Yami Lama  he's a young boy. He's got significantly less gut infection because he's now got toilets  and there isn't human waste on the ground. Kanji Maya  she's a mother  and a proud one. She's probably right now cooking lunch for her family on biogas  smokeless fuel. Her lungs have got better  and they'll get better as time increases  because she's not cooking in the same smoke. Surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber when it's shed the gas  he puts it on his crops. He's trebled his crop income  more food for the family and more money for the family. And finally Bishnu  the leader of the team  has now understood that not only have we built toilets  we've also built a team  and that team is now working in two villages where they're training up the next two villages to keep the work expanding. And that  to me  is the key. People are not the problem. We've never found that. The problem  poor living environment  poor housing and the bugs that do people harm. None of those are limited by geography  by skin color or by religion. None of them. The common link between all the work we've had to do is one thing  and that's poverty. Nelson Mandela said  in the mid     s  not too far from here  he said that like slavery and apartheid   Poverty is not natural. It is man made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.  I want to end by saying it's been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings doing    I think    extraordinary work  that have actually improved health  and  maybe only in a small way  reduced poverty. Thank you very much for your time. Everything is interconnected. As a Shinnecock Indian  I was raised to know this. We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York. When I was a little girl  my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day. There were no clouds in the sky. And after a while I began to perspire. And he pointed up to the sky  and he said   Look  do you see that  That's part of you up there. That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals.  In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life  I started storm chasing in      after my daughter said   Mom  you should do that.  And so three days later  driving very fast  I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell  capable of producing grapefruit size hail and spectacular tornadoes  although only two percent actually do. These clouds can grow so big  up to    miles wide and reach up to        feet into the atmosphere. They can grow so big  blocking all daylight  making it very dark and ominous standing under them. Storm chasing is a very tactile experience. There's a warm  moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth  the wheat  the grass  the charged particles. And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming  the greens and the turquoise blues. I've learned to respect the lightning. My hair used to be straight. I'm just kidding. What really excites me about these storms is their movement  the way they swirl and spin and undulate  with their lava lamp like mammatus clouds. They become lovely monsters. When I'm photographing them  I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson. As I stand under them  I see not just a cloud  but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces  the same process in a small scale version that helped to create our galaxy  our solar system  our sun and even this very planet. All my relations. Thank you. Writing biography is a strange thing to do. It's a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else's life  a journey  an exploration that can take you places you never dreamed of going and still can't quite believe you've been  especially if  like me  you're an agnostic Jew and the life you've been exploring is that of Muhammad. Five years ago  for instance  I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle to what I knew was an impossible question  What actually happened one desert night  half the world and almost half of history away  What happened  that is  on the night in the year     when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran on a mountain just outside Mecca  This is the core mystical moment of Islam  and as such  of course  it defies empirical analysis. Yet the question wouldn't let go of me. I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am  just asking it could be seen as pure chutzpah. And I plead guilty as charged  because all exploration  physical or intellectual  is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression  of crossing boundaries. Still  some boundaries are larger than others. So a human encountering the divine  as Muslims believe Muhammad did  to the rationalist  this is a matter not of fact but of wishful fiction  and like all of us  I like to think of myself as rational. Which might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts we have of that night  what struck me even more than what happened was what did not happen. Muhammad did not come floating off the mountain as though walking on air. He did not run down shouting   Hallelujah   and  Bless the Lord   He did not radiate light and joy. There were no choirs of angels  no music of the spheres  no elation  no ecstasy  no golden aura surrounding him  no sense of an absolute  fore ordained role as the messenger of God. That is  he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul  to put down the whole story as a pious fable. Quite the contrary. In his own reported words  he was convinced at first that what had happened couldn't have been real. At best  he thought  it had to have been a hallucination    a trick of the eye or the ear  perhaps  or his own mind working against him. At worst  possession    that he'd been seized by an evil jinn  a spirit out to deceive him  even to crush the life out of him. In fact  he was so sure that he could only be majnun  possessed by a jinn  that when he found himself still alive  his first impulse was to finish the job himself  to leap off the highest cliff and escape the terror of what he'd experienced by putting an end to all experience. So the man who fled down the mountain that night trembled not with joy but with a stark  primordial fear. He was overwhelmed not with conviction  but by doubt. And that panicked disorientation  that sundering of everything familiar  that daunting awareness of something beyond human comprehension  can only be called a terrible awe. This might be somewhat difficult to grasp now that we use the word  awesome  to describe a new app or a viral video. With the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake  we're protected from real awe. We close the doors and hunker down  convinced that we're in control  or  at least  hoping for control. We do our best to ignore the fact that we don't always have it  and that not everything can be explained. Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic  whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night came from inside himself or from outside  what's clear is that he did experience them  and that he did so with a force that would shatter his sense of himself and his world and transform this otherwise modest man into a radical advocate for social and economic justice. Fear was the only sane response  the only human response. Too human for some  like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that the account of his wanting to kill himself shouldn't even be mentioned  despite the fact that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies. They insist that he never doubted for even a single moment  let alone despaired. Demanding perfection  they refuse to tolerate human imperfection. Yet what  exactly  is imperfect about doubt  As I read those early accounts  I realized it was precisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me  that allowed me to begin to see him in full  to accord him the integrity of reality. And the more I thought about it  the more it made sense that he doubted  because doubt is essential to faith. If this seems a startling idea at first  consider that doubt  as Graham Greene once put it  is the heart of the matter. Abolish all doubt  and what's left is not faith  but absolute  heartless conviction. You're certain that you possess the Truth    inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T    and this certainty quickly devolves into dogmatism and righteousness  by which I mean a demonstrative  overweening pride in being so very right  in short  the arrogance of fundamentalism. It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists known as Crusaders   infidel   from the Latin for  faithless.  Doubly ironic  in this case  because their absolutism is in fact the opposite of faith. In effect  they are the infidels. Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes  they have no questions  only answers. They found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith. They don't have to struggle for it like Jacob wrestling through the night with the angel  or like Jesus in his    days and nights in the wilderness  or like Muhammad  not only that night on the mountain  but throughout his years as a prophet  with the Koran constantly urging him not to despair  and condemning those who most loudly proclaim that they know everything there is to know and that they and they alone are right. And yet we  the vast and still far too silent majority  have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority. We've allowed Judaism to be claimed by violently messianic West Bank settlers  Christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots  Islam by suicide bombers. And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be Christians  Jews or Muslims  militant extremists are none of the above. They're a cult all their own  blood brothers steeped in other people's blood. This isn't faith. It's fanaticism  and we have to stop confusing the two. We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers. It's difficult and stubborn. It involves an ongoing struggle  a continual questioning of what we think we know  a wrestling with issues and ideas. It goes hand in hand with doubt  in a never ending conversation with it  and sometimes in conscious defiance of it. And this conscious defiance is why I  as an agnostic  can still have faith. I have faith  for instance  that peace in the Middle East is possible despite the ever accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary. I'm not convinced of this. I can hardly say I believe it. I can only have faith in it  commit myself  that is  to the idea of it  and I do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence. Because despair is self fulfilling. If we call something impossible  we act in such a way that we make it so. And I  for one  refuse to live that way. In fact  most of us do  whether we're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond  for that matter  what drives us is that  despite our doubts and even because of our doubts  we reject the nihilism of despair. We insist on faith in the future and in each other. Call this naive if you like. Call it impossibly idealistic if you must. But one thing is sure  Call it human. Could Muhammad have so radically changed his world without such faith  without the refusal to cede to the arrogance of closed minded certainty  I think not. After keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years  I can't see that he'd be anything but utterly outraged at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today. He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population because of their gender. He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism. He'd call out terrorism for what it is  not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled for. He'd say what the Koran says  Anyone who takes a life takes the life of all humanity. Anyone who saves a life  saves the life of all humanity. And he'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process of making peace. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  I'll never forget that day back in the spring of     . I was a surgical resident at The Johns Hopkins Hospital  taking emergency call. I got paged by the E.R. around   in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot. I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her. And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital. That wasn't being asked. The question that was being asked of me was a different one  which was  did she also need an amputation  Now  looking back on that night  I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the    year old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer. In her case  I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life. The cancer was too advanced. But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee. I brought some for her parents. But more importantly  see  I passed no judgment on her  because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself. So why was it that  just a few nights later  as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation  why did I hold her in such bitter contempt  You see  unlike the woman the night before  this woman had type   diabetes. She was fat. And we all know that's from eating too much and not exercising enough  right  I mean  how hard can it be  As I looked down at her in the bed  I thought to myself  if you just tried caring even a little bit  you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot. Why did I feel justified in judging her  I'd like to say I don't know. But I actually do. You see  in the hubris of my youth  I thought I had her all figured out. She ate too much. She got unlucky. She got diabetes. Case closed. Ironically  at that time in my life  I was also doing cancer research  immune based therapies for melanoma  to be specific  and in that world I was actually taught to question everything  to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards. Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma  I never once questioned the conventional wisdom. I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science. Three years later  I found out how wrong I was. But this time  I was the patient. Despite exercising three or four hours every single day  and following the food pyramid to the letter  I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome. Some of you may have heard of this. I had become insulin resistant. You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat  whether we burn it or store it. This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo. Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life. And insulin resistance  as its name suggests  is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job. Once you're insulin resistant  you're on your way to getting diabetes  which is what happens when your pancreas can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin. Now your blood sugar levels start to rise  and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease  cancer  even Alzheimer's disease  and amputations  just like that woman a few years earlier. With that scare  I got busy changing my diet radically  adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking. I did this and lost    pounds  weirdly while exercising less. I  as you can see  I guess I'm not overweight anymore. More importantly  I don't have insulin resistance. But most important  I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away  How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right  If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me  was it possible it was failing someone else  And underlying these questions  I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance. Now  most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance. Logically  then  if you want to treat insulin resistance  you get people to lose weight  right  You treat the obesity. But what if we have it backwards  What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all  In fact  what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem  the tip of a proverbial iceberg  I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic  but hear me out. What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell  I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign  but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils. You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of our cells to partition fuel  as I alluded to a moment ago  taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately. When we become insulin resistant  the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state. So now  when insulin says to a cell  I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe  the cell  in effect  says   No thanks  I'd actually rather store this energy.  And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells  it's probably the safest place to store it. So for many of us  about    million Americans  the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat  not the reverse  getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat. This is a really subtle distinction  but the implication could be profound. Consider the following analogy  Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table. Sure  the bruise hurts like hell  and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look  but we all know the bruise per Se is not the problem. In fact  it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma  all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body. Now  imagine we thought bruises were the problem  and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises  masking creams  painkillers  you name it  all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables. How much better would we be if we treated the cause    telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room    rather than the effect  Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world. Getting it wrong  and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins. Cause and effect. So what I'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance. Maybe we should be asking ourselves  is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity  at least in most people  What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening  an underlying epidemic  the one we ought to be worried about  Let's look at some suggestive facts. We know that    million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance. And by the way  they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people. Conversely  we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin resistant  and by the way  they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts. Now I don't know why  but it might be because  in their case  their cells haven't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy. So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance  and you can be lean and have it  this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on. So what if we're fighting the wrong war  fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance  Even worse  what if blaming the obese means we're blaming the victims  What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong  Personally  I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore  let alone the luxury of certainty. I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this  but I'm wide open to others. Now  my hypothesis  because everybody always asks me  is this. If you ask yourself  what's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant  the answer probably isn't too much food. It's more likely too much glucose  blood sugar. Now  we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run  and there's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly. So if you put these physiological processes to work  I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains  sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes  but through insulin resistance  you see  and not necessarily through just overeating and under exercising. When I lost my    pounds a few years ago  I did it simply by restricting those things  which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience. But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong  and most important  all of this can be tested scientifically. But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity  diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested. I'm betting my career on this. Today  I devote all of my time to working on this problem  and I'll go wherever the science takes me. I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't. I've been humbled enough by all I don't know. For the past year  I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country  and the best part is  just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals  we've done the same thing. We've recruited a team of scientific rivals  the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic. Some think it's too many calories consumed. Others think it's too much dietary fat. Others think it's too many refined grains and starches. But this team of multi disciplinary  highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. First  this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. And two  if we're willing to be wrong  if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer  we can solve this problem. I know it's tempting to want an answer right now  some form of action or policy  some dietary prescription    eat this  not that   but if we want to get it right  we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription. Briefly  to address this  our research program is focused around three meta themes  or questions. First  how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism  hormones and enzymes  and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms  Second  based on these insights  can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that's safe and practical to implement  And finally  once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet  how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception  Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it. Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier  and believe it or not  that can be studied scientifically. I don't know how this journey is going to end  but this much seems clear to me  at least  We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did. Most of them actually want to do the right thing  but they have to know what that is  and it's got to work. I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance  because as medical professionals  we've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals  open minds  the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas when they don't appear to be working  and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final  but constantly evolving. Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science. If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness  what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy  Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R. seven years ago. I wish I could speak with that woman again. I'd like to tell her how sorry I am. I'd say  as a doctor  I delivered the best clinical care I could  but as a human being  I let you down. You didn't need my judgment and my contempt. You needed my empathy and compassion  and above all else  you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn't let the system down. Maybe the system  of which I was a part  was letting you down. If you're watching this now  I hope you can forgive me. I'm going to be talking about designing humor  which is sort of an interesting thing  but it goes to some of the discussions about constraints  and how in certain contexts  humor is right  and in other contexts it's wrong. Now  I'm from New York  so it's     percent satisfaction here. Actually  that's ridiculous  because when it comes to humor     percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for. Nobody is ever satisfied     percent with humor except this woman. Bob Mankoff  That's my first wife. That part of the relationship went fine. Now let's look at this cartoon. One of the things I'm pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of The New Yorker magazine  that lovely Caslon type  and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context. It's making a little bit fun of getting older  and  you know  people might like it. But like I said  you cannot satisfy everyone. You couldn't satisfy this guy.  Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit. It's nice  I'm sure to be young and rude  but some day you'll be old  unless you drop dead as I wish.  The New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment  very easy for people to get their nose out of joint. And one of the things that you realize is it's an unusual environment. Here I'm one person talking to you. You're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh. In The New Yorker  it goes out to a wide audience  and when you actually look at that  and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at  and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting. Let's look at this cartoon.  Discouraging data on the antidepressant.  Indeed  it is discouraging. Now  you would think  well  look  most of you laughed at that. Right  You thought it was funny. In general  that seems like a funny cartoon  but let's look what online survey I did. Generally  about    percent of the people liked it. A hundred and nine voted it a     the highest. Ten voted it one. But look at the individual responses.  I like animals       Look how much they like them.  I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me.  This person rated it a two.  I don't like to see animals suffer    even in cartoons.  To people like this  I point out we use anesthetic ink. Other people thought it was funny. That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor when you don't have the contagion of humor. Humor is a type of entertainment. All entertainment contains a little frisson of danger  something that might happen wrong  and yet we like it when there's protection. That's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there. The bars protect us. That's sort of fun  right  That's a bad zoo. It's a very politically correct zoo  but it's a bad zoo. But this is a worse one. So in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker  you have to see  where is that tiger going to be  Where is the danger going to exist  How are you going to manage it  My job is to look at       cartoons a week. But The New Yorker only can take    or    cartoons  and we have       cartoons. Of course  many  many cartoons must be rejected. Now  we could fit more cartoons in the magazine if we removed the articles. But I feel that would be a huge loss  one I could live with  but still huge. Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week. The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does    or    ideas every week. But they mostly are going to be rejected. That's the nature of any creative activity. Many of them fade away. Some of them stay. Matt Diffee is one of them. Here's one of his cartoons. Drew Dernavich.  Accounting night at the improv.   Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience to shout out some random numbers.  Paul Noth.  He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro Israel.  Now I know all about rejection  because when I quit    actually  I was booted out of    psychology school and decided to become a cartoonist  a natural segue  from      to      I submitted       cartoons to The New Yorker  and got       cartoons rejected by The New Yorker. At a certain point  this rejection slip  in          We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.    magically changed to this.  Hey  You sold one. No shit  You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.  Now of course that's not what happened  but that's the emotional truth. And of course  that is not New Yorker humor. What is New Yorker humor  Well  after       I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons. Finally  in       I received the revered New Yorker contract  which I blurred out parts because it's none of your business. From     .  Dear Mr. Mankoff  confirming the agreement there of      blah blah blah blah    blur     for any idea drawings.  With respect to idea drawings  nowhere in the contract is the word  cartoon  mentioned. The word  idea drawings   and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons. So what is an idea drawing  An idea drawing is something that requires you to think. Now that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon. Here are some  generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.  There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just.  This is What Lemmings Believe. The New Yorker and I  when we made comments  the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is. What is it  the cartoon  Is it really about lemmings  No. It's about us. You know  it's my view basically about religion  that the real conflict and all the fights between religion is who has the best imaginary friend. And this is my most well known cartoon.  No  Thursday's out. How about never   is never good for you   It's been reprinted thousands of times  totally ripped off. It's even on thongs  but compressed to  How about never   is never good for you   Now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great similarity. In each instance  our expectations are defied. In each instance  the narrative gets switched. There's an incongruity and a contrast. In  No  Thursday's out. How about never   is never good for you   what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message of being rude. That really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy where we mash up these two things which don't go together and temporarily in our minds exist. He is both being polite and rude. In here  you have the propriety of The New Yorker and the vulgarity of the language. Basically  that's the way humor works. So I'm a humor analyst  you would say. Now E.B. White said  analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog. Nobody is much interested  and the frog dies. Well  I'm going to kill a few  but there won't be any genocide. But really  it makes me   Let's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture  The Laughing Audience. There are the people  fops up there  but everybody is laughing  everybody is laughing except one guy. This guy. Who is he  He's the critic. He's the critic of humor  and really I'm forced to be in that position  when I'm at The New Yorker  and that's the danger that I will become this guy. Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee  sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that. Ehhh. Oooh. Hmm. Too funny. Normally I would but I'm in a pissy mood. I'll enjoy it on my own. Perhaps. No. Nah. No. Overdrawn. Underdrawn. Drawn just right  still not funny enough. No. No. For God's sake no  a thousand times no. No. No. No. No. No.  Four hours later  Hey  that's good  yeah  whatcha got there  Office worker  Got a ham and swiss on rye BM  No. Office worker  Okay. Pastrami on sourdough BM  No. Office worker  Smoked turkey with bacon BM  No. Office worker  Falafel BM  Let me look at it. Eh  no. Office worker  Grilled cheese BM  No. Office worker  BLT BM  No. Office worker  Black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard BM  No. Office worker  Green bean salad BM  No. No. No. Definitely no.  Several hours after lunch  No. Get out of here. That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do. Now  we do reject  many  many  many cartoons  so many that there are many books called  The Rejection Collection.   The Rejection Collection  is not quite New Yorker kind of humor. And you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking. See  that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor. It's actually put together by Matt Diffee  one of our cartoonists. So I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.  I'm thinking about having a child.  There you have an interesting    the guilty laugh  the laugh against your better judgment.  Ass head. Please help.  Now  in fact  within a context of this book  which says   Cartoons you never saw and never will see in The New Yorker   this humor is perfect. I'm going to explain why. There's a concept about humor about it being a benign violation. In other words  for something to be funny  we've got to think it's both wrong and also okay at the same time. If we think it's completely wrong  we say   That's not funny.  And if it's completely okay  what's the joke  Okay  And so  this benign  that's true of  No  Thursday's out. How about never   is never good for you   It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way. Within that context  we feel it's okay. So within this context   Asshead. Please help  is a benign violation. Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...  T Cell Army  Can the body's immune response help treat cancer   Oh  goodness. You're reading about this smart stuff  this intelligent dissection of the immune system. You glance over at this  and it says   Asshead. Please help   God. So there the violation is malign. It doesn't work. There is no such thing as funny in and of itself. Everything will be within the context and our expectations. One way to look at it is this. It's sort of called a meta motivational theory about how we look  a theory about motivation and the mood we're in and how the mood we're in determines the things we like or dislike. When we're in a playful mood  we want excitement. We want high arousal. We feel excited then. If we're in a purposeful mood  that makes us anxious.  The Rejection Collection  is absolutely in this field. You want to be stimulated. You want to be aroused. You want to be transgressed. It's like this  like an amusement park. Voice  Here we go.  Screams  He laughs. He is both in danger and safe  incredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed. If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough  they will laugh at very  very little. This is another cartoon from  The Rejection Collection.   Too snug   That's a cartoon about terrorism. The New Yorker occupies a very different space. It's a space that is playful in its own way  and also purposeful  and in that space  the cartoons are different. Now I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did right after       a very  very sensitive area when humor could be used. How would The New Yorker attack it  It would not be with a guy with a bomb saying   Too snug   Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because actually I thought maybe people would be offended. The great Sam Gross cartoon  this happened after the Muhammad controversy where it's Muhammad in heaven  the suicide bomber is all in little pieces  and he's saying to the suicide bomber   You'll get the virgins when we find your penis.  Better left undrawn. The first week we did no cartoons. That was a black hole for humor  and correctly so. It's not always appropriate every time. But the next week  this was the first cartoon.  I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket.  It basically was about  if we were alive  we were going to laugh. We were going to breathe. We were going to exist. Here's another one.  I figure if I don't have that third martini  then the terrorists win.  These cartoons are not about them. They're about us. The humor reflects back on us. The easiest thing to do with humor  and it's perfectly legitimate  is a friend makes fun of an enemy. It's called dispositional humor. It's    percent of the humor. It's not our humor. Here's another cartoon.  I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state.  Humor does need a target. But interestingly  in The New Yorker  the target is us. The target is the readership and the people who do it. The humor is self reflective and makes us think about our assumptions. Look at this cartoon by Roz Chast  the guy reading the obituary.  Two years younger than you     years older than you  three years your junior  your age on the dot  exactly your age.  That is a deeply profound cartoon. And so The New Yorker is also trying to  in some way  make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us. Here's another one.  I started my vegetarianism for health reasons  Then it became a moral choice  and now it's just to annoy people.   Excuse me   I think there's something wrong with this in a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint.  So it focuses on our obsessions  our narcissism  our foils and our foibles  really not someone else's. The New Yorker demands some cognitive work on your part  and what it demands is what Arthur Koestler  who wrote  The Act of Creation  about the relationship between humor  art and science  is what's called bisociation. You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference  and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon. If the different frames of reference don't come together in about .  seconds  it's not funny  but I think they will for you here. Different frames of reference.  You slept with her  didn't you    Lassie  Get help    It's called French Army Knife. And this is Einstein in bed.  To you it was fast.  Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling. Like  this cartoon would puzzle many people. How many people know what this cartoon means  The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk. This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog. That's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called  I Don't Get It  The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test.  The other thing The New Yorker plays around with is incongruity  and incongruity  I've shown you  is sort of the basis of humor. Something that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny. But the way incongruity works is  observational humor is humor within the realm of reality.  My boss is always telling me what to do.  Okay  That could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality. Here  cowboy to a cow   Very impressive. I'd like to find       more like you.  We understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together. Here  in the nonsense range   Damn it  Hopkins  didn't you get yesterday's memo   Now that's a little puzzling  right  It doesn't quite come together. In general  people who enjoy more nonsense  enjoy more abstract art  they tend to be liberal  less conservative  that type of stuff. But for us  and for me  helping design the humor  it doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other. It's sort of a smorgasbord that's made all interesting. So I want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon  and I think this sums up the whole thing  really  about The New Yorker cartoons.  It sort of makes you stop and think  doesn't it.  And now  when you look at New Yorker cartoons  I'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about them. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  I do want to test this question we're all interested in  Does extinction have to be forever  I'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about. One is the Thylacine Project. The other one is the Lazarus Project  and that's focused on the gastric brooding frog. And it would be a fair question to ask  why have we focused on these two animals  Well  point number one  each of them represents a unique family of its own. We've lost a whole family. That's a big chunk of the global genome gone. I'd like it back. The second reason is that we killed these things. In the case of the thylacine  regrettably  we shot every one that we saw. We slaughtered them. In the case of the gastric brooding frog  we may have  fungicided  it to death. There's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world that's called the chytrid fungus  and it's nailing frogs all over the world. We think that's probably what got this frog  and humans are spreading this fungus. And this introduces a very important ethical point  and I think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up. What I think is important is that  if it's clear that we exterminated these species  then I think we not only have a moral obligation to see what we can do about it  but I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something  if we can. OK. Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project. It's a frog. And you think  frog. Yeah  but this was not just any frog. Unlike a normal frog  which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well  this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs  swallowed them into the stomach  where it should be having food  didn't digest the eggs  and turned its stomach into a uterus. In the stomach  the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles  and in the stomach  the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs  and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart. It has a little cough and a hiccup  and out comes sprays of little frogs. Now  when biologists saw this  they were agog. They thought  this is incredible. No animal  let alone a frog  has been known to do this  to change one organ in the body into another. And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well. If we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works  is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves  Now  I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach  but I am suggesting it's possible we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut. And just as everybody got excited about it  bang  It was extinct. I called up my friend  Professor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide. He was the last person who had this frog  a colony of these things  in his lab. And I said   Mike  by any chance     This was    or    years ago.  By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog   And he thought about it  and he went to his deep freezer  minus    degrees centigrade  and he poured through everything in the freezer  and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs. This was very exciting  but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work  because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it  cryoprotectants  to look after it when it was frozen. And normally  when water freezes  as you know  it expands  and the same thing happens in a cell. If you freeze tissues  the water expands  damages or bursts the cell walls. Well  we looked at the tissue under the microscope. It actually didn't look bad. The cell walls looked intact. So we thought  let's give it a go. What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation. We took the eggs of a related species  a living frog  and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg. We used ultraviolet radiation to do that. And then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that egg. Now  by rights  this is kind of like a cloning project  like what produced Dolly  but it's actually very different  because Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells. That was a miracle  but it was workable. What we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work. Well  we had no real reason to expect it would  and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these. And just last February  the last time we did these trials  I saw a miracle starting to happen. What we found was most of these eggs didn't work  but then suddenly  one of them began to divide. That was so exciting. And then the egg divided again. And then again. And pretty soon  we had early stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those. We even DNA tested some of these cells  and the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells. So we're very excited. This is not a tadpole. It's not a frog. But it's a long way along the journey to producing  or bringing back  an extinct species. And this is news. We haven't announced this publicly before. We're excited. We've got to get past this point. We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate  to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues. It'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog. Watch this space. I think we're going to have this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again. Thank you. We haven't done it yet  but keep the applause ready. The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project. The thylacine looks a bit  to most people  like a dog  or maybe like a tiger  because it has stripes. But it's not related to any of those. It's a marsupial. It raised its young in a pouch  like a koala or a kangaroo would do  and it has a long history  a long  fascinating history  that goes back    million years. But it's also a tragic history. The first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia about    million years ago  and the National Geographic Society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits. This is Riversleigh. In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals. We found marsupial lions. We found carnivorous kangaroos. It's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo  but these are meat eating kangaroos. We found the biggest bird in the world  bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar  and it too was a flesh eater. It was a giant  weird duck. And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either. You think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing  sitting in a pool of water. These crocodiles were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground. We had  in Australia  drop crocs. They really do exist. But what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals but also thylacines. There were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests  and they ranged from great big ones to middle sized ones to one that was about the size of a chihuahua. Paris Hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little handbag  until a drop croc landed on her. At any rate  it was a fascinating place  but unfortunately  Australia didn't stay this way. Climate change has affected the world for a long period of time  and gradually  the forests disappeared  the country began to dry out  and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline  until by five million years ago  only one left. By        years ago  they had disappeared from New Guinea  and unfortunately  by       years ago  somebodies  we don't know who this was  introduced dingoes    this is a very archaic kind of a dog    into Australia. And as you can see  dingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines. That similarity meant they probably competed. They were eating the same kinds of foods. It's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets  and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival. All we know is  soon after the dingoes were brought in  thylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland  and after that they only survived in Tasmania. Then  unfortunately  the next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in       and they brought with them the things they valued  and that included sheep. They took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania  and they thought  hang on  this is not going to work. That guy is going to eat all our sheep. That was not what happened  actually. Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep  but the thylacine got a bad rap. But immediately  the government said  that's it  let's get rid of them  and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw. By the early     s        to       thylacines had been murdered. It was a disaster  and they were about to hit the wall. Have a look at this bit of film footage. It makes me very sad because  while it's a fascinating animal  and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction  we didn't  unfortunately  at this same time  have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species. These are photos of the last surviving thylacine  Benjamin  who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart. To add insult to injury  having swept this species nearly off the table  this animal  when it died of neglect    The keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart. It died of exposure  and in the morning  when they found the body of Benjamin  they still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump. Does it have to stay this way  In       I was in the Australian Museum. I was fascinated by thylacines. I've always been obsessed with these animals. And I was studying skulls  trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals  and I saw this jar  and here  in the jar  was a little girl thylacine pup  perhaps six months old. The guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup  and they pickled it in alcohol. I'm a paleontologist  but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative. But this was       and I asked my geneticist friends  couldn't we think about going into this pup and extracting DNA  if it's there  and then somewhere down the line in the future  we'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back  The geneticists laughed. But this was six years before Dolly. Cloning was science fiction. It had not happened. But then suddenly cloning did happen. And I thought  when I became director of the Australian Museum  I'm going to give this a go. I put a team together. We went into that pup to see what was in it  and we did find thylacine DNA. It was a eureka moment. We were very excited. Unfortunately  we also found a lot of human DNA. Every old curator who'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen  put their hand in the jar  pulled it out and thought   Wow  look at that   plop  dropped it back in the jar  contaminating this specimen. And that was a worry. If the goal here was to get the DNA out and use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back  what we didn't want happening when the information was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed  was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine. It would've kept the curator very happy  but it wasn't going to keep us happy. So we went back to these specimens and we started digging around  and particularly  we looked into the teeth of skulls  hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers  and we found much better quality DNA. We found nuclear mitochondrial genes. It's there. So we got it. OK. What could we do with this stuff  Well  George Church  in his book   Regenesis   has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA. We would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form  and then  much like we've done with the Lazarus Project  get that stuff into an egg of a host species. It has to be a different species. What could it be  Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil  They're related  distantly  to thylacines. And then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end. Critics of this project say  hang on. Thylacine  Tasmanian devil  That's going to hurt. No  it's not. These are marsupials. They give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean. That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth. It is  shortly  going to think it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world  so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going. Andrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time. And it's sort of in the future  we haven't got there yet  but it's the kind of thing we want to think about. They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome  but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue green in the mouse baby. In other words  if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA  it would be able to be recognized. When the baby popped up  it was filled with blue green tissues. And that tells us if we can get that genome back together  get it into a live cell  it's going to produce thylacine stuff. Is this a risk  You've taken the bits of one animal and you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal. Are we going to get a Frankenstein  Some kind of weird hybrid chimera  And the answer is no. If the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA  that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil. OK  if we can do this  could we put it back  This is a key question for everybody. Does it have to stay in a laboratory  or could we put it back where it belongs  Could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania  restore that ecosystem  Or has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible  I've been to Tasmania. I've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common. I've even spoken to people  like Peter Carter here  who when I spoke to him  was    years old  but in       this man and his father and his brother caught thylacines. They trapped them. And when I spoke to this man  I was looking in his eyes and thinking   Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like  what they smelled like  what they sounded like.  He led them around on a rope. He has personal experiences that I would give my left leg to have in my head. We'd all love to have this sort of thing happen. Anyway  I asked Peter  by any chance  could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines. My interest was in whether the environment had changed. He thought hard. It was nearly    years before this that he'd been at this hut. At any rate  he led us down this bush track  and there  right where he remembered  was the hut  and tears came into his eyes. He looked at the hut. We went inside. There were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night. And he told me  as it all was flooding back in memories. He said   I remember the thylacines going around the hut wondering what was inside   and he said they made sounds like  Yip  Yip  Yip   All of these are parts of his life and what he remembers. And the key question for me was to ask Peter  has it changed  And he said no. The southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in     . The grasslands were sweeping away. That's classic thylacine habitat. And the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around. So could we put it back  Yes. Is that all we would do  And this is an interesting question. Sometimes you might be able to put it back  but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again  And I don't think so. I think gradually  as we see species all around the world  it's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild. We'd love to think it is  but we know it isn't. We need other parallel strategies coming online. And this one interests me. Some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos  sanctuaries  even at the museums  had collar marks on the neck. They were being kept as pets  and we know a lot of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets  and they say they were wonderful  friendly. This particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep. A wild animal. And I'd like to ask the question. We need to think about this. If it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then  would the thylacine be extinct now  And I'm positive it wouldn't. We need to think about this in today's world. Could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them  maybe they won't go extinct  And this is such a critical issue for us because if we don't do that  we're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice. As far as I'm concerned  this is why we're trying to do these kinds of de extinction projects. We are trying to restore that balance of nature that we have upset. Thank you. Well  Arthur C. Clarke  a famous science fiction writer from the     s  said that   We overestimate technology in the short term  and we underestimate it in the long term.  And I think that's some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots. That we're overestimating the technology in the short term. But I am worried whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term. Because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we  our society  is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future. So I'm scared we won't have enough robots. But fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time. Back in       there was a Spencer Tracy  Katharine Hepburn movie. So you know how it ended up  Spencer Tracy brought a computer  a mainframe computer of       in to help the librarians. The librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives   What are the names of Santa's reindeer   And they would look that up. And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job. Well of course a mainframe computer in      wasn't much use for that job. The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear. But that's not what happened in fact. The number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after     . It wasn't until the Internet came into play  the web came into play and search engines came into play that the need for librarians went down. And I think everyone from      totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today. And we can just ask   What are the names of Santa's reindeer   and be told instantly    or anything else we want to ask. By the way  the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period  because librarians became partners of computers. Computers became tools  and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time. Same thing happened in offices. Back in the old days  people used spreadsheets. Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper  and they calculated by hand. But here was an interesting thing that came along. With the revolution around      of P.C.'s  the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers  not to replace office workers  but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers. So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets. It increased their capabilities. They no longer had to do the mundane computations  but they could do something much more. Now today  we're starting to see robots in our lives. On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot. When soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan  instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick  as they used to do up until about       they now send the robot out. So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs. On the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh. These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S. And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry. They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen. They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy. And it frees up the nurses and the nurse's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients. In fact  robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways. But I think when it comes to factory robots  people are sort of afraid  because factory robots are dangerous to be around. In order to program them  you have to understand six dimensional vectors and quaternions. And ordinary people can't interact with them. And I think it's the sort of technology that's gone wrong. It's displaced the worker from the technology. And I think we really have to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with. And so I want to tell you today about Baxter  which we've been talking about. And Baxter  I see  as a way    a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting. So Baxter is up here. This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics. We've got a conveyor there. And if the lighting isn't too extreme    Ah  ah  There it is. It's picked up the object off the conveyor. It's going to come bring it over here and put it down. And then it'll go back  reach for another object. The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense. By the way  what's going on with the eyes  The eyes are on the screen there. The eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move. So a person that's interacting with the robot understands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions. Here Chris took the object out of its hand  and Baxter didn't go and try to put it down  it went back and realized it had to get another one. It's got a little bit of basic common sense  goes and picks the objects. And Baxter's safe to interact with. You wouldn't want to do this with a current industrial robot. But with Baxter it doesn't hurt. It feels the force  understands that Chris is there and doesn't push through him and hurt him. But I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface. And so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now. And when he grabs an arm  it goes into zero force gravity compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen. You can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm. He's going to put something in its hand  he's going to bring it over here  press a button and let go of that thing in the hand. And the robot figures out  ah  he must mean I want to put stuff down. It puts a little icon there. He comes over here  and he gets the fingers to grasp together  and the robot infers  ah  you want an object for me to pick up. That puts the green icon there. He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from. It just moves it around  and the robot figures out that was an area search. He didn't have to select that from a menu. And now he's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking. So as we continue here  I want to tell you about what this is like in factories. These robots we're shipping every day. They go to factories around the country. This is Mildred. Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut. She's worked on the line for over    years. One hour after she saw her first industrial robot  she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory. She decided she really liked robots. And it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand. Now she's got the robot doing it. When we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better  one of the questions we asked them was   Do you want your children to work in a factory   The universal answer was  No  I want a better job than that for my children.  And as a result of that  Mildred is very typical of today's factory workers in the U.S. They're older  and they're getting older and older. There aren't many young people coming into factory work. And as their tasks become more onerous on them  we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with  so that they can be part of the solution  so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S. And so our vision is that Mildred who's the line worker becomes Mildred the robot trainer. She lifts her game  like the office workers of the     s lifted their game of what they could do. We're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use. They're tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes. There's two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable. That's climate change and demographics. Demographics is really going to change our world. This is the percentage of adults who are working age. And it's gone down slightly over the last    years. But over the next    years  it's going to change dramatically  even in China. The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically. And turned up the other way  the people who are retirement age goes up very  very fast  as the baby boomers get to retirement age. That means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services. But more than that  as we get older we get more frail and we can't do all the tasks we used to do. If we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers  before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older. That's happening statistically right now. And as the number of people who are older  above retirement age and getting older  as they increase  there will be less people to take care of them. And I think we're really going to have to have robots to help us. And I don't mean robots in terms of companions. I mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older. Getting the groceries in from the car  up the stairs  into the kitchen. Or even  as we get very much older  driving our cars to go visit people. And I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution. So they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them. And so I really think that we're going to be spending more time with robots like Baxter and working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives. And that we will    Here  Baxter  it's good. And that we will all come to rely on robots over the next    years as part of our everyday lives. Thanks very much.
