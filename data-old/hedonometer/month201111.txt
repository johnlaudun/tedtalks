Is there anything unique about human beings  There is. We're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments. We're obsessed with morality as social creatures. We need to know why people are doing what they're doing. And I personally am obsessed with morality. It was all due to this woman  Sister Mary Marastela  also known as my mom. As an altar boy  I breathed in a lot of incense  and I learned to say phrases in Latin  but I also had time to think about whether my mother's top down morality applied to everybody. I saw that people who were religious and non religious were equally obsessed with morality. I thought  maybe there's some earthly basis for moral decisions. But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral. I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality. I want to know if there was a moral molecule. After    years of experiments  I found it. Would you like to see it  I brought some with me. This little syringe contains the moral molecule. It's called oxytocin. So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals. In rodents  it was known to make mothers care for their offspring  and in some creatures  allowed for toleration of burrowmates. But in humans  it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women  and is released by both sexes during sex. So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule. I did what most of us do    I tried it on some colleagues. One of them told me   Paul  that is the world's stupidist idea. It is   he said   only a female molecule. It can't be that important.  But I countered   Well men's brains make this too. There must be a reason why.  But he was right  it was a stupid idea. But it was testably stupid. In other words  I thought I could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral. Turns out it wasn't so easy. First of all  oxytocin is a shy molecule. Baseline levels are near zero  without some stimulus to cause its release. And when it's produced  it has a three minute half life  and degrades rapidly at room temperature. So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin  have to grab it fast and keep it cold. I think I can do that. Now luckily  oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood  so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery. Then I had to measure morality. So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project. So I started smaller. I studied one single virtue  trustworthiness. Why  I had shown in the early     s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous. So in these countries  more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created  alleviating poverty. So poor countries are by and large low trust countries. So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness  I might help alleviate poverty. But I'm also a skeptic. I don't want to just ask people   Are you trustworthy   So instead I use the Jerry Maguire approach to research. If you're so virtuous  show me the money. So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money. Let me show you how we do that. So we recruit some people for an experiment. They all get     if they agree to show up. We give them lots of instruction  and we never ever deceive them. Then we match them in pairs by computer. And in that pair  one person gets a message saying   Do you want to give up some of your     you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab   The trick is you can't see them  you can't talk to them. You only do it one time. Now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person's account. You're going to make them a lot wealthier. And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money. Do you want to keep it all  or do you want to send some amount back  So think about this experiment for minute. You're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half. Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood. And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger  So this was the birth of vampire economics. Make a decision and give me some blood. So in fact  experimental economists had run this test around the world  and for much higher stakes  and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust  and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness. But in fact  economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money. They assumed money is good  why not keep it all  That's not what we found. We found    percent of the first decision makers sent money  and of those who received money     percent returned some of it. But why  Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received  the more their brain produced oxytocin  and the more oxytocin on board  the more money they returned. So we have a biology of trustworthiness. But wait. What's wrong with this experiment  Two things. One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation. So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin  but they didn't have any effect. But the second is that I still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness. I didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness. So to make the experiment  I knew I'd have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly. I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain. And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler. So along with colleagues in Zurich  we put     men on oxytocin or placebo  had that same trust test with money  and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust  we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger    all without altering mood or cognition. So oxytocin is the trust molecule  but is it the moral molecule  Using the oxytocin inhaler  we ran more studies. We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by    percent. We showed it increases donations to charity by    percent. We've also investigated non pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin. These include massage  dancing and praying. Yes  my mom was happy about that last one. And whenever we raise oxytocin  people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers. But why do they do this  What does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin  To investigate this question  we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year old son  and his son has terminal brain cancer. After they watched the video  we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin. The change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy. So it's empathy that makes us connect to other people. It's empathy that makes us help other people. It's empathy that makes us moral. Now this idea is not new. A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith wrote a book in      called  The Theory of Moral Sentiments.  In this book  Smith argued that we are moral creatures  not because of a top down reason  but for a bottom up reason. He said we're social creatures  so we share the emotions of others. So if I do something that hurts you  I feel that pain. So I tend to avoid that. If I do something that makes you happy  I get to share your joy. So I tend to do those things. Now this is the same Adam Smith who     years later  would write a little book called  The Wealth of Nations     the founding document of economics. But he was  in fact  a moral philosopher  and he was right on why we're moral. I just found the molecule behind it. But knowing that molecule is valuable  because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off. In particular  it tells us why we see immorality. So to investigate immorality  let me bring you back now to     . I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara  California. You sit in a gas station all day  you see lots of morality and immorality  let me tell you. So one Sunday afternoon  a man walks into my cashier's booth with this beautiful jewelry box. Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside. And he said   Hey  I was in the men's room. I just found this. What do you think we should do with it    I don't know  put it in the lost and found.   Well this is very valuable. We have to find the owner for this.  I said   Yea.  So we're trying to decide what to do with this  and the phone rings. And a man says very excitedly   I was in your gas station a while ago  and I bought this jewelry for my wife  and I can't find it.  I said   Pearl necklace    Yeah.   Hey  a guy just found it.   Oh  you're saving my life. Here's my phone number. Tell that guy to wait half an hour. I'll be there and I'll give him a      reward.  Great  so I tell the guy   Look  relax. Get yourself a fat reward. Life's good.  He said   I can't do it. I have this job interview in Galena in    minutes  and I need this job  I've got to go.  Again he asked me   What do you think we should do   I'm in high school. I have no idea. So I said   I'll hold it for you.  He said   You know  you've been so nice  let's split the reward.  I'll give you the jewelry  you give me a hundred dollars  and when the guy comes ...   You see it. I was conned. So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop  and I was the pigeon. So the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him  it's that he shows he trusts the victim. Now we know what happens. The victim's brain releases oxytocin  and you're opening up your wallet or purse  giving away the money. So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems  We found  testing thousands of individuals  that five percent of the population don't release oxytocin on stimulus. So if you trust them  their brains don't release oxytocin. If there's money on the table  they keep it all. So there's a technical word for these people in my lab. We call them bastards. These are not people you want to have a beer with. They have many of the attributes of psychopaths. Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited. One is through improper nurturing. So we've studied sexually abused women  and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus. You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly. Also  high stress inhibits oxytocin. So we all know this  when we're really stressed out  we're not acting our best. There's another way oxytocin is inhibited  which is interesting    through the action of testosterone. So we  in experiments  have administered testosterone to men. And instead of sharing money  they become selfish. But interestingly  high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish. Now think about this. It means  within our own biology  we have the yin and yang of morality. We have oxytocin that connects us to others  makes us feel what they feel. And we have testosterone. And men have    times the testosterone as women  so men do this more than women    we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally. We don't need God or government telling us what to do. It's all inside of us. So you may be wondering  these are beautiful laboratory experiments  do they really apply to real life  Yeah  I've been worrying about that too. So I've gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives. So last summer  I attended a wedding in Southern England.     people in this beautiful Victorian mansion. I didn't know a single person. And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall. And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes. And I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows. And guess what  Weddings cause a release of oxytocin  but they do so in a very particular way. Who is the center of the wedding solar system  The bride. She had the biggest increase in oxytocin. Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride  Her mother  that's right. Her mother was number two. Then the groom's father  then the groom  then the family  then the friends    arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun. So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple  connect us emotionally. Why  Because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species. I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers. So even though I have a fear of heights  I recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at        ft. I took my blood before and after  and I had a huge spike of oxytocin. And there are so many ways we can connect to people. For example  through social media. Many people are Tweeting right now. So we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double digit increase in oxytocin. So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System. And they had the reporters and their producers participate. And one of these guys  he must have been     he had     percent spike in oxytocin. I mean  astounding  no one has this. So he was using social media in private. When I wrote my report to the Koreans  I said   Look  I don't know what this guy was doing   but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend. They checked. He was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page. There you go. That's connection. So there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people  and it seems to be universal. Two weeks ago  I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands    very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia. There are     different languages in the highlands. These are the most primitive people in the world. And they indeed also release oxytocin. So oxytocin connects us to other people. Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel. And it's so easy to cause people's brains to release oxytocin. I know how to do it  and my favorite way to do it is  in fact  the easiest. Let me show it to you. Come here. Give me a hug. There you go. So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname Dr. Love. I'm happy to share a little more love in the world  it's great  but here's your prescription from Dr. Love  eight hugs a day. We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier. And they're happier because they have better relationships of all types. Dr. Love says eight hugs a day. Eight hugs a day    you'll be happier and the world will be a better place. Of course  if you don't like to touch people  I can always shove this up your nose. Thank you. What is it about flying cars  We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years. And there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success. But we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really  truly seamlessly integrates the two dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three dimensional sky above us    that  I don't know about you  but I really enjoy spending time in. We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that  despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren't available previously    we have modern composite materials  we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy and have better power to rate ratios than have ever been available  we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly directly to you in the cockpit    but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective  we realized that we were going to be getting the same result that people had been getting for the last hundred years  which isn't where we want to be right now. So instead of trying to make a car that can fly  we decided to try to make a plane that could drive. And the result is the Terrafugia Transition. It's a two seat  single engine airplane that works just like any other small airplane. You take off and land at a local airport. Then once you're on the ground  you fold up the wings  drive it home  park it in your garage. And it works. After two years of an innovative design and construction process  the proof of concept made its public debut in     . Now like with anything that's really different from the status quo  it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft. And we discovered that it's a very good thing that  when you go home with something that's been broken  you've actually learned a lot more than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives the first time through. Still  we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we'd all helped build in the air  off the ground  like it was supposed to be. And on our third high speed testing deployment on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York  we got to do that for the first time. The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time. And we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over. The flight testing that followed that was as basic and low risk as we could make it  but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market  the general aviation community  and with the regulators that govern the use of design of aircraft  particularly in the States. The FAA  about a year ago  gave us an exemption for the Transition to allow us to have an additional     lbs. within the light sport aircraft category. Now that doesn't sound like a lot  but it's very important  because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it  but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it. A sport pilot can be certificated in as little as    hours of flight time. And at     lbs.  that's very important for solving the other side of the equation    driving. It turns out that driving  with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles  is actually a harder problem to solve than flying. For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground  this may be counter intuitive  but driving has potholes  cobblestones  pedestrians  other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with. Fortunately  necessity remains the mother of invention  and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground    everything from a continuously variable transmission and liquid based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop and go traffic  to a custom designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground  to the automated wing folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment  to crash safety features. We have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than    percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car. Now this also  as good as it is  wasn't quite enough. The regulations for vehicles on the road weren't written with an airplane in mind. So we did need a little bit of support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Now you may have seen in the news recently  they came through with us at the end of last month with a few special exemptions that will allow the Transition to be sold in the same category as SUVs and light trucks. As a multi purpose passenger vehicle  it is now officially  designed for occasional off road use.  Now let's see it in action. You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane. You're not powering the propeller  you're powering the wheels. And it is under seven feet tall  so it will fit in a standard construction garage. And that's the automated wing folding mechanism. That's real time. You just push a few buttons in the cockpit  and the wings come out. Once they're fully deployed  there's a mechanical lock that goes into place  again  from inside the cockpit. And they're now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight    just like putting down your convertible top. And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.    percent of your risk is that first flight. Radio  It actually flew. Yes. Radio    That was gorgeous. Radio  What did you think of that  That was beautiful from up here  I tell you. AMD  See  we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop. And our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight  which was that it was  remarkably unremarkable.  He would go onto tell us that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he'd flown in his entire    year career as a test pilot. So despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary  we really focused on doing as little new as possible. We leverage a lot of technology from the state of the art in general aviation and from automotive racing. When we do have to do something truly out of the box  we use an incremental design  build  test  redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps. Now since we started Terrafugia about   years ago  we've had a lot of those baby steps. We've gone from being three of us working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school to about two dozen of us working in an initial production facility outside of Boston. We've had to overcome challenges like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about  figuring out how to politely respond when a regulator tells you   But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended    to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues that we talked about on the ground. Still  if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and construction of the two production prototypes that we're working on right now  those first deliveries to the  about a hundred  people who have reserved an airplane at this point should begin at the end of next year. The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes. And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy  but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane. Here's why. While nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports  there is a huge underutilized resource out there. There are thousands of local airstrips that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could. On average  there's one within    to    miles of wherever you are in the United States. The Transition gives you a safer  more convenient and more fun way of using this resource. For those of you who aren't yet pilots  there's four main reasons why those of us who are don't fly as much as we'd like to  the weather  primarily  cost  long door to door travel time and mobility at your destination. Now  bad weather comes in  just land  fold up the wings  drive home. Doesn't matter if it rains a little  you have a windshield wiper. Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger  park it in your garage. And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas. Door to door travel time is reduced  because now  instead of lugging bags  finding a parking space  taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger  you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go. And mobility to your destination is clearly solved. Just fold up the wings and keep going. The Transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller  more accessible place. It also continues to be a fabulous adventure. I hope you'll each take a moment to think about how you could use something like this to give yourself more access to your own world  and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you. I'm a neuroscientist. And in neuroscience  we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain. But I want to start with the easiest question and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life  because it's a fundamental question if we want to understand brain function. And that is  why do we and other animals have brains  Not all species on our planet have brains  so if we want to know what the brain is for  let's think about why we evolved one. Now you may reason that we have one to perceive the world or to think  and that's completely wrong. If you think about this question for any length of time  it's blindingly obvious why we have a brain. We have a brain for one reason and one reason only  and that's to produce adaptable and complex movements. There is no other reason to have a brain. Think about it. Movement is the only way you have of affecting the world around you. Now that's not quite true. There's one other way  and that's through sweating. But apart from that  everything else goes through contractions of muscles. So think about communication    speech  gestures  writing  sign language    they're all mediated through contractions of your muscles. So it's really important to remember that sensory  memory and cognitive processes are all important  but they're only important to either drive or suppress future movements. There can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life. Now for those who don't believe this argument  we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain  but the clinching evidence is this animal here    the humble sea squirt. Rudimentary animal  has a nervous system  swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life. And at some point of its life  it implants on a rock. And the first thing it does in implanting on that rock  which it never leaves  is to digest its own brain and nervous system for food. So once you don't need to move  you don't need the luxury of that brain. And this animal is often taken as an analogy to what happens at universities when professors get tenure  but that's a different subject. So I am a movement chauvinist. I believe movement is the most important function of the brain    don't let anyone tell you that it's not true. Now if movement is so important  how well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement  And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly  it's a very hard problem. But we can look at how well we're doing by thinking about how well we're doing building machines which can do what humans can do. Think about the game of chess. How well are we doing determining what piece to move where  If you pit Garry Kasparov here  when he's not in jail  against IBM's Deep Blue  well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win. And I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room  it would win every time. That problem is solved. What about the problem of picking up a chess piece  dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board  If you put a five year old child's dexterity against the best robots of today  the answer is simple  the child wins easily. There's no competition at all. Now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard  One reason is a very smart five year old could tell you the algorithm for that top problem    look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win. So it's a very simple algorithm. Now of course there are other moves  but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution. When it comes to being dexterous  it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous. And we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world  which has a lot of problems. But let me show you cutting edge robotics. Now a lot of robotics is very impressive  but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages. So this is the end of a Ph.D. project from one of the best robotics institutes. And the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass. It's a hard problem because the water sloshes about  but it can do it. But it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human. Now if you want this robot to do a different task  that's another three year Ph.D. program. There is no generalization at all from one task to another in robotics. Now we can compare this to cutting edge human performance. So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox winning the world record for cup stacking. Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking. It's a high school sport where you have    cups you have to stack and unstack against the clock in a prescribed order. And this is her getting the world record in real time. And she's pretty happy. We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that  and that's what we'd like to know. So in my group  what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement. And it sounds like an easy problem. You send a command down  it causes muscles to contract. Your arm or body moves  and you get sensory feedback from vision  from skin  from muscles and so on. The trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be. So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is  for example  sensory feedback is extremely noisy. Now by noise  I do not mean sound. We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal. So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard  crrcckkk  on the station you wanted to hear  that was the noise. But more generally  this noise is something that corrupts the signal. So for example  if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand  you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback. Similarly  when you put motor output on movement output  it's extremely noisy. Forget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts  just aim for the same spot over and over again. You have a huge spread due to movement variability. And more than that  the outside world  or task  is both ambiguous and variable. The teapot could be full  it could be empty. It changes over time. So we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise. Now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise. So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick  our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars. Now what I want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability. And to do that  I'm going to tell you about a framework which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last    years called Bayesian decision theory. And it's more recently a unifying way to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty. And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions. So let's think about the inference. You want to generate beliefs about the world. So what are beliefs  Beliefs could be  where are my arms in space  Am I looking at a cat or a fox  But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities. So we're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one    zero meaning I don't believe it at all  one means I'm absolutely certain. And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty. And the key idea to Bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference. You have data  and data in neuroscience is sensory input. So I have sensory input  which I can take in to make beliefs. But there's another source of information  and that's effectively prior knowledge. You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories. And the point about Bayesian decision theory is it gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs. And I've put the formula up there. I'm not going to explain what that formula is  but it's very beautiful. And it has real beauty and real explanatory power. And what it really says  and what you want to estimate  is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input. So let me give you an intuitive example. Imagine you're learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you. There are two sources of information Bayes' rule tells you. There's sensory evidence    you can use visual information auditory information  and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot. But you know that your senses are not perfect  and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red  representing numbers between  .  and maybe  . . That information is available in the current shot  but there's another source of information not available on the current shot  but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis  and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match. If you're playing against a very good opponent  they may distribute it in that green area  which is the prior distribution  making it hard for you to return. Now both these sources of information carry important information. And what Bayes' rule says is that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow  which have the ellipses  and that's my belief. So it's the optimal way of combining information. Now I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago  we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills. And what it means is we really are Bayesian inference machines. As we go around  we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down  but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is  and then combine those in a real Bayesian way. Now a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula. And what this part really says is I have to predict the probability of different sensory feedbacks given my beliefs. So that really means I have to make predictions of the future. And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback it's going to get. And moreover  it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do. And to do that  I'll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input. So you send a command out  you get sensory feedback back  and that transformation is governed by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus. But you can imagine looking inside the brain. And here's inside the brain. You might have a little predictor  a neural simulator  of the physics of your body and your senses. So as you send a movement command down  you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions. So as I shake this ketchup bottle  I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row. And if I've got a good predictor  it predicts the same thing. Well why would I bother doing that  I'm going to get the same feedback anyway. Well there's good reasons. Imagine  as I shake the ketchup bottle  someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me. Now I get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act. So I get two sources. I get you tapping on it  and I get me shaking it  but from my senses' point of view  that is combined together into one source of information. Now there's good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events. Because external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant than feeling everything that's going on inside my body. So one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction    which is only based on your movement commands    with the reality. Any discrepancy should hopefully be external. So as I go around the world  I'm making predictions of what I should get  subtracting them off. Everything left over is external to me. What evidence is there for this  Well there's one very clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person. And so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling. It's been known for a long time  you can't tickle yourself as well as other people can. But it hasn't really been shown  it's because you have a neural simulator  simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense. So we can bring the experiments of the   st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem. And in effect  what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot  and they're going to move that back and forward. And then we're going to track that with a computer and use it to control another robot  which is going to tickle their palm with another stick. And then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things including ticklishness. I'll show you just one part of our study. And here I've taken away the robots  but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward. And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay. Either no time delay  in which case light would just tickle your palm  or with a time delay of two tenths of three tenths of a second. So the important point here is the right hand always does the same things    sinusoidal movement. The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle. All we're playing with is a tempo causality. And as we go from naught to  .  second  it becomes more ticklish. As you go from  .  to  .   it becomes more ticklish at the end. And by  .  of a second  it's equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything. So whatever is responsible for this cancellation is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality. And based on this illustration  we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations. Now I have to admit  these are the worst studies my lab has ever run. Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes  you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant. So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena. And in the intervening years I had two daughters. And one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys  they get into fights    which started with one of them doing something to the other  the other retaliating. It quickly escalates. And children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force. Now when I screamed at my children to stop  sometimes they would both say to me the other person hit them harder. Now I happen to know my children don't lie  so I thought  as a neuroscientist  it was important how I could explain how they were telling inconsistent truths. And we hypothesize based on the tickling study that when one child hits another  they generate the movement command. They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off. So they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have    rather like the tickling. Whereas the passive recipient doesn't make the prediction  feels the full blow. So if they retaliate with the same force  the first person will think it's been escalated. So we decided to test this in the lab. Now we don't work with children  we don't work with hitting  but the concept is identical. We bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game. And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other. And the game is very simple. We started with a motor with a little lever  a little force transfuser. And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers for three seconds and then it stops. And that player's been told  remember the experience of that force and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser    and they do that. And player two's been told  remember the experience of that force. Use your other hand to apply the force back down. And so they take it in turns to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward. But critically  they're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms. So they don't know the rules the other person's playing by. And what we've measured is the force as a function of terms. And if we look at what we start with  a quarter of a Newton there  a number of turns  perfect would be that red line. And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this    a    percent escalation in force on each go. So it really suggests  when you're doing this    based on this study and others we've done    that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it's producing. So it re shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts. So we've made inferences  we've done predictions  now we have to generate actions. And what Bayes' rule says is  given my beliefs  the action should in some sense be optimal. But we've got a problem. Tasks are symbolic    I want to drink  I want to dance    but the movement system has to contract     muscles in a particular sequence. And there's a big gap between the task and the movement system. So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways. So think about just a point to point movement. I could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths. Having chosen a particular path  I can hold my hand on that path as infinitely many different joint configurations. And I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed. So I have a huge amount of choice to make. Now it turns out  we are extremely stereotypical. We all move the same way pretty much. And so it turns out we're so stereotypical  our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping. So if I take some dots and set them in motion with biological motion  your brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on. Now this is a bunch of dots moving. You will know what this person is doing  whether happy  sad  old  young    a huge amount of information. If these dots were cars going on a racing circuit  you would have absolutely no idea what's going on. So why is it that we move the particular ways we do  Well let's think about what really happens. Maybe we don't all quite move the same way. Maybe there's variation in the population. And maybe those who move better than others have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation. So in evolutionary scales  movements get better. And perhaps in life  movements get better through learning. So what is it about a movement which is good or bad  Imagine I want to intercept this ball. Here are two possible paths to that ball. Well if I choose the left hand path  I can work out the forces required in one of my muscles as a function of time. But there's noise added to this. So what I actually get  based on this lovely  smooth  desired force  is a very noisy version. So if I pick the same command through many times  I will get a different noisy version each time  because noise changes each time. So what I can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if I choose that way. If I choose a different way of moving    on the right for example    then I'll have a different command  different noise  playing through a noisy system  very complicated. All we can be sure of is the variability will be different. If I move in this particular way  I end up with a smaller variability across many movements. So if I have to choose between those two  I would choose the right one because it's less variable. And the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise. And one intuition to get is actually the amount of noise or variability I show here gets bigger as the force gets bigger. So you want to avoid big forces as one principle. So we've shown that using this  we can explain a huge amount of data    that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise. So I hope I've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement. And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that. But it's also relevant for disease and rehabilitation. There are many diseases which effect movement. And hopefully if we understand how we control movement  we can apply that to robotic technology. And finally  I want to remind you  when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks  the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Quick question for you  Dan. So you're a movement     DW  Chauvinist.     chauvinist. Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about    the dreaming  the yearning  the falling in love and all these things    are a kind of side show  an accident  DW  No  no  actually I think they're all important to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end. So I think people who study sensation or memory without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood. The fact that we forget most of our childhood  for example  is probably fine  because it doesn't effect our movements later in life. You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement. CA  So you think that people thinking about the brain  and consciousness generally  could get real insight by saying  where does movement play in this game  DW  So people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision is a mistake. You have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision. And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way. CA  Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed. So historically there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non living systems on one side  and living systems on the other side. So we go from  say  this beautiful and complex crystal as non life  and this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side. Over the last hundred and fifty years or so  science has kind of blurred this distinction between non living and living systems  and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two. We'll just take one example here  a virus is a natural system  right  But it's very simple. It's very simplistic. It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements  it doesn't have all the characteristics of living systems and is in fact a parasite on other living systems in order to  say  reproduce and evolve. But what we're going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non living end of this spectrum    so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory  mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures  and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems. Really what I'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life. So what are these characteristics that I'm talking about  These are them. We consider first that life has a body. Now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment. Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself. Life also has a kind of inheritable information. Now we  as humans  we store our information as DNA in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring. If we couple the first two    the body and the metabolism    we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate  and if we coupled these now to inheritable information  we can come up with a system that would be more lifelike  and would perhaps evolve. And so these are the things we will try to do in the lab  make some experiments that have one or more of these characteristics of life. So how do we do this  Well  we use a model system that we term a protocell. You might think of this as kind of like a primitive cell. It is a simple chemical model of a living cell  and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together  play together in a complex network to produce something that we call alive. In the laboratory what we want to do is much the same  but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules    so a drastic reduction in complexity  but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike. And so what we do is  we start simple and we work our way up to living systems. Consider for a moment this quote by Leduc  a hundred years ago  considering a kind of synthetic biology   The synthesis of life  should it ever occur  will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea.  That's his first statement. So if we actually create life in the laboratories  it's probably not going to impact our lives at all.  If we accept the theory of evolution  then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world  or between the non living and living world  forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life     so  the ones I just discussed     to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment.  So we start simple  we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life  and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike. This is how we can start to make a protocell. We use this idea called self assembly. What that means is  I can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab  and these chemicals will start to self associate to form larger and larger structures. So say on the order of tens of thousands  hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn't exist before. And in this particular example  what I took is some membrane molecules  mixed those together in the right environment  and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here. These membranes are also quite similar  morphologically and functionally  to the membranes in your body  and we can use these  as they say  to form the body of our protocell. Likewise  we can work with oil and water systems. As you know  when you put oil and water together  they don't mix  but through self assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form  and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell  as you will see later. So that's just forming some body stuff  right  Some architectures. What about the other aspects of living systems  So we came up with this protocell model here that I'm showing. We started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite. This is natural from the environment  this clay. It forms a surface that is  say  chemically active. It could run a metabolism on it. Certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay. For example  in this case  RNA  shown in red    this is a relative of DNA  it's an informational molecule    it can come along and it starts to associate with the surface of this clay. This structure  then  can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself  so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself  and that's shown in green here on this micrograph. So just through self assembly  mixing things together in the lab  we can come up with  say  a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body  right  So we're on a road towards living systems. But if you saw this protocell  you would not confuse this with something that was actually alive. It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms  it doesn't really do anything. So  something is missing. Some things are missing. So some things that are missing is  for example  if you had a flow of energy through a system  what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself  much like living systems do. So we came up with a different protocell model  and this is actually simpler than the previous one. In this protocell model  it's just an oil droplet  but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something  to actually become dynamic  as we'll see here. You add the droplet to the system. It's a pool of water  and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system. Okay  Oil droplet forms through self assembly  has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy  and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment. As we heard earlier  movement is very important in these kinds of living systems. It is moving around  exploring its environment  and remodeling its environment  as you see  by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell. So it's acting  in a sense  like a living system trying to preserve itself. We take this same moving protocell here  and we put it in another experiment  get it moving. Then I'm going to add some food to the system  and you'll see that in blue here  right  So I add some food source to the system. The protocell moves. It encounters the food. It reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there. Alright  So not only do we have this system that has a body  it has a metabolism  it can use energy  it moves around. It can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself. Now  this doesn't have a brain  it doesn't have a neural system. This is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior. If we count the number of chemicals in that system  actually  including the water that's in the dish  we have five chemicals that can do this. So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do  and depending on the conditions  we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment. On the other hand we have two moving protocells that like to circle each other  and they form a kind of a dance  a complex dance with each other. Right  So not only do individual protocells have behavior  what we've interpreted as behavior in this system  but we also have basically population level behavior similar to what organisms have. So now that you're all experts on protocells  we're going to play a game with these protocells. We're going to make two different kinds. Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry inside that  when activated  the protocell starts to vibrate around  just dancing. So remember  these are primitive things  so dancing protocells  that's very interesting to us.  Laughter  The second protocell has a different chemistry inside  and when activated  the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one. Right  And we just put these two together in the same system. So there's population A  there's population B  and then we activate the system  and protocell Bs  they're the blue ones  they all come together. They fuse together to form one big blob  and the other protocell just dances around. And this just happens until all of the energy in the system is basically used up  and then  game over. So then I repeated this experiment a bunch of times  and one time something very interesting happened. So  I added these protocells together to the system  and protocell A and protocell B fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB. That didn't happen before. There it goes. There's a protocell AB now in this system. Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit  while protocell B does the fusing  okay  But then something even more interesting happens. Watch when these two large protocells  the hybrid ones  fuse together. Now we have a dancing protocell and a self replication event. Right.  Laughter  Just with blobs of chemicals  again. So the way this works is  you have a simple system of five chemicals here  a simple system here. When they hybridize  you then form something that's different than before  it's more complex than before  and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior which in this case is replication. So since we can make some interesting protocells that we like  interesting colors and interesting behaviors  and they're very easy to make  and they have interesting lifelike properties  perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an easily accessible step  one of the first steps by which life got started on the early Earth. Certainly  there were molecules present on the early Earth  but they wouldn't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and I showed in these experiments. Rather  they'd be a real complex mixture of all kinds of stuff  because uncontrolled chemical reactions produce a diverse mixture of organic compounds. Think of it like a primordial ooze  okay  And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully characterize  even by modern methods  and the product looks brown  like this tar here on the left. A pure compound is shown on the right  for contrast. So this is similar to what happens when you take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen  you put them in a pan  and you apply energy. You turn up the heat  you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar  forming a brownish caramel  right  If you let that go unregulated  you'll continue to make and break chemical bonds  forming an even more diverse mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan  right  that's difficult to wash out. So that's what the origin of life would have looked like. You needed to get life out of this junk that is present on the early Earth  four   .  billion years ago. So the challenge then is  throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab  and try to make some protocells with lifelike properties from this kind of primordial ooze. So we're able to then see the self assembly of these oil droplet bodies again that we've seen previously  and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar    this diverse  very complex  organic black tar. And we put them into one of these experiments  as you've seen earlier  and then we watch lively movement that comes out. They look really good  very nice movement  and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other  similar to what we've seen before    but again  working with just primordial conditions  no pure chemicals. These are also  these tar fueled protocells  are also able to locate resources in their environment. I'm going to add some resource from the left  here  that defuses into the system  and you can see  they really like that. They become very energetic  and able to find the resource in the environment  similar to what we saw before. But again  these are done in these primordial conditions  really messy conditions  not sort of sterile laboratory conditions. These are very dirty little protocells  as a matter of fact.  Laughter  But they have lifelike properties  is the point. So  doing these artificial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non living and living systems. And not only that  but it helps us broaden our view of what life is and what possible life there could be out there    life that could be very different from life that we find here on Earth. And that leads me to the next term  which is  weird life.  This is a term by Steve Benner. This is used in reference to a report in      by the National Research Council in the United States  wherein they tried to understand how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe  okay  especially if that life is very different from life on Earth. If we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there  how could we even recognize it as life  Well  they came up with three very general criteria. First is    and they're listed here. The first is  the system has to be in non equilibrium. That means the system cannot be dead  in a matter of fact. Basically what that means is  you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to maintain itself. This is similar to having the Sun shining on the Earth  driving photosynthesis  driving the ecosystem. Without the Sun  there's likely to be no life on this planet. Secondly  life needs to be in liquid form  so that means even if we had some interesting structures  interesting molecules together but they were frozen solid  then this is not a good place for life. And thirdly  we need to be able to make and break chemical bonds. And again this is important because life transforms resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain itself. Now today  I told you about very strange and weird protocells    some that contain clay  some that have primordial ooze in them  some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them. Most of these don't contain DNA  but yet they have lifelike properties. But these protocells satisfy these general requirements of living systems. So by making these chemical  artificial life experiments  we hope not only to understand something fundamental about the origin of life and the existence of life on this planet  but also what possible life there could be out there in the universe. Thank you. Hi. Today  I'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects  done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors. We call ourselves Pors and Rao  and we live and work in India. I'd like to begin with my very first object  which I call  The Uncle Phone.  And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him  almost like I were an extension of his body    to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water  a pack of cigarettes. And as I grew up  it became worse and worse  And I started to think of it as a form of control. But of course  I could never say anything  because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family. And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone. He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him. And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle  I made him  The Uncle Phone.  It's so long that it requires two people to use it. It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person. But the problem is that  when I left home and went to college  I started missing his commands. And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email. So what he had to do was take a piece of paper  roll it into the carriage  type his email or command and pull the paper out. This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email. So here you can see  we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital. So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface. And of course  the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism  the way my uncle likes it. The next work is a sound sensitive installation that we affectionately call  The Pygmies.  And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy  sensitive and sweet creatures. So how it works is we have these panels  which we have on the wall  and behind them  we have these little creatures which hide. And as soon as it's silent  they sort of creep out. And if it's even more silent  they stretch their necks out. And at the slightest sound  they hide back again. So we had these panels on three walls of a room. And we had over     of these little pygmies hiding behind them. So this is how it works. This is a video prototype. So when it's quiet  it's sort of coming out from behind the panels. And they hear like humans do  or real creatures do. So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile. And they don't react to background sounds. You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to. But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second. So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible. So each pygmy has its own behavior  psyche  mood swings  personalities and so on. So this is a very early prototype. Of course  it got much better after that. And we made them react to people  but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them. This is a video installation called  The Missing Person.  And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility. How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility  So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance  and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us  using a camera that could look at people in the room  track them and replace one person with the background  rendering them invisible. So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype. On the right side you can see my colleague Soren  who's actually in the space. And on the left side  you'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible. Soren enters the room. Pop  He goes invisible. And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing. It's a very early video  so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that  but that got refined pretty soon  later. So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space  and we had one monitor  one on each wall. And as people walked into the room  they would see themselves in the monitor  except with one difference  one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room. So this is a work called  The Sun Shadow.  And it was almost like a sheet of paper  like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun. And from the front  this object appeared to be very strong and robust  and from the side  it almost seemed very weak. So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it  thinking it was some crap laying around. But as soon as they passed by  it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion. And it would get exhausted  and it would collapse every time. So this work is a caricature of an upside down man. His head is so heavy  full of heavy thoughts  that it's sort of fallen into his hat  and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant. Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement. And it's kind of constrained by that circle. Because if that circle weren't there  and the floor was very even  it would start to wander about in the space. And there's no wires. So I'll just show you an instance    so when people enter the room  it activates this object. And it very slowly  over a few minutes  sort of painfully goes up  and then it gains momentum and it looks like it's almost about to fall. And this is an important moment  because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help  or save the subject. But it doesn't really need it  because it  again  sort of manages to pull itself up. So this work was a real technical challenge for us  and we worked very hard  like most of our works  over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics. And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall  because if we made it in a way that it would topple over  then it would damage itself  and if it didn't fall enough  it wouldn't instill that fatalism  or that sense of wanting to go and help it. So I'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario    it's much faster. That's my colleague. He's let it go. Now he's getting nervous  so he's going to go catch it. But he doesn't need to  because it manages to lift itself up on its own. So this is a work that we were very intrigued with  working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics  which twinkle like the night sky. And it's at the scale of the night sky. So we wrapped this around a blob like form  which is in the shape of a teddy bear  which was hanging from the ceiling. And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear  which is very comforting and intimate. And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space  and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky. So this is the last work  and a work in progress  and it's called  Space Filler.  Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room  and as you approached it  it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and  eight  times its volume. And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it    almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something. So we work with a lot of technology  but we don't really love technology  because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years. But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create. And once a creature pops into our minds  it's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move. Thank you. I'd like to start with a short story. It's about a little boy whose father was a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on the outskirts of their camp. They would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis  and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls  but at the same time they excited him. And the dad used to use those bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work. Let's fast forward to the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later  where I started a technology company that brought the world its first  D laser scanning system. Let me show you how it works. Female Voice  Long range laser scanning by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light. The system measures the beam's time of flight  recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return. With two mirrors  the scanner calculates the beam's horizontal and vertical angles  giving accurate x  y  and z coordinates. The point is then recorded into a  D visualization program. All of this happens in seconds. Ben Kacyra  You can see here  these systems are extremely fast. They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution. A surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard pressed to produce maybe     points in a whole day. These babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second. So  as you can imagine  this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry. Approximately ten years ago  my wife and I started a foundation to do good  and right about that time  the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas  hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan  were blown up by the Taliban. They were gone in an instant. And unfortunately  there was no detailed documentation of these Buddhas. This clearly devastated me  and I couldn't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends  the winged bulls  and the fate of the many  many heritage sites all over the world. Both my wife and I were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites. We called the project CyArk  which stands for Cyber Archive. To date  with the help of a global network of partners  we've completed close to fifty projects. Let me show you some of them  Chichen Itza  Rapa Nui    and what you're seeing here are the cloud of points    Babylon  Rosslyn Chapel  Pompeii  and our latest project  Mt. Rushmore  which happened to be one of our most challenging projects. As you see here  we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal. The results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers. We also produce media for dissemination to the public    free through the CyArk website. These would be used for education  cultural tourism  etc. What you're looking at in here is a  D viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of  the  cloud of points in real time  cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions. This happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal. In here you see a traditional  D architectural engineering drawing that's used for preservation  and of course we tell the stories through fly throughs. And here  this is a fly through the cloud of points of Tikal  and here you see it rendered and photo textured with the photography that we take of the site. And so this is not a video. This is actual  D points with two to three millimeter accuracy. And of course the data can be used to develop  D models that are very accurate and very detailed. And here you're looking at a model that's extracted from the cloud of points for Stirling Castle. It's used for studies  for visualization  as well as for education. And finally  we produce mobile apps that include narrated virtual tools. The more I got involved in the heritage field  the more it became clear to me that we are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them. Of course  earthquakes and all the natural phenomena    floods  tornadoes  etc.    take their toll. However  what occurred to me was human caused destruction  which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction  but actually it was accelerating. This includes arson  urban sprawl  acid rain  not to mention terrorism and wars. It was getting more and more apparent that we're fighting a losing battle. We're losing our sites and the stories  and basically we're losing a piece    and a significant piece    of our collective memory. Imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from. Luckily  in the last two or three decades  digital technologies have been developing that have helped us to develop tools that we've brought to bear in the digital preservation  in our digital preservation war. This includes  for example  the  D laser scanning systems  ever more powerful personal computers   D graphics  high definition digital photography  not to mention the Internet. Because of this accelerated pace of destruction  it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work. And we created a project we call the CyArk     Challenge    and that is to digitally preserve     World Heritage Sites in five years. We do have the technology that's scaleable  and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate  so we're comfortable that this task can be accomplished. However  to me  the     is really just the first    . In order to sustain our work into the future  we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them  whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites  and at the same time  it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future. Let me close with another short story. Two years ago  we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site  a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda  the Royal Kasubi Tombs. The work was done successfully in the field  and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the CyArk website. Last March  we received very sad news. The Royal Tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson. A few days later  we received a call   Is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction   Our answer  of course  was yes. Let me leave you with a final thought. Our heritage is much more than our collective memory    it's our collective treasure. We owe it to our children  our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well  I'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so  while I've been speaking  you have been scanned. The two wizards that I have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen. This is all in  D and of course you can fly through the cloud of points. You can look at it from on top  from the ceiling. You can look from different vantage points  but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in on an individual in the crowd  just to show the amount of detail that we can create. So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes. I'd like to thank the wizards here. We were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this  the Historic Scotland  and the Glasgow School of Art. I'd like to also thank personally the efforts of David Mitchell  who is the Director of Conservation at Historic Scotland. David. And Doug Pritchard  who's the Head of Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art. Let's give them a hand. Thank you. Humans have long held a fascination for the human brain. We chart it  we've described it  we've drawn it  we've mapped it. Now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology    think Google Maps  think GPS    the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation. So let's take a look at the brain. Most people  when they first look at a fresh human brain  they say   It doesn't look what you're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain.  Typically  what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray. And this outer layer  this is the vasculature  which is incredible  around a human brain. This is the blood vessels.    percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs     percent of the blood pumped from your heart  is servicing this one organ. That's basically  if you hold two fists together  it's just slightly larger than the two fists. Scientists  sort of at the end of the   th century  learned that they could track blood flow to map non invasively where activity was going on in the human brain. So for example  they can see in the back part of the brain  which is just turning around there. There's the cerebellum  that's keeping you upright right now. It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement. On the side here  this is temporal cortex. This is the area where primary auditory processing    so you're hearing my words  you're sending it up into higher language processing centers. Towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought  decision making    it's the last to mature in late adulthood. This is where all your decision making processes are going on. It's the place where you're deciding right now you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner. So if you take a deeper look at the brain  one of the things  if you look at it in cross section  what you can see is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there. But there's actually a lot of structure there. It's cells and it's wires all wired together. So about a hundred years ago  some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells. And that's shown here in the the very light blue. You can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained. And what you can see is it's very non uniform. You see a lot more structure there. So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex. It's one continuous processing unit  if you will. But you can also see things underneath there as well. And all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through. They're probably less cell dense. So there's about    billion neurons in our brain. And as you can see  they're very non uniformly distributed. And how they're distributed really contributes to their underlying function. And of course  as I mentioned before  since we can now start to map brain function  we can start to tie these into the individual cells. So let's take a deeper look. Let's look at neurons. So as I mentioned  there are    billion neurons. There are also these smaller cells as you'll see. These are support cells    astrocytes glia. And the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input. They're storing it  they're processing it. Each neuron is connected via synapses to up to        other neurons in your brain. And each neuron itself is largely unique. The unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry. These are proteins. They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement. They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with. And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do. So if we zoom in to an even deeper level  all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes. We each have    pairs of chromosomes. We get one from mom  one from dad. And on these chromosomes are roughly        genes. They're encoded in the DNA. And the nature of a given cell driving its underlying biochemistry is dictated by which of these        genes are turned on and at what level they're turned on. And so our project is seeking to look at this readout  understanding which of these        genes is turned on. So in order to undertake such a project  we obviously need brains. So we sent our lab technician out. We were seeking normal human brains. What we actually start with is a medical examiner's office. This a place where the dead are brought in. We are seeking normal human brains. There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains. We want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of    to     they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain  no history of psychiatric disease  no drugs on board    we do a toxicology workup. And we're very careful about the brains that we do take. We're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue  we can get consent to take the tissue within    hours of time of death. Because what we're trying to measure  the RNA    which is the readout from our genes    is very labile  and so we have to move very quickly. One side note on the collection of brains  because of the way that we collect  and because we require consent  we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains. Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life. And men are much more likely to have their significant other  spouse  give consent than the other way around. So the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what's called an MR. This is magnetic resonance imaging    MRI. It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data. So we collect this MR. And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map. The next thing we do is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging. This maps the large cabling in the brain. And again  you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways  if you will. The brain is removed from the skull  and then it's sliced into one centimeter slices. And those are frozen solid  and they're shipped to Seattle. And in Seattle  we take these    this is a whole human hemisphere    and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer. There's a blade here that's going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide. We're going to then apply one of those stains to it  and we scan it. And then what we get is our first mapping. So this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments. You could consider this state boundaries  if you will  those pretty broad outlines. From this  we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces  which then we can put on a smaller cryostat. And this is just showing this here    this frozen tissue  and it's being cut. This is    microns thin  so this is about a baby hair's width. And remember  it's frozen. And so you can see here  old fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied. We take a microscope slide. Then we very carefully melt onto the slide. This will then go onto a robot that's going to apply one of those stains to it. And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this. So again this is what they can see under the microscope. You can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places. And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments. And they can make basically what's a reference atlas. This is a more detailed map. Our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what's called laser scanning microdissection. So the technician takes the instructions. They scribe along a place there. And then the laser actually cuts. You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off. You can see on the microscope slide here  that's what's happening in real time. There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue. We take that tissue  we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology  and then we put a florescent tag on it. We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray. Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you  but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass. This has roughly        elements on it  so we repeatedly measure various genes of the        genes in the genome. And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it  we get a unique fingerprint  if you will  quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample. Now we do this over and over again  this process for any given brain. We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain. This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus. It's involved in learning and memory. And it contributes to about    samples of those thousand samples. So each sample gets us about        data points with repeat measurements  a thousand samples. So roughly  we have    million data points for a given human brain. We've done right now two human brains worth of data. We've put all of that together into one thing  and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like. It's basically a large data set of information that's all freely available to any scientist around the world. They don't even have to log in to come use this tool  mine this data  find interesting things out with this. So here's the modalities that we put together. You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before. Here's the MR. It provides the framework. There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn  it allows you to zoom in  it allows you to highlight individual structures. But most importantly  we're now mapping into this anatomic framework  which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on. So the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree. Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on. And each gene gives us a fingerprint. And remember that we've assayed all the        genes in the genome and have all of that data available. So what can scientists learn about this data  We're just starting to look at this data ourselves. There's some basic things that you would want to understand. Two great examples are drugs  Prozac and Wellbutrin. These are commonly prescribed antidepressants. Now remember  we're assaying genes. Genes send the instructions to make proteins. Proteins are targets for drugs. So drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off  etc. So if you want to understand the action of drugs  you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to  and also in the ways you don't want them to. In the side effect profile  etc.  you want to see where those genes are turned on. And for the first time  we can actually do that. We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too. So now we can look throughout the brain. We can see this unique fingerprint. And we get confirmation. We get confirmation that  indeed  the gene is turned on    for something like Prozac  in serotonergic structures  things that are already known be affected    but we also get to see the whole thing. We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before  and we see these genes turned on there. It's as interesting a side effect as it could be. One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can  because it's a pattern matching exercise  because there's unique fingerprint  we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint. So if you're in drug discovery  for example  you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize. Most of you are probably familiar with genome wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying   Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X.  And so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they're great. They analyze large populations. They look at their entire genomes  and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked causally to genes. But what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes. It tells you the what  but it doesn't tell you the where. And so it's very important for those researchers that we've created this resource. Now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity. They can start to look at common pathways    other things that they simply haven't been able to do before. So I think this audience in particular can understand the importance of individuality. And I think every human  we all have different genetic backgrounds  we all have lived separate lives. But the fact is our genomes are greater than    percent similar. We're similar at the genetic level. And what we're finding is actually  even at the brain biochemical level  we are quite similar. And so this shows it's not    percent  but it's roughly    percent correspondence at a reasonable cutoff  so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated. And then we find some outliers  some things that lie beyond the cloud. And those genes are interesting  but they're very subtle. So I think it's an important message to take home today that even though we celebrate all of our differences  we are quite similar even at the brain level. Now what do those differences look like  This is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were    and they're quite subtle. These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type. These are two genes that we found as good examples. One is called RELN    it's involved in early developmental cues. DISC  is a gene that's deleted in schizophrenia. These aren't schizophrenic individuals  but they do show some population variation. And so what you're looking at here in donor one and donor four  which are the exceptions to the other two  that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells. It's this dark purple precipitate within the cell that's telling us a gene is turned on there. Whether or not that's due to an individual's genetic background or their experiences  we don't know. Those kinds of studies require much larger populations. So I'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go. I think these resources are incredibly valuable. They give researchers a handle on where to go. But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point. We're certainly going to be looking at more. I'll just close by saying that the tools are there  and this is truly an unexplored  undiscovered continent. This is the new frontier  if you will. And so for those who are undaunted  but humbled by the complexity of the brain  the future awaits. Thanks. I started Improv Everywhere about    years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy. Because I was new to the city  I didn't have access to a stage  so I decided to create my own in public places. So the first project we're going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride. Now this took place in January of     . And this woman is the star of the video. She doesn't know she's being filmed. She's being filmed with a hidden camera. This is on the   train in New York City. And this is the first stop along the line. These are two Danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera. And that's me right there in a brown coat. It's about    degrees outside. I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf. And the girl's going to notice me right here. And as you'll see now  I'm not wearing pants. So at this point    at this point she's noticed me  but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car. One person's not that unusual. She goes back to reading her book  which is unfortunately titled  Rape.  So she's noticed the unusual thing  but she's gone back to her normal life. Now in the meantime  I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well. They're going to be entering this car one by one. We'll act as though we don't know each other. And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made  forgetting our pants on this cold January day. So at this point  she decides to put the rape book away. And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings. Now in the meantime  the two Danish guys to the left of the camera  they're cracking up. They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before. And watch her make eye contact with them right about now. And I love that moment in this video  because before it became a shared experience  it was something that was maybe a little bit scary  or something that was at least confusing to her. And then once it became a shared experience  it was funny and something that she could laugh at. So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the   line. So the video won't show everything. This goes on for another four stops. A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear. At the eighth stop  a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar    like you might sell batteries or candy on the train. We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants  put them on and said   Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today   and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions. Thank you. So that's a still from the video there. And I love that girl's reaction so much. And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do. And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people. It's a prank  but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell. And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride. And we've continued to do it every year. This January  we did the   th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of       people rode the train in their underwear in New York    almost every single train line in the city. And also in    other cities around the world  people participated. As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians  I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects. So I could do more large scale projects. Well one day I was walking through Union Square  and I saw this building  which had just been built in     . And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing. And it was very peculiar  because it was dark out  but she was back lit with florescent lighting  and she was very much onstage  and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it. After about    seconds  her friend appeared    she had been hiding behind a display    and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away. So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this. So I got inspired by that. Looking at the entire facade    there were    total windows    and I knew what I had to do. So this project is called Look Up More. We had    actors dress in black. This was completely unauthorized. We didn't let the stores know we were coming. And I stood in the park giving signals. The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four foot tall letters that spelled out  Look Up More   the name of the project. The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together. You'll see that start right here. And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance. And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them. So then I gave a new hand signal  which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever     and he danced. There were several other activities. We had people jumping up and down  people dropping to the ground. And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt  putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement. And because it was in Union Square Park  right by a subway station  there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing. There's a better photo of it. So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon. The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger. A high school kid in Texas wrote me in      and said   You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around.  So I wrote this high school kid back immediately  and I said   Yes  you are correct. I think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you.  So here's the video. So again  this is     . This is the Best Buy in New York City. We had about    people show up to participate  entering one by one. There was an eight year old girl  a    year old girl. There was also a    year old man who participated. So a very diverse group of people. And I told people   Don't work. Don't actually do work. But also  don't shop. Just stand around and don't face products.  Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt. Everybody else is one of our actors. The lower level employees thought it was very funny. And in fact  several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us. A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers. The managers and the security guards  on the other hand  did not find it particularly funny. You can see them in this footage. They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt. And we were there probably    minutes before the managers decided to dial    . So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming  watch out  the cops were coming. And you can see the cops in this footage right here. That's a cop wearing black right there  being filmed with a hidden camera. Ultimately  the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not  in fact  illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants. Thank you. So we had been there for    minutes  we were happy to exit the store. One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras. And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags. But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop. So I like that concept of using their own technology against them. I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason. And one morning  I was riding the subway. I had to make a transfer at the   rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators. And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning  it's very crowded. So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning. So this was in the winter of              in the morning. It's morning rush hour. It's very cold outside. People are coming in from Queens  transferring from the E train to the   train. And they're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs. Thank you. So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better. He gave       high fives that day  and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick. And that was done also without permission  although no one seemed to care. So I'd say over the years  one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is   These people have too much time on their hands.  And you know  not everybody's going to like everything you do  and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments  but that one's always bothered me  because we don't have too much time on our hands. The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers  they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way. You know  every Saturday and Sunday  hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games. And I've never seen anybody comment  looking at a football game  saying   All those people in the stands  they have too much time on their hands.  And of course they don't. It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon  watching a football game in a stadium. But I think it's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with     people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library. Or listening to the same MP  as       other people and dancing silently in a park  or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical  or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire. You know  as kids  we're taught to play. And we're never given a reason why we should play. It's just acceptable that play is a good thing. And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere. It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point. We don't need a reason. As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time  then that's enough for us. And I think  as adults  we need to learn that there's no right or wrong way to play. Thank you very much. I was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at Yale University in the department of medicine. And my job was to write many of the algorithms and code for NASA to do virtual surgery in preparation for the astronauts going into deep space flight  so they could be kept in robotic pods. One of the fascinating things about what we were working on is that we were seeing  using new scanning technologies  things that had never been seen before. Not only in disease management  but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you marvel. I remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen. And your entire body  everything    your hair  skin  bone  nails    everything is made of collagen. And it's a kind of rope like structure that twirls and swirls like this. And the only place that collagen changes its structure is in the cornea of your eye. In your eye  it becomes a grid formation  and therefore  it becomes transparent  as opposed to opaque. So perfectly organized a structure  it was hard not to attribute divinity to it. Because we kept on seeing this in different parts of the body. One of the opportunities I had was one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the NIH. And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these new technologies. So I wrote the algorithms and code  and he built the hardware    Paul Lauterbur    then went onto win the Nobel Prize for inventing the MRI. I got the data. And I'm going to show you a sample of the piece   From Conception to Birth.   From Conception to Birth   Oocyte   Sperm   Egg Inseminated      Hours  Baby's first division   The fertilized ovum divides a few hours after fusion...   And divides anew every    to    hours.   Early Embryo   Yolk sack still feeding baby.      Days  Heart chamber developing.      Days  Arms   hands are developing      Days  Beginning of the primitive vertebrae   These weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus.   If the fetus continues to grow at this speed for the entire   months  it would be  .  tons at birth.      Days   Embryo's heart is beating twice as fast as the mother's.      Days   Developing retina  nose and fingers   The fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth.      Weeks  Indifferent penis   Girl or boy yet to be determined     Months   Delivery  The expulsion stage   The moment of birth  Alexander Tsiaras  Thank you. But as you can see  when you actually start working on this data  it's pretty spectacular. And as we kept on scanning more and more  working on this project  looking at these two simple cells that have this unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you. And as we kept on working on this data  looking at small clusters of the body  these little pieces of tissue that were the trophoblasts coming off of the blastocyst  all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus  saying   I'm here to stay.  Having conversation and communications with the estrogens  the progesterones  saying   I'm here to stay  plant me   building this incredible trilinear fetus that becomes  within    days  something that you can recognize  and then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being. The marvel of this information  How do we actually have this biological mechanism inside our body to actually see this information  I'm going to show you something pretty unique. Here's a human heart at    days. It's just basically two strands. And like this magnificent origami  cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks  as it's just folding on itself. Within five weeks  you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles. Six weeks  these folds are now beginning with the papilla on the inside of the heart actually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart until you get a mature heart    and then basically the development of the entire human body. The magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure saying exactly where that nerve cell should go    the complexity of these  the mathematical models of how these things are indeed done are beyond human comprehension. Even though I am a mathematician  I look at this with marvel of how do these instruction sets not make these mistakes as they build what is us  It's a mystery  it's magic  it's divinity. Then you start to take a look at adult life. Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries. It's just a tiny sub substructure  microscopic. But basically by the time you're nine months and you're given birth  you have almost        miles of vessels inside your body. And only one mile is visible.        miles that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away. The complexity of building that within a single system is  again  beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today. And then instructions set  from the brain to every other part of the body    look at the complexity of the folding. Where does this intelligence of knowing that a fold can actually hold more information  so as you actually watch the baby's brain grow. And this is one of the things we're doing. We're launching two new studies of scanning babies' brains from the moment they're born. Every six months until they're six years old  we're going to be doing about     children  watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us. And it's not just our own existence  but how does the woman's body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own  but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological  cardiovascular system that basically is a mobile system that can actually nurture  treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond  again  our comprehension    the magic that is existence  that is us  Thank you.  music by Moby   Grand Canyon  Narrator  Many of the tests are conducted while Yves is strapped onto the wing  because Yves' body is an integral part of the aircraft.  Wind tunnel tests  Narrator  The wing has no steering controls  no flaps  no rudder. Yves uses his body to steer the wing. Stefan Von Bergen  Well  he turns by just putting his head on one or the other side. And sometimes he assists that with his hands  sometimes even with the leg. He's acting as a human fuselage  so to say. And that's quite unique. Narrator  When he arches his back  he gains altitude. When he pushes his shoulders forward  he goes into a dive.  Swiss Alps   Strait of Gibraltar crossing   English Channel crossing  Commentator One  There he goes. There is Yves Rossy. And I think the wing is open. So our first critical moment  it's open. He is down. Is he flying  Commentator Two  It looks like he's stabilized. He's starting to make his climb. Commentator One  There's that    degree turn. He's out over the channel. There is Yves Rossy. There is no turning back now. He is over the English Channel and under way. Ladies and gentlemen  a historic flight has begun.  Images  National Geographic  Commentator Two  And as he approaches the ground  he's going to pull down on those toggles to flare  slow himself down just a little bit  and then come in for a nice landing. Commentator One  There he is. Yves Rossy has landed in England. Bruno Giussani  And now he's in Edinburgh. Yves Rossy  And his equipment as well. Yves  welcome. It is quite amazing. Those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities. And there were many  many others. So it's possible to fly almost like a bird. What is it like to be up there  Yves Rossy  It's fun. It's fun. I don't have feathers. But I feel like a bird sometimes. It's really an unreal feeling  because normally you have a big thing  a plane  around you. And when I strap just this little harness  this little wing  I really have the feeling of being a bird. BG  How did you start to become Jetman  YR  It was about    years ago  when I discovered free falling. When you go out of an airplane  you are almost naked. You take a position like that. And especially when you take a tracking position  you have the feeling that you are flying. And that's the nearest thing to the dream. You have no machine around you. You are just in the element. It's very short and only in one direction. So the idea was  okay  keep that feeling of freedom  but change the vector and increase the time. BG  So I'm kind of curious  what's your top speed  YR  It's about     km per hour before looping. That means about     miles per hour. BG  What's the weight of the equipment you're carrying  YR  When I exit full of kerosene  I'm about    kilos. I have    kilos on my back. BG  And you're not piloting  There is no handle  no steering  nothing  It is purely your body  and the wings become part of the body and vice versa  YR  That's really the goal  because if you put in steering  then you reinvent the airplane. And I wanted to keep this freedom of movement. And it's really like the kid playing the airplane. I want to go down like that. And up I climb  I turn. It's really pure flying. It's not steering  it's flight. BG  What kind of training do you do  you personally  for that  YR  Actually  I try to stay just fit. I don't do special physical training. I just try to keep my mobility through new activities. For example  last winter I began with kite surfing. So  new things. So you have to adapt. I'm quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot  but this is  really    You need fluidity  you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast. BG  Somebody in the audience asked me   How does he breathe up there   Because you're going fast and you're up at       meters or so. YR  Okay  up to       meters  it's not such a big problem with oxygen. But for example  bikers  they have the same speed. Just with the helmet  integral helmet  it's really no problem to breathe. BG  Describe for me the equipment  since you have it here. So Breitling's four engines. YR  Yeah  two meter span. Ultra stable profile. Four little engines     kilos thrust each  turbines  working with kerosene. Harness  parachute. My only instruments are an altimeter and time. I know I have about eight minutes fuel. So I just check before it's finished. And yeah  that's all. Two parachutes. That means  if I have a problem with the first one I pull  I still have the possibility to open the second one. And this is my life. That's the real important thing about safety. I did use that during these last    years about    times. Never with that type of wing  but at the beginning. I can release my wing when I am in a spin or unstable. BG  We saw the      crossing of the Gibraltar Strait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean. So that was one of those cases where you let the wings go  right  YR  Yeah. I did try in the clouds  but you lose orientation completely. So I did try to take  again  a climb altitude. I thought  okay  I will go out. But most probably  I did something like that. BG  Something that is not very safe  the image. YR  You feel great  but    But you have not the right altitude. So the next thing I saw was just blue. It was the sea. I have also an audible altimeter. So I was at my minimum altitude in that vector    fast    so I pulled that. And then I did open my chute. BG  So the wings have their own parachute  and you have your two parachutes. YR  Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons  so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that  just on his head. BG  I see. Maybe come back here. This is risky stuff indeed. People have died trying to do this kind of thing. And you don't look like a crazy guy  you're a Swiss airline pilot  so you're rather a checklist kind of guy. I assume you have standards. YR  Yeah. I have no checklist for that. BG  Let's not tell your employer. YR  No  that's really two worlds. Civil aviation is something that we know very well. We have a hundred years of experience. And you can adapt really precisely. With that  I have to adapt to something new. That means improvise. So it's really a play between these two approaches. Something that I know very well  these principles. For example  we have two engines on an Airbus  with only one engine  you can fly it. So plan B  always a plan B. In a fighter  you have an ejection seat. That's my ejection seat. So I have the approach of a professional pilot with the respect of a pioneer in front of Mother Nature. BG  It's well said. What happens if one of the engines stops  YR  I do a roll. And then I stabilize  and according to my altitude  I continue on two or three engines. It's sometimes possible. It's quite complicated to explain  but according to which regime I was  I can continue on two and try to get a nice place to land  and then I open my parachute. BG  So the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter  and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines  and then you basically take off mid air somewhere. And then the landing  as we have seen  arriving on this side of the Channel  is through a parachute. So just as a curiosity  where did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon  Did you land on the rim  down at the bottom  YR  It was down on the bottom. And I came back afterward on the sled of the helicopter back. But it was too stony and full of cactus on top. BG  That's exactly why I asked the question. YR  And also  the currents are quite funny there. There is big thermal activity  big difference in altitude also. So it was much safer for me to land at the bottom. BG  I think that right now  many people are asking   When are you developing a double seater so they can fly with you   YR  I have a standard answer. Have you ever seen tandem birds  BG  Perfect answer. BG  Yves  one last question. What's next for you  What's next for Jetman  YR  First  to instruct a younger guy. I want to share it  to do formation flights. And I plan to start from a cliff  like catapulted from a cliff. BG  So instead of jumping off a plane  yes  YR  Yes  with the final goal to take off  but with initial speed. Really  I go step by step. It seems a little bit crazy  but it's not. It's possible to start already now  it's just too dangerous. Thanks to the increasing technology  better technology  it will be safe. And I hope it will be for everybody. BG  Yves  thank you very much. Yves Rossy. I've always had a fascination for computers and technology  and I made a few apps for the iPhone  iPod Touch  and iPad. I'd like to share a couple with you today. My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was. My favorite and most successful app is Bustin Jieber  which is      Laughter      which is a Justin Bieber Whac A Mole. I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit  so I decided to make the app. So I went to work programming it  and I released it just before the holidays in     . A lot of people ask me  how did I make these  A lot of times it's because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also. A lot of kids these days like to play games  but now they want to make them  and it's difficult  because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program. I mean  for soccer  you could go to a soccer team. For violin  you could get lessons for a violin. But what if you want to make an app  And their parents  the kid's parents might have done some of these things when they were young  but not many parents have written apps.  Laughter  Where do you go to find out how to make an app  Well  this is how I approached it. This is what I did. First of all  I've been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down  such as Python  C  Java  etc. And then Apple released the iPhone  and with it  the iPhone software development kit  and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app. This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me  and after playing with the software development kit a little bit  I made a couple apps  I made some test apps. One of them happened to be Earth Fortune  and I was ready to put Earth Fortune on the App Store  and so I persuaded my parents to pay the    dollar fee to be able to put my apps on the App Store. They agreed  and now I have apps on the App Store. I've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family  friends  teachers and even people at the Apple Store  and that's been a huge help to me. I've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs  and I've started an app club at school  and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club. Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app. This is so I can share my experiences with others. There's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program  and some districts have them. I'm fortunate enough to be part of one. A big challenge is  how should the iPads be used  and what apps should we put on the iPads  So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like. When we design the app and we sell it  it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to  all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations. These days  students usually know a little bit more than teachers with the technology.  Laughter  So     Laughter     sorry     Laughter     so this is a resource to teachers  and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it. I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future. First of all  I'd like to create more apps  more games. I'm working with a third party company to make an app. I'd like to get into Android programming and development  and I'd like to continue my app club  and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others. Thank you.  Applause  Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging  This is a dream of the ages. But scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible. They thought you just wear out  there's nothing you can do about it    kind of like an old shoe. But if you look in nature  you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans. Now these animals are different from one another  because they have different genes. So that suggests that somewhere in these genes  somewhere in the DNA  are genes for aging  genes that allow them to have different lifespans. So if there are genes like that  then you can imagine that  if you could change one of the genes in an experiment  an aging gene  maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan. And if you could do that  then you could find the genes for aging. And if they exist and you can find them  then maybe one could eventually do something about it. So we've set out to look for genes that control aging. And we didn't study any of these animals. Instead  we studied a little  tiny  round worm called C. elegans  which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence. And we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long lived mutant. So we started to change genes at random  looking for long lived animals. And we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf   doubled the lifespan of the little worm. So you can see in black  after a month    they're very short lived  that's why we like to study them for studies of aging    in black  after a month  the normal worms are all dead. But at that time  most of the mutant worms are still alive. And it isn't until twice as long that they're all dead. And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here. So the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about college student age    a young adult. It's quite a cute little fellow. And next you're going to see the long lived mutant when it's young. So this animal is going to live twice as long. Is it miserable  It doesn't seem to be. It's active. You can't tell the difference really. And they can be completely fertile    have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do. Now get out your handkerchiefs here. You're going to see  in just two weeks  the normal worms are old. You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there. But everything else is just lying there. The animal's clearly in the nursing home. And if you look at the tissues of the animal  they're starting to deteriorate. You know  even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans    which probably most of you haven't seen one    you can tell they're old    isn't that interesting  So there's something about aging that's kind of universal. And now here is the daf   mutant. One gene is changed out of         and look at it. It's the same age  but it's not in the nursing home  it's going skiing. This is what's really cool  it's aging more slowly. It takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day. And when I tell people about this  they tend to think of maybe an    or    year old person who looks really good for being    or   . But it's really more like this  let's say you're a    year old guy    or in your   s    and you're a bachelor and you're dating people. And you meet someone you really like  you get to know her. And you're in a restaurant  and you say   Well how old are you   She says   I'm   .  That's what it's like. And you would never know. You would never know  until she told you. Okay. So what is the daf   gene  Well as you know  genes  which are part of the DNA  they're instructions to make a protein that does something. And the daf   gene encodes a hormone receptor. So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell. So part of it is like a baseball glove. Part of it's on the outside  and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green. And the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell. Okay  so what is the daf   receptor telling the inside of the cell  I just told you that  if you make a mutation in the daf   gene cell  that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well  the animal lives longer. So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging. That's what that arrow means. It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster. So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself  speeding up aging. So this is altogether really  really interesting. It says that aging is subject to control by the genes  and specifically by hormones. So what kind of hormones are these  There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone  adrenalin. You know about a lot of them. These hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies. The daf   hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and IGF  . Now you've all heard of at least insulin. Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal. And the hormone IGF   promotes growth. So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time  but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about    maybe they also affect aging. And it's looking like that's the case. So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans  people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking  if we made the same daf   mutation  the hormone receptor mutation  in other animals  will they live longer  And that is the case in flies. If you change this hormone pathway in flies  they live longer. And also in mice    and mice are mammals like us. So it's an ancient pathway  because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals. And also  the common precursor also gave rise to people. So maybe it's working in people the same way. And there are hints of this. So for example  there was one study that was done in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City. And just like any population  most of the people live to be about    or     but some live to be    or    . And what they found was that people who lived to    or     were more likely to have daf   mutations    that is  changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for IGF  . And these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted. It damaged the gene. So those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones for aging. So the next question  of course  is  Is there any effect on age related disease  As you age  you're much more likely to get cancer  Alzheimer's disease  heart disease  all sorts of diseases. It turns out that these long lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases. They hardly get cancer  and when they do it's not as severe. So it's really interesting  and it makes sense in a way  that they're still young  so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old  So it suggests that  if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans  maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age related diseases all at once. So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging  How could that work  Well it turns out that in the daf   mutants  a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues  and repair damage. And the way that they're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO. So in a daf   mutant    you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor. The receptor isn't working as well. Under those conditions  the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus    that little compartment there in the middle of the cell    and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it. You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO. And it's just sitting on one of them. So FOXO turns on a lot of genes. And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes  genes I call carrot giver genes  whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well    to fold correctly and function correctly. And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they're damaged. DNA repair genes are more active in these animals. And the immune system is more active. And many of these different genes  we've shown  actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf   mutant. So it's really interesting. These animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do. They have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage  which we think makes them live longer. So what about the normal worm  Well when the daf   receptor is active  then it triggers a series of events that prevent FOXO from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is. So it can't turn the genes on. That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan  until we have the daf   mutant. But what good is this for the worm  Well we think that insulin and IGF   hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions    in the good times    when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment. Then they promote the uptake of nutrients. You can store the food  use it for energy  grow  etc. But what we think is that  under conditions of stress  the levels of these hormones drop    for example  having limited food supply. And that  we think  is registered by the animal as a danger signal  a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity. So it activates FOXO  FOXO goes to the DNA  and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself. And that's why we think the animals live longer. So you can think of FOXO as being like a building superintendent. So maybe he's a little bit lazy  but he's there  he's taking care of the building. But it's deteriorating. And then suddenly  he learns that there's going to be a hurricane. So he doesn't actually do anything himself. He gets on the telephone    just like FOXO gets on the DNA    and he calls up the roofer  the window person  the painter  the floor person. And they all come and they fortify the house. And then the hurricane comes through  and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in. And not only that  it can also just last longer  even if there isn't a hurricane. So that's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists. Now the really cool thing about FOXO is that there are different forms of it. We all have FOXO genes  but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene. Just like we all have eyes  but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes. And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be    or    . And that's the case all over the world  as you can see from these stars. And each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked   Okay  are there differences in the type of FOXO genes among people who live a really long time   and there are. We don't know the details of how this works  but we do know then that FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people. And that means that  maybe if we tweak it a little bit  we can increase the health and longevity of people. So this is really exciting to me. A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little  round worms to affect lifespan  and here it affects lifespan in people. So we've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this FOXO cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age related diseases. And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work. There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging. And for at least one of them  there is a drug. There's one called TOR  which is another nutrient sensor  like the insulin pathway. And mutations that damage the TOR gene    just like the daf   mutations    extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice. But in this case  there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity. And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse    even when it's pretty old  like age    for a human  that old for a mouse    if you give the mouse rapamycin  it will live longer. Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin. It is a drug for people  but the reason is it suppresses the immune system. So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected. So this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer. But still  here in the year       there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan  which comes out of this science that's been done in all these different animals. So I'm really optimistic  and I think it won't be too long  I hope  before this age old dream begins to come true. Thank you. Matt Ridley  Thank you  Cynthia. Let me get this straight. Although you're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me  what you could do now pretty well in the lab  if you were allowed ethically  is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer  CK  Ah  so the kinds of drugs I was talking about would not change the genes  they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity. So if you stop taking the drug  the protein would go back to normal. You could change the genes in principle. There isn't the technology to do that. But I don't think that's a good idea. And the reason is that these hormones  like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway  they're essential. If you knock them out completely  then you're very sick. So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems. And I think that's much better  that kind of control would be much better as a drug. And also  there are other ways of activating FOXO that don't even involve insulin or IGF   that might even be safer. MR  I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it  but ... There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about  which is a negligible senescence. There are some creatures on this planet already that don't really do aging. Just move to one side for us  if you would. CK  There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age. For example  there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles. And they grow to be about this size. And they've been tagged  and they've been found to be    years old. And when you look at these    year old turtles  you can't tell the difference  just by looking  between those turtles and    year old turtles. And the    year old ones  actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places  and they also have more progeny every year. And there are other examples of these kinds of animals  like turns  certain kinds of birds are like this. And nobody knows if they really can live forever  or what keeps them from aging. It's not clear. If you look at birds  which live a long time  cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide  things like that. And our long lived mutants are too. They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses. So it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about  which are set to run really quickly in the worm  have a different normal set point in something like a bird  so that a bird can live a lot longer. And maybe they're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all    but we don't know. MR  But what you're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death  so much as extending human youthspan. CK  Yes  that's right. It's more like  say  if you were a dog. You notice that you're getting old  and you look at your human and you think   Why isn't this human getting old   They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan. It's more like that. But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human. MR  Thank you very much indeed  Cynthia Kenyon. I'd like to apologize  first of all  to all of you because I have no form of PowerPoint presentation. So what I'm going to do is  every now and again  I will make this gesture  and in a moment of PowerPoint democracy  you can imagine what you'd like to see. I do a radio show. The radio show is called  The Infinite Monkey Cage.  It's about science  it's about rationalism. So therefore  we get a lot of complaints every single week    complaints including one we get very often  which is to say the very title   Infinite Monkey Cage   celebrates the idea of vivisection. We have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy. We also had someone else who said   'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous. An infinite number of monkeys could never write the works of Shakespeare. We know this because they did an experiment.  Yes  they gave    monkeys a typewriter for a week  and after a week  they only used it as a bathroom. So the main element though  the main complaint we get    and one that I find most worrying    is that people say   Oh  why do you insist on ruining the magic  You bring in science  and it ruins the magic.  Now I'm an arts graduate  I love myth and magic and existentialism and self loathing. That's what I do. But I also don't understand how it does ruin the magic. All of the magic  I think  that may well be taken away by science is then replaced by something as wonderful. Astrology  for instance  like many rationalists  I'm a Pisces. Now astrology    we remove the banal idea that your life could be predicted  that you'll  perhaps today  meet a lucky man who's wearing a hat. That is gone. But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions  we still can. We can see predictions of galaxies forming  of galaxies colliding into each other  of new solar systems. This is a wonderful thing. If the Sun could one day    and indeed the Earth  in fact    if the Earth could read its own astrological  astronomical chart  one day it would say   Not a good day for making plans. You'll been engulfed by a red giant.  And that to me as well  that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds  well Many Worlds theory    one of the most beautiful  fascinating  sometimes terrifying ideas from the quantum interpretation    is a wonderful thing. That every person here  every decision that you've made today  every decision you've made in your life  you've not really made that decision  but in fact  every single permutation of those decisions is made  each one going off into a new universe. That is a wonderful idea. If you ever think that your life is rubbish  always remember there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that. If you ever think   Ah  I want to end it all   don't end it all. Remember that in the majority of universes  you don't even exist in the first place. This to me  in its own strange way  is very  very comforting. Now reincarnation  that's another thing gone    the afterlife. But it's not gone. Science actually says we will live forever. Well  there is one proviso. We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever. Your consciousness  the you ness of you  the me ness of me    that gets this one go. But every single thing that makes us  every atom in us  has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things. We have been mountains and apples and pulsars and other people's knees. Who knows  maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee. That is a good thing. Unlike the occupants of the universe  the universe itself is not wasteful. We are all totally recyclable. And when we die  we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs. This is a wonderful thing. Understanding  to me  does not remove the wonder and the joy. For instance  my wife could turn to me and she may say   Why do you love me   And I can with all honesty look her in the eye and say   Because our pheromones matched our olfactory receptors.  Though I'll probably also say something about her hair and personality as well. And that is a wonderful thing there. Love does not die because of that thing. Pain doesn't go away either. This is a terrible thing  even though I understand pain. If someone punches me    and because of my personality  this is recently a regular occurrence    I understand where the pain comes from. It is basically momentum to energy where the four vector is constant    that's what it is. But at no point can I react and go   Ha  Is that the best momentum to energy fourth vector constant you've got   No  I just spit out a tooth. And that is all of these different things    the love for my child. I have a son. His name is Archie. I'm very lucky  because he's better than all the other children. Now I know you don't think that. You may well have your own children and think   Oh no  my child's best.  That's the wonderful thing about evolution    the predilection to believe that our child is best. Now in many ways  that's just a survival thing. The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes  and therefore we love it. But we don't notice that bit  we just unconditionally love. That is a wonderful thing. Though I should say that my son is best and is better than your children. I've done some tests. And all of these things to me give such joy and excitement and wonder. Even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework  for instance. Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own. You house is in a terrible state. Your partner is about to return. You think  what should I do  Do nothing. All you have to do is  when she walks in  using a quantum interpretation  say   I'm so sorry. I stopped observing the house for a moment  and when I started observing again  everything had happened.  That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming. For me  it's a very  very important thing. Even on my journey up here    the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time. If you actually think  you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful. I'm sitting on a train. Every time I breathe in  I'm breathing in a million billion billion atoms of oxygen. I'm sitting on a chair. Even though I know the chair is made of atoms and therefore actually in many ways empty space  I find it comfortable. I look out the window  and I realize that every single time we stop and I look out that window  framed in that window  wherever we are  I am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet Earth. If you go to the safari parks on Saturn or Jupiter  you will be disappointed. And I realize I'm observing this with the brain  the human brain  the most complex thing in the known universe. That  to me  is an incredible thing. And do you know what  that might be enough. Steven Weinberg  the Nobel laureate  once said   The more the universe seems comprehensible  the more it seems pointless.  Now for some people  that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism. But for me  it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing. I'm glad the universe is pointless. It means if I get to the end of my life  the universe can't turn to me and go   What have you been doing  you idiot  That's not the point.  I can make my own purpose. You can make your own purpose. We have the individual power to go   This is what I want to do.  And in a pointless universe  that  to me  is a wonderful thing. I have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation. You  I imagine  can do much better things with your time. Thank you very much. Goodbye. I want to talk to you about something kind of big. We'll start here.    million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day. A chunk of rock six miles across  moving something like    times the speed of a rifle bullet  slammed into the Earth. It released its energy all at once  and it was an explosion that was mind numbing. If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War  lumped them together and blew them up at the same time  that would be one one millionth of the energy released at that moment. The dinosaurs had a really bad day. Okay  Now  a six mile wide rock is very large. We all live here in Boulder. If you look out your window and you can see Long's Peak  you're probably familiar with it. Now  scoop up Long's Peak  and put it out in space. Take Meeker  Mt. Meeker. Lump that in there  and put that in space as well  and Mt. Everest  and K   and the Indian peaks. Then you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about  okay  We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left. It hit in what we now know as Yucatan  the Gulf of Mexico. You can see here  there's the Yucatan Peninsula  if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there. Here is how big of a crater was left. It was huge. To give you a sense of the scale  okay  there you go. The scale here is    miles on top  a hundred kilometers on the bottom. This thing was     kilometers across        miles    an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet  threw up enough dust to block out the sun. It wiped out    percent of all species on Earth. Now  not all asteroids are that big. Some of them are smaller. Here is one that came in over the United States in October of     . It came in on a Friday night. Why is that important  Because back then  video cameras were just starting to become popular  and people would bring them  parents would bring them  to their kids' football games to film their kids play football. And since this came in on a Friday  they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina  Maryland  Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York. Now  this is not a     mile wide crater  but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here  about the size of a football  that hit that car and did that damage. Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in. It broke up through atmospheric pressure  it crumbled  and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage. Now  you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head  because it would do that to it. That would be bad. But it won't wipe out  you know  all life on Earth  so that's fine. But it turns out  you don't need something six miles across to do a lot of damage. There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock  and in fact  if any of you have ever been to near Winslow  Arizona  there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater. To give you a sense of scale  this is about a mile wide. If you look up at the top  that's a parking lot  and those are recreational vehicles right there. So it's about a mile across      feet deep. The object that formed this was probably about    to    yards across  so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here. It came in at speeds that were tremendous  slammed into the ground  blew up  and exploded with the energy of roughly a    megaton nuclear bomb    a very hefty bomb. This was        years ago  so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope  or something like that out in the desert  but it probably would not have caused global devastation. It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage. Now  in       over Siberia  near the Tunguska region    for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw  Ghostbusters   when he talked about the greatest cross dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of       where he got the date wrong  but that's okay.  Laughter  It was     . That's fine. I can live with that. Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground  several miles up above the surface of the Earth. The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it  and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles  okay  This did a huge amount of damage. And again  this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in. In Meteor Crater it was made of metal  and metal is much tougher  so it made it to the ground. The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock  and that's much more crumbly  so it blew up in the air. Either way  these are tremendous explosions     megatons. Now  when these things blow up  they're not going to do global ecological damage. They're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did. They're just not big enough. But they will do global economic damage  because they don't have to hit  necessarily  to do this kind of damage. They don't have to do global devastation. If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere  it would cause a panic. But if it came over a city  an important city    not that any city is more important than others  but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis    that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization. So  now that I've scared the crap out of you ... what can we do about this  All right  This is a potential threat. Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer for    million years. They're very rare. The smaller ones happen more often  but probably on the order of a millennium  every few centuries or every few thousand years  but it's still something to be aware of. Well  what do we do about them  The first thing we have to do is find them. This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in     . It's right here. But you can see that it's extremely faint. I don't even know if you can see that in the back row. These are just stars. This is a rock that was about    yards across  so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona        years ago. These things are faint. They're hard to see  and the sky is really big. We have to find these things first. Well the good news is  we're looking for them. NASA has devoted money to this. The National Science Foundation  other countries are very interested in doing this. We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat. That's a great first step  but what's the second step  The second step is that we see one heading toward us  we have to stop it. What do we do  You've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis. If you haven't yet  you will. If you've heard about the Mayan      apocalypse  you're going to hear about Apophis  because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway. Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in     . It's roughly     yards across  so it's pretty big    big size  you know  bigger than a football stadium    and it's going to pass by the Earth in April of     . And it's going to pass us so close that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites. The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it's just right  if it passes through this region of space  this kidney bean shaped region called the keyhole  the Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on April     which is a Friday  I'll note  in the year      ...  Laughter     you can't plan that kind of stuff    Apophis is going to hit us. And it's     meters across  so it would do unbelievable damage. Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go around are one in a million  roughly    very  very low odds  so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all. I don't think Apophis is a problem. In fact  Apophis is a blessing in disguise  because it woke us up to the dangers of these things. This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now. It won't  but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids. We didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes  and now we do and it turns out that's really important  because how do you stop an asteroid like this  Well  let me ask you  what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you  What do you do  You do this. Right  Move. The car goes past you. But we can't move the Earth  at least not easily  but we can move a small asteroid. And it turns out  we've even done it. In the year       NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact  which slammed into    slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet. Comets are very much like asteroids. The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way. The purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet  which we learned quite a bit about. We did move the comet a little tiny bit  not very much  but that wasn't the point. However  think about this. This thing is orbiting the sun at    miles per second     miles per second. We shot a space probe at it and hit it. Okay  Imagine how hard that must be  and we did it. That means we can do it again. If we need  if we see an asteroid that's coming toward us  and it's headed right for us  and we have two years to go  boom  We hit it. You can try to    you know  if you watch the movies  you might think about  why don't we use a nuclear weapon  It's like  well  you can try that  but the problem is timing. You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing  you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you'll just miss it. And there are a lot of other problems with that. It's very hard to do. But just hitting something  That's pretty easy. I think even NASA can do that  and they proved that they can.  Laughter  The problem is  what happens if you hit this asteroid  you've changed the orbit  you measure the orbit and then you find out  oh  yeah  we just pushed it into a keyhole  and now it's going to hit us in three years. Well  my opinion is  fine. Okay  It's not hitting us in six months. That's good. Now we have three years to do something else. And you can hit it again. That's kind of ham fisted. You might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever  so you don't do that. And this is the part  it's the part I just love. After the big macho  Rrrrrrr BAM  We're gonna hit this thing in the face   then we bring in the velvet gloves. There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B    Foundation. For those of you who've read  The Little Prince   you understand that reference  I hope. The little prince who lived on an asteroid  it was called B   . These are smart guys    men and women    astronauts  like I said  engineers. Rusty Schweickart  who was an Apollo   astronaut  is on this. Dan Durda  my friend who made this image  works here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder  on Walnut Street. He created this image for this  and he's actually one of the astronomers who works for them. If we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth and we have enough time  we can hit it to move it into a better orbit. But then what we do is we launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two. It doesn't have to be huge    couple of tons  not that big    and you park it near the asteroid. You don't land on it  because these things are tumbling end over end. It's very hard to land on them. Instead you get near it. The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe  and the probe has a couple of tons of mass. It has a little tiny bit of gravity  but it's enough that it can pull the asteroid  and you have your rockets set up  so you can    oh  you can barely see it here  but there's rocket plumes    and you basically  these guys are connected by their own gravity  and if you move the probe very slowly  very  very gently  you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit. You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it  although that's a whole other thing. I won't go into that. But we'd be rich  So think about this  right  There are these giant rocks flying out there  and they're hitting us  and they're doing damage to us  but we've figured out how to do this  and all the pieces are in place to do this. We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them. We have smart people  very  very smart people  who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem  and we have the technology to do this. This probe actually can't use chemical rockets. Chemical rockets provide too much thrust  too much push. The probe would just shoot away. We invented something called an ion drive  which is a very  very  very low thrust engine. It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand  incredibly light  but it can run for months and years  providing that very gentle push. If anybody here is a fan of the original  Star Trek   they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive  and Spock said   They're very technically sophisticated. They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive.  Yeah  we have an ion drive now.  Laughter  We don't have the Enterprise  but we've got an ion drive now. Spock. So ... that's the difference  that's the difference between us and the dinosaurs. This happened to them. It doesn't have to happen to us. The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote  and so we can change our future. We have the ability to change our future.    million years from now  we don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum. Thank you very much. Let me introduce to you Rezero. This little fellow was developed by a group of    undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH Zurich. Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots. Instead of wheels  a Ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball. The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground. This means that the robot is inherently unstable. It's like when I am trying to stand on one foot. You might ask yourself  what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable  Now we'll explain that in a second. Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance. Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor. He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately. This happens     times per second  and if anything fails in this process  Rezero would immediately fall to the ground. Now to move and to balance  Rezero needs to turn the ball. The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time. Due to his instability  Rezero is always in motion. Now here's the trick. It's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very  dynamically . Let's play a little. You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push. In this mode  he's trying to maintain his position. For the next demo  I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael  on the computer  and Thomas who's helping me onstage. In the next mode  Rezero is passive  and we can move him around. With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity. I can also make him spin. In the next mode  we can get Rezero to follow a person. He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas. This works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of Rezero. With the same method  we can also get him to circle a person. We call this the orbiting mode. All right  thank you  Thomas. Now  what's the use of this technology  For now  it's an experiment  but let me show you some possible future applications. Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks. With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way. In a hospital  this device could be used to carry around medical equipment. Due to the Ballbot system  it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around. And of course  who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these. And these are more practical applications. But there's also a certain beauty within this technology. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen  gather around. I would love to share with you a story. Once upon a time in   th century Germany  there was the book. Now during this time  the book was the king of storytelling. It was venerable. It was ubiquitous. But it was a little bit boring. Because in its     years of existence  storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device. But then one author arrived  and he changed the game forever. His name was Lothar  Lothar Meggendorfer. Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down  and he said   Genug ist genug   He grabbed his pen  he snatched his scissors. This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold. History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as    who else     the world's first true inventor of the children's pop up book. For this delight and for this wonder  people rejoiced. They were happy because the story survived  and that the world would keep on spinning. Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told  and he certainly wasn't the last. Whether storytellers realized it or not  they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville  radio news to radio theater  film to film in motion to film in sound  color   D  on VHS and on DVD. There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis. And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around. Because  not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world  but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices. For example  one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine. One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in  D. And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate. And after all this  everyone paused  they took a step back. They realized that  in       years of storytelling  they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls. And this was a cause for celebration. The art of storytelling has remained unchanged. And for the most part  the stories are recycled. But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure  consistent novelty. And they remembered a man  one amazing German  every time a new storytelling device popped up next. And for that  the audience    the lovely  beautiful audience    would live happily ever after. I  like many of you  am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities. And there are days    I don't know about the rest of you guys    but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life. And some days  that can even be a little scary. But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues  if we apply open source collaboration. A couple of years ago  I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment. Now at the time that I was reading this  it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment. So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future. But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article    was it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system. So  I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space. And you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high quality liquid soil over plants' root systems. Now to a vegetable plant  my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space. But I can offer some natural light and year round climate control. Fast forward two years later  we now have window farms  which are vertical  hydroponic platforms for food growing indoors. And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom  which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top  which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets    so there's no dirt involved. Now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate  so a window farm requires a farmer  and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm  and whether she is going to feed her food organically. Back at the time  a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing. And I really wanted it to be an open project  because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now and could possibly become another area like Monsanto  where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food. So I decided that  instead of creating a product  what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co developers. The first few systems that we created  they kind of worked. We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window. And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers  all kinds of stuff. But the first few systems were these leaky  loud power guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved. So to bring on more co developers  what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs  we explained how they worked  and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems. And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us. So actually now on this website  we have        people. And we have window farms all over the world. What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R D  or research and development. But what we call it is R D I Y  or research and develop it yourself. So for example  Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps. It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right  but once we did  we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half. Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments  like lots of other window farmers  and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients. And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project. So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software. And with every open source project  the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns. So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone. And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers. So for do it yourselfers  we provide free  very well tested instructions so that anyone  anywhere around the world  can build one of these systems for free. And there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community. And to fund the project  we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don't have time to build their own systems. Now within our community  a certain culture has appeared. In our culture  it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy. What we get out of this project is we get support for our own work  as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs. But I think that Eileen expresses best what we really get out of this  which is the actual joy of collaboration. So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea  built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing. If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people  maybe we just need to ditch the term  consumer  and get behind the people who are doing stuff. Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own. And what we're seeing is that R D I Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems. And we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us. And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now. So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united  and to declare that we are all still pioneers. If your life were a book and you were the author  how would you want your story to go  That's the question that changed my life forever. Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert  all I wanted was to be free. I would daydream about traveling the world  living in a place where it snowed  and I would picture all of the stories that I would go on to tell. At the age of     the day after I graduated high school  I moved to a place where it snowed and I became a massage therapist. With this job all I needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and I could go anywhere. For the first time in my life  I felt free  independent and completely in control of my life. That is  until my life took a detour. I went home from work early one day with what I thought was the flu  and less than    hours later I was in the hospital on life support with less than a two percent chance of living. It wasn't until days later as I lay in a coma that the doctors diagnosed me with bacterial meningitis  a vaccine preventable blood infection. Over the course of two and a half months I lost my spleen  my kidneys  the hearing in my left ear and both of my legs below the knee. When my parents wheeled me out of the hospital I felt like I had been pieced back together like a patchwork doll. I thought the worst was over until weeks later when I saw my new legs for the first time. The calves were bulky blocks of metal with pipes bolted together for the ankles and a yellow rubber foot with a raised rubber line from the toe to the ankle to look like a vein. I didn't know what to expect  but I wasn't expecting that. With my mom by my side and tears streaming down our faces  I strapped on these chunky legs and I stood up. They were so painful and so confining that all I could think was  how am I ever going to travel the world in these things  How was I ever going to live the life full of adventure and stories  as I always wanted  And how was I going to snowboard again  That day  I went home  I crawled into bed and this is what my life looked like for the next few months  me passed out  escaping from reality  with my legs resting by my side. I was absolutely physically and emotionally broken. But I knew that in order to move forward  I had to let go of the old Amy and learn to embrace the new Amy. And that is when it dawned on me that I didn't have to be five foot five anymore. I could be as tall as I wanted  Or as short as I wanted  depending on who I was dating. And if I snowboarded again  my feet aren't going to get cold. And best of all  I thought  I can make my feet the size of all the shoes that are on the sales rack.  Laughter  And I did  So there were benefits here. It was this moment that I asked myself that life defining question  If my life were a book and I were the author  how would I want the story to go  And I began to daydream. I daydreamed like I did as a little girl and I imagined myself walking gracefully  helping other people through my journey and snowboarding again. And I didn't just see myself carving down a mountain of powder  I could actually feel it. I could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment. And that is when a new chapter in my life began. Four months later I was back up on a snowboard  although things didn't go quite as expected  My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend and at one point I traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when I fell and my legs  still attached to my snowboard   went flying down the mountain  and I was on top of the mountain still. I was so shocked  I was just as shocked as everybody else  and I was so discouraged  but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet that I would be able to do this again. And this is when I learned that our borders and our obstacles can only do two things  one  stop us in our tracks or two  force us to get creative. I did a year of research  still couldn't figure out what kind of legs to use  couldn't find any resources that could help me. So I decided to make a pair myself. My leg maker and I put random parts together and we made a pair of feet that I could snowboard in. As you can see  rusted bolts  rubber  wood and neon pink duct tape. And yes  I can change my toenail polish. It was these legs and the best   st birthday gift I could ever receive   a new kidney from my dad   that allowed me to follow my dreams again. I started snowboarding  then I went back to work  then I went back to school. Then in      I cofounded a nonprofit organization for youth and young adults with physical disabilities so they could get involved with action sports. From there  I had the opportunity to go to South Africa  where I helped to put shoes on thousands of children's feet so they could attend school. And just this past February  I won two back to back World Cup gold medals   which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world. Eleven years ago  when I lost my legs  I had no idea what to expect. But if you ask me today  if I would ever want to change my situation  I would have to say no. Because my legs haven't disabled me  if anything they've enabled me. They've forced me to rely on my imagination and to believe in the possibilities  and that's why I believe that our imaginations can be used as tools for breaking through borders  because in our minds  we can do anything and we can be anything. It's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head on that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits. And although today is about innovation without borders  I have to say that in my life  innovation has only been possible because of my borders. I've learned that borders are where the actual ends  but also where the imagination and the story begins. So the thought that I would like  to challenge you with today is that maybe instead of looking at  our challenges and our limitations as something negative or bad  we can begin to look at them as blessings  magnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations and help us go further than we ever knew we could go. It's not about breaking down borders. It's about pushing off of them and seeing what amazing places they might bring us. Thank you. Meet Tony. He's my student. He's about my age  and he's in San Quentin State Prison. When Tony was    years old  one day  one moment   It was mom's gun. Just flash it  scare the guy. He's a punk. He took some money  we'll take his money. That'll teach him. Then last minute  I'm thinking  'Can't do this. This is wrong.' My buddy says  'C'mon  let's do this.' I say  'Let's do this.'  And those three words  Tony's going to remember  because the next thing he knows  he hears the pop. There's the punk on the ground  puddle of blood. And that's felony murder       to life  parole at    if you're lucky  and Tony's not feeling very lucky. So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and I say   In this class  we will discuss the foundations of ethics   Tony interrupts me.  What are you going to teach me about right and wrong  I know what is wrong. I have done wrong. I am told every day  by every face I see  every wall I face  that I am wrong. If I ever get out of here  there will always be a mark by my name. I'm a convict  I am branded 'wrong.' What are you going to tell me about right and wrong   So I say to Tony   Sorry  but it's worse than you think. You think you know right and wrong  Then can you tell me what wrong is  No  don't just give me an example. I want to know about wrongness itself  the idea of wrong. What is that idea  What makes something wrong  How do we know that it's wrong  Maybe you and I disagree. Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong. Maybe it's you  maybe it's me    but we're not here to trade opinions  everyone's got an opinion. We are here for knowledge. Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy.  And something changes for Tony.  Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong. I want to know what is wrong. I want to know what I know.  What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy  the project that begins in wonder    what Kant called  admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within.  What can creatures like us know of such things  It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence    what Heidegger called  the always already there.  It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it    what Socrates called  the examined life.  Socrates  a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing. Socrates died in prison  his philosophy intact. So Tony starts doing his homework. He learns his whys and wherefores  his causes and correlations  his logic  his fallacies. Turns out  Tony's got the philosophy muscle. His body is in prison  but his mind is free. Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous  the epistemologically anxious  the ethically dubious  the metaphysically ridiculous. That's Plato  Descartes  Nietzsche and Bill Clinton. So when he gives me his final paper  in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure  I say   I don't know. Let us think about that.  Because in that moment  there's no mark by Tony's name  it's just the two of us standing there. It is not professor and convict  it is just two minds ready to do philosophy. And I say to Tony   Let's do this.  Thank you. My subject today is learning. And in that spirit  I want to spring on you all a pop quiz. Ready  When does learning begin  Now as you ponder that question  maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten  the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher. Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork. Maybe you've encountered the Zero to Three movement  which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones. And so your answer to my question would be  Learning begins at birth. Well today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible  but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology. And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we're born  while we're still in the womb. Now I'm a science reporter. I write books and magazine articles. And I'm also a mother. And those two roles came together for me in a book that I wrote called  Origins.   Origins  is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fetal origins. Fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago  and it's based on the theory that our health and well being throughout our lives is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb. Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me. I was myself pregnant while I was doing the research for the book. And one of the most fascinating insights I took from this work is that we're all learning about the world even before we enter it. When we hold our babies for the first time  we might imagine that they're clean slates  unmarked by life  when in fact  they've already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in. Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they're still in their mothers' bellies. First of all  they learn the sound of their mothers' voices. Because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus  the voices fetuses hear  starting around the fourth month of gestation  are muted and muffled. One researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher in the old  Peanuts  cartoon. But the pregnant woman's own voice reverberates through her body  reaching the fetus much more readily. And because the fetus is with her all the time  it hears her voice a lot. Once the baby's born  it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else's. How can we know this  Newborn babies can't do much  but one thing they're really good at is sucking. Researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples  so that if a baby sucks on one  it hears a recording of its mother's voice on a pair of headphones  and if it sucks on the other nipple  it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice. Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one. Scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them and resume their fast sucking when they get bored. This is how researchers discovered that  after women repeatedly read aloud a section of Dr. Seuss'  The Cat in the Hat  while they were pregnant  their newborn babies recognized that passage when they hear it outside the womb. My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born. So fetuses are even learning about the particular language that's spoken in the world that they'll be born into. A study published last year found that from birth  from the moment of birth  babies cry in the accent of their mother's native language. French babies cry on a rising note while German babies end on a falling note  imitating the melodic contours of those languages. Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful  It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival. From the moment of birth  the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it    its mother. It even makes its cries sound like the mother's language  which may further endear the baby to the mother  and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language. But it's not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero. It's also tastes and smells. By seven months of gestation  the fetus' taste buds are fully developed  and its olfactory receptors  which allow it to smell  are functioning. The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid  which is continuously swallowed by the fetus. Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they're out in the world. In one experiment  a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy  while another group of pregnant women drank only water. Six months later  the women's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice  and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it. The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot flavored cereal  and from the looks of it  they seemed to enjoy it more. A sort of French version of this experiment was carried out in Dijon  France where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with licorice flavored anise during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life  and again  when they were tested later  on their fourth day of life. Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as  yuck.  What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat. Fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they'll be joining through one of culture's most powerful expressions  which is food. They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture's cuisine even before birth. Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons. But before I get to that  I want to address something that you may be wondering about. The notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus    like playing Mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly. But actually  the nine month long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that. Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life    the air she breathes  the food and drink she consumes  the chemicals she's exposed to  even the emotions she feels    are shared in some fashion with her fetus. They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself. The fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body  makes them part of its flesh and blood. And often it does something more. It treats these maternal contributions as information  as what I like to call biological postcards from the world outside. So what a fetus is learning about in utero is not Mozart's  Magic Flute  but answers to questions much more critical to its survival. Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity  Will it be safe and protected  or will it face constant dangers and threats  Will it live a long  fruitful life or a short  harried one  The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind. The resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus' brain and other organs are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility  our ability to thrive in a huge variety of environments  from the country to the city  from the tundra to the desert. To conclude  I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they're born. In the autumn of       the darkest days of World War II  German troops blockaded Western Holland  turning away all shipments of food. The opening of the Nazi's siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades    so cold the water in the canals froze solid. Soon food became scarce  with many Dutch surviving on just     calories a day    a quarter of what they consumed before the war. As weeks of deprivation stretched into months  some resorted to eating tulip bulbs. By the beginning of May  the nation's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted. The specter of mass starvation loomed. And then on May  th        the siege came to a sudden end when Holland was liberated by the Allies. The  Hunger Winter   as it came to be known  killed some        people and weakened thousands more. But there was another population that was affected    the        fetuses in utero during the siege. Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths  birth defects  low birth weights and infant mortality. But others wouldn't be discovered for many years. Decades after the  Hunger Winter   researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege have more obesity  more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions. These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways. They have higher blood pressure  poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance    a precursor of diabetes. Why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later  One explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation. When food is scarce  they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ  the brain  and away from other organs like the heart and liver. This keeps the fetus alive in the short term  but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs  deprived early on  become more susceptible to disease. But that may not be all that's going on. It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly. They're preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb. The fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it. And the basis of the fetus' prediction is what its mother eats. The meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story  a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation. This story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems    an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival. Faced with severely limited resources  a smaller sized child with reduced energy requirements will  in fact  have a better chance of living to adulthood. The real trouble comes when pregnant women are  in a sense  unreliable narrators  when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty. This is what happened to the children of the Dutch  Hunger Winter.  And their higher rates of obesity  diabetes and heart disease are the result. Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post war Western diet. The world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born. Here's another story. At      a.m. on September   th        there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the World Trade Center in New York    commuters spilling off trains  waitresses setting tables for the morning rush  brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.       of these people were pregnant women. When the planes struck and the towers collapsed  many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster    the overwhelming chaos and confusion  the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris  the heart pounding fear for their lives. About a year after       researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack. In the babies of those women who developed post traumatic stress syndrome  or PTSD  following their ordeal  researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to PTSD    an effect that was most pronounced in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester. In other words  the mothers with post traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero. Now consider this  post traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong  causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering. But there's another way of thinking about PTSD. What looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances. In a particularly dangerous environment  the characteristic manifestations of PTSD    a hyper awareness of one's surroundings  a quick trigger response to danger    could save someone's life. The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive is still speculative  but I find it rather poignant. It would mean that  even before birth  mothers are warning their children that it's a wild world out there  telling them   Be careful.  Let me be clear. Fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy. It's about discovering how best to promote the health and well being of the next generation. That important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb. Learning is one of life's most essential activities  and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined. Thank you. Good afternoon. As you're all aware  we face difficult economic times. I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden. This idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT. He was struggling to explain something to me  a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter. Now he confused me from the very start  because light doesn't cool things down. It makes it hotter. It's happening right now. The reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than     quintillion photons  and they're moving randomly through the space  near the speed of light. All of them are different colors  they're rippling with different frequencies  and they're bouncing off every surface  including me  and some of those are flying directly into your eyes  and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here. Now a laser is different. It also uses photons  but they're all synchronized  and if you focus them into a beam  what you have is an incredibly useful tool. The control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye  you can use it to store massive amounts of data  and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain. First you trap atoms in a special bottle. It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment. And the atoms themselves are quite violent  but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency  an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down. Little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero. Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough  something truly bizarre happens. It's no longer a solid  a liquid or a gas. It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid. The atoms lose their individual identity  and the rules from the quantum world take over  and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties. For example  if you shine light through a superfluid  it is able to slow photons down to    kilometers per hour. Another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction  so if you were to take the lid off that bottle  it won't stay inside. A thin film will creep up the inside wall  flow over the top and right out the outside. Now of course  the moment that it does hit the outside environment  and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree  it immediately turns back into normal matter. Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered. And this is the great pleasure of science  the defeat of our intuition through experimentation. But the experiment is not the end of the story  because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people. I have a Ph.D in molecular biology. I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about. So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment  it seemed like the more he said  the less I understood. Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea  to really capture its essence  the fewer words you use  the better. In fact  the ideal may be to use no words at all. I remember thinking  my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance. Of course  there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them. Now  the idea is not as crazy as it sounds. I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D. Instead of explaining their research with words  scientists have to explain it with dance. Now surprisingly  it seems to work. Dance really can make science easier to understand. But don't take my word for it. Go on the Internet and search for  Dance Your Ph.D.  There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you. The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research. For example  at the University of Minnesota  there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde  and he works with dancers to study how cells move. They do it by changing their shape. When a chemical signal washes up on one side  it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side  because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment. So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions. But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside  because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers  and those fibers are constantly falling apart. But just as quickly as they explode  more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer  so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same. Now  David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab  but before he does that  he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place. It's basically efficient brainstorming  and when I visited David to learn about his research  he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method  PowerPoint. And this brings me to my modest proposal. I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy. Now it does depend on how you measure it  of course  but one estimate has put the drain at     million dollars per day. Now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of        dollars  and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time  and given that there are some apparently    million PowerPoint presentations created every day  that would indeed add up to an annual waste of     billion dollars. Of course  that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations. There are other costs  because PowerPoint is a tool  and like any tool  it can and will be abused. To borrow a concept from my country's CIA  it helps you to soften up your audience. It distracts them with pretty pictures  irrelevant data. It allows you to create the illusion of competence  the illusion of simplicity  and most destructively  the illusion of understanding. So now my country is    trillion dollars in debt. Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money. One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts. For example  our National Endowment for the Arts  with its      million budget  slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one thousandth of a percent. One certainly can't argue with those numbers. However  once we eliminate public funding for the arts  there will be some drawbacks. The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed. Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution  and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods. All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place. I shall now  therefore  humbly propose my own thoughts  which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. Once we eliminate public funding for the artists  let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint. As a test case  I propose we start with American dancers. After all  they are the most perishable of their kind  prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our health care system. Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds  we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems. Imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank. It's sure to help. Of course someday  in the deep future  a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented  rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric. However  I trust that by that day  we shall have passed this present financial calamity. Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion.
