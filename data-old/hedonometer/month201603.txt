I'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement. Yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment  graffiti style    or  more specifically  without permission and unsanctioned. But when I started this over    years ago  I didn't have a word for it  I didn't have any ambitious notions about it  I had no visions of grandeur. All I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human like on the cold  steel  gray facade that I looked at everyday. So I wrapped the door handle. I call this the Alpha Piece. Little did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life. So clearly the reaction was interesting. It intrigued me and I thought   What else could I do   Could I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction  So I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house. The reaction was wild. People would park their cars and get out of their cars and stare at it  and scratch their heads and stare at it  and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it  and all of that was really exciting to me and I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood. And the more that I did  the stronger the reaction. So at this point I'm smitten. I'm hooked. This was all seductive. I found my new passion and the urban environment was my playground. So this is some of my early work. I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary  the mundane  even the ugly  and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a well tailored suit out of knitting. And this was fun for me. It was really fun to take inanimate objects and have them come to life. So ... I think we all see the humor in this  but    I was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously. I wanted to analyze it. I wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life  why I was passionate about it  why were other people reacting so strongly to it. And I realized something. We all live in this fast paced  digital world  but we still crave and desire something that's relatable. I think we've all become desensitized by our overdeveloped cities that we live in  and billboards and advertisements  and giant parking lots  and we don't even complain about that stuff anymore. So when you stumble upon a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting and it seems so out of place and then gradually    weirdly    you find a connection to it  that is the moment. That is the moment I love and that is the moment I love to share with others. So at this point  my curiosity grew. It went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles to what else can I do with this material. Can I do something big and large scale and insurmountable  So that's when the bus happened. This was a real game changer for me. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one. At this point  people were recognizing my work but there wasn't much out there that was wrapped in knitting that was large scale  and this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting. So at this point  I'm experiencing  or I'm witnessing something interesting. I may have started yarn bombing but I certainly don't own it anymore. It had reached global status. People from all over the world were doing this. And I know this because I would travel to certain parts of the world that I'd never been to  and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and I knew I didn't wrap it. So as I pursued my own goals with my art    this is a lot of my recent work    so was yarn bombing. Yarn bombing was also growing. And that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft and showed me that there was this common language I had with the rest of the world. It was through this granny hobby    this unassuming hobby    that I found commonality with people that I never thought I'd have a connection with. So as I tell my story today  I'd also like to convey to you that hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places  and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered. If you think about our hands  these tools that are connected to us  and what they're capable of doing    building houses and furniture  and painting giant murals    and most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone. And I'm totally guilty of this as well. But if you think about it  what would happen if you put those things down  What would you make  What would you create with your own hands  A lot of people think that I am a master knitter but I actually couldn't knit a sweater to save my life. But I did something interesting with knitting that had never been done before. I also wasn't  supposed to be  an artist in the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this    I'm a math major actually. So I didn't think this was in the cards for me  but I also know that I didn't stumble upon this. And when this happened to me  I held on tight  I fought for it and I'm proud to say that I am a working artist today. So as we ponder the future  know that your future might not be so seamless. And one day  you might be as bored as I was and knit a door handle to change your world forever. Thank you. So you go to the doctor and get some tests. The doctor determines that you have high cholesterol and you would benefit from medication to treat it. So you get a pillbox. You have some confidence  your physician has some confidence that this is going to work. The company that invented it did a lot of studies  submitted it to the FDA. They studied it very carefully  skeptically  they approved it. They have a rough idea of how it works  they have a rough idea of what the side effects are. It should be OK. You have a little more of a conversation with your physician and the physician is a little worried because you've been blue  haven't felt like yourself  you haven't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do. Your physician says   You know  I think you have some depression. I'm going to have to give you another pill.  So now we're talking about two medications. This pill also    millions of people have taken it  the company did studies  the FDA looked at it    all good. Think things should go OK. Think things should go OK. Well  wait a minute. How much have we studied these two together  Well  it's very hard to do that. In fact  it's not traditionally done. We totally depend on what we call  post marketing surveillance   after the drugs hit the market. How can we figure out if bad things are happening between two medications  Three  Five  Seven  Ask your favorite person who has several diagnoses how many medications they're on. Why do I care about this problem  I care about it deeply. I'm an informatics and data science guy and really  in my opinion  the only hope    only hope    to understand these interactions is to leverage lots of different sources of data in order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely and when it's not so safe. So let me tell you a data science story. And it begins with my student Nick. Let's call him  Nick   because that's his name. Nick was a young student. I said   You know  Nick  we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately  and we don't have a great understanding. But the FDA has made available an amazing database. It's a database of adverse events. They literally put on the web    publicly available  you could all download it right now    hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports from patients  doctors  companies  pharmacists. And these reports are pretty simple  it has all the diseases that the patient has  all the drugs that they're on  and all the adverse events  or side effects  that they experience. It is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today  but it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs. So I said to Nick   Let's think about glucose. Glucose is very important  and we know it's involved with diabetes. Let's see if we can understand glucose response. I sent Nick off. Nick came back.  Russ   he said   I've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database  and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not.  He did it. It was very simple  in a way. He took all the drugs that were known to change glucose and a bunch of drugs that don't change glucose  and said   What's the difference in their side effects  Differences in fatigue  In appetite  In urination habits   All those things conspired to give him a really good predictor. He said   Russ  I can predict with    percent accuracy when a drug will change glucose.  I said   Nick  that's great.  He's a young student  you have to build his confidence.  But Nick  there's a problem. It's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose  because it's core to our practice. So it's great  good job  but not really that interesting  definitely not publishable.  He said   I know  Russ. I thought you might say that.  Nick is smart.  I thought you might say that  so I did one other experiment. I looked at people in this database who were on two drugs  and I looked for signals similar  glucose changing signals  for people taking two drugs  where each drug alone did not change glucose  but together I saw a strong signal.  And I said   Oh  You're clever. Good idea. Show me the list.  And there's a bunch of drugs  not very exciting. But what caught my eye was  on the list there were two drugs  paroxetine  or Paxil  an antidepressant  and pravastatin  or Pravachol  a cholesterol medication. And I said   Huh. There are millions of Americans on those two drugs.  In fact  we learned later     million Americans on paroxetine at the time     million on pravastatin  and a million  we estimated  on both. So that's a million people who might be having some problems with their glucose if this machine learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the FDA database actually holds up. But I said   It's still not publishable  because I love what you did with the mumbo jumbo  with the machine learning  but it's not really standard of proof evidence that we have.  So we have to do something else. Let's go into the Stanford electronic medical record. We have a copy of it that's OK for research  we removed identifying information. And I said   Let's see if people on these two drugs have problems with their glucose.  Now there are thousands and thousands of people in the Stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin. But we needed special patients. We needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement  then got the second one and had another glucose measurement  all within a reasonable period of time    something like two months. And when we did that  we found    patients. However  eight out of the    had a bump in their glucose when they got the second P    we call this P and P    when they got the second P. Either one could be first  the second one comes up  glucose went up    milligrams per deciliter. Just as a reminder  you walk around normally  if you're not diabetic  with a glucose of around   . And if it gets up to           your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes. So a    bump    pretty significant. I said   Nick  this is very cool. But  I'm sorry  we still don't have a paper  because this is    patients and    give me a break    it's not enough patients.  So we said  what can we do  And we said  let's call our friends at Harvard and Vanderbilt  who also    Harvard in Boston  Vanderbilt in Nashville  who also have electronic medical records similar to ours. Let's see if they can find similar patients with the one P  the other P  the glucose measurements in that range that we need. God bless them  Vanderbilt in one week found    such patients  same trend. Harvard found     patients  same trend. So at the end  we had     patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly. More interestingly  we had left out diabetics  because diabetics already have messed up glucose. When we looked at the glucose of diabetics  it was going up    milligrams per deciliter  not just   . This was a big deal  and we said   We've got to publish this.  We submitted the paper. It was all data evidence  data from the FDA  data from Stanford  data from Vanderbilt  data from Harvard. We had not done a single real experiment. But we were nervous. So Nick  while the paper was in review  went to the lab. We found somebody who knew about lab stuff. I don't do that. I take care of patients  but I don't do pipettes. They taught us how to feed mice drugs. We took mice and we gave them one P  paroxetine. We gave some other mice pravastatin. And we gave a third group of mice both of them. And lo and behold  glucose went up    to    milligrams per deciliter in the mice. So the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone  but we added a little note at the end  saying  oh by the way  if you give these to mice  it goes up. That was great  and the story could have ended there. But I still have six and a half minutes. So we were sitting around thinking about all of this  and I don't remember who thought of it  but somebody said   I wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs are noticing side effects of hyperglycemia. They could and they should. How would we ever determine that   We said  well  what do you do  You're taking a medication  one new medication or two  and you get a funny feeling. What do you do  You go to Google and type in the two drugs you're taking or the one drug you're taking  and you type in  side effects.  What are you experiencing  So we said OK  let's ask Google if they will share their search logs with us  so that we can look at the search logs and see if patients are doing these kinds of searches. Google  I am sorry to say  denied our request. So I was bummed. I was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research and I said   We wanted to do this study  Google said no  it's kind of a bummer.  He said   Well  we have the Bing searches.  Yeah. That's great. Now I felt like I was    I felt like I was talking to Nick again. He works for one of the largest companies in the world  and I'm already trying to make him feel better. But he said   No  Russ    you might not understand. We not only have Bing searches  but if you use Internet Explorer to do searches at Google  Yahoo  Bing  any ... Then  for    months  we keep that data for research purposes only.  I said   Now you're talking   This was Eric Horvitz  my friend at Microsoft. So we did a study where we defined    words that a regular person might type in if they're having hyperglycemia  like  fatigue    loss of appetite    urinating a lot    peeing a lot     forgive me  but that's one of the things you might type in. So we had    phrases that we called the  diabetes words.  And we did first a baseline. And it turns out that about .  to one percent of all searches on the Internet involve one of those words. So that's our baseline rate. If people type in  paroxetine  or  Paxil     those are synonyms    and one of those words  the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes type words  if you already know that there's that  paroxetine  word. If it's  pravastatin   the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline. If both  paroxetine  and  pravastatin  are present in the query  it goes up to    percent  a huge three  to four fold increase in those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in  and diabetes type words or hyperglycemia type words. We published this  and it got some attention. The reason it deserves attention is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly through their searches. We brought this to the attention of the FDA. They were interested. They have set up social media surveillance programs to collaborate with Microsoft  which had a nice infrastructure for doing this  and others  to look at Twitter feeds  to look at Facebook feeds  to look at search logs  to try to see early signs that drugs  either individually or together  are causing problems. What do I take from this  Why tell this story  Well  first of all  we have now the promise of big data and medium sized data to help us understand drug interactions and really  fundamentally  drug actions. How do drugs work  This will create and has created a new ecosystem for understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use. Nick went on  he's a professor at Columbia now. He did this in his PhD for hundreds of pairs of drugs. He found several very important interactions  and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug drug interactions. However  there's a couple of things. We don't just use pairs of drugs at a time. As I said before  there are patients on three  five  seven  nine drugs. Have they been studied with respect to their nine way interaction  Yes  we can do pair wise  A and B  A and C  A and D  but what about A  B  C  D  E  F  G all together  being taken by the same patient  perhaps interacting with each other in ways that either makes them more effective or less effective or causes side effects that are unexpected  We really have no idea. It's a blue sky  open field for us to use data to try to understand the interaction of drugs. Two more lessons  I want you to think about the power that we were able to generate with the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions through their pharmacists  through themselves  through their doctors  the people who allowed the databases at Stanford  Harvard  Vanderbilt  to be used for research. People are worried about data. They're worried about their privacy and security    they should be. We need secure systems. But we can't have a system that closes that data off  because it is too rich of a source of inspiration  innovation and discovery for new things in medicine. And the final thing I want to say is  in this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story. The two drugs actually caused problems. They increased glucose. They could throw somebody into diabetes who would otherwise not be in diabetes  and so you would want to use the two drugs very carefully together  perhaps not together  make different choices when you're prescribing. But there was another possibility. We could have found two drugs or three drugs that were interacting in a beneficial way. We could have found new effects of drugs that neither of them has alone  but together  instead of causing a side effect  they could be a new and novel treatment for diseases that don't have treatments or where the treatments are not effective. If we think about drug treatment today  all the major breakthroughs    for HIV  for tuberculosis  for depression  for diabetes    it's always a cocktail of drugs. And so the upside here  and the subject for a different TED Talk on a different day  is how can we use the same data sources to find good effects of drugs in combination that will provide us new treatments  new insights into how drugs work and enable us to take care of our patients even better  Thank you very much. There are times when I feel really quite ashamed to be a European. In the last year  more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help  and our response  frankly  has been pathetic. There are just so many contradictions. We mourn the tragic death of two year old Alan Kurdi  and yet  since then  more than     children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean. We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility  and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined. We lament the existence of human smugglers  and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe. We have labor shortages  and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe. We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam  and yet    we have repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers  that separate children from their families  and that seize property from refugees. What are we doing  How has the situation come to this  that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis  I don't believe it's because people don't care  or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care. I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision  a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over    years ago for a changing and globalized world. And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions  the two questions we all need to ask. First  why is the current system not working  And second  what can we do to fix it  So the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys. Its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails  or worse  turns against its own people  people have somewhere to go  to live in safety and dignity until they can go home. It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today. Through an international convention signed by     governments  the      Convention on the Status of Refugees  and an international organization  UNHCR  states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory who flee conflict and persecution. But today  that system is failing. In theory  refugees have a right to seek asylum. In practice  our immigration policies block the path to safety. In theory  refugees have a right to a pathway to integration  or return to the country they've come from. But in practice  they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo. In theory  refugees are a shared global responsibility. In practice  geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees. The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong. It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world  and that's what we need to reconsider. So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works. How does the refugee regime actually work  But not from a top down institutional perspective  rather from the perspective of a refugee. So imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira. And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region. Amira  like around    percent of the world's refugees  is a woman with children  and she can't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you  Homs  a once beautiful and historic city now under rubble. And so Amira can't go back there. But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country  because that's a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees. So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice. They have three basic options. The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp. In the camp  she might get assistance  but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family. Camps are in bleak  arid locations  often in the desert. In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan  you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime. There's restricted economic activity. Education is often of poor quality. And around the world  some    percent of refugees who are in camps have to stay for at least five years. It's a miserable existence  and that's probably why  in reality  only nine percent of Syrians choose that option. Alternatively  Amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country  like Amman or Beirut. That's an option that about    percent of Syrian refugees have taken. But there  there's great difficulty as well. Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work. They don't usually get significant access to assistance. And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings  they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution. So there's a third alternative  and it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking. Amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country  and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today. Around the world  we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options  encampment  urban destitution and dangerous journeys. For refugees  that choice is the global refugee regime today. But I think it's a false choice. I think we can reconsider that choice. The reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees  and they're not. Politicians frame the issue as a zero sum issue  that if we benefit refugees  we're imposing costs on citizens. We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society. But they don't have to. They can contribute. So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set and still benefit everyone else  the host states and communities  our societies and refugees themselves. And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees. All four ways have one thing in common  they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization  mobility and markets  and update the way we think about the refugee issue. The first one I want to think about is the idea of enabling environments  and it starts from a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else  but they're just in extraordinary circumstances. Together with my colleagues in Oxford  we've embarked on a research project in Uganda looking at the economic lives of refugees. We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries. It's not. It's exceptional. Unlike most host countries around the world  what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity. It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement. And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community. In the capital city  Kampala  we found that    percent of refugees own a business that employs other people  and    percent of those employees are nationals of the host country. In other words  refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country. Even in the camps  we found extraordinary examples of vibrant  flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses. For example  in a settlement called Nakivale  we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music exchange businesses. We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions. Against the odds of extreme constraint  refugees are innovating  and the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou Kay. Demou Kay arrived in the settlement with very little  but he wanted to be a filmmaker. So with friends and colleagues  he started a community radio station  he rented a video camera  and he's now making films. He made two documentary films with and for our team  and he's making a successful business out of very little. It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees. Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance  we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing. Yes  clothes  blankets  shelter  food are all important in the emergency phase  but we need to also look beyond that. We need to provide opportunities to connectivity  electricity  education  the right to work  access to capital and banking. All the ways in which we take for granted that we are plugged in to the global economy can and should apply to refugees. The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones. Unfortunately  not every host country in the world takes the approach Uganda has taken. Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees in the same way. But there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use. Last April  I traveled to Jordan with my colleague  the development economist Paul Collier  and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government  an idea to bring jobs to Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy. The idea is for an economic zone  one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals. And just    minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp  home to        refugees  is an existing economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area. The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid  connecting it to the road network  but it lacked two things  access to labor and inward investment. So what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps  able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to Syria  We recognized that that could benefit Jordan  whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufacturing. It could benefit refugees  but it could also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees as the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria. We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs. King Abdullah has picked up on the idea. It was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago  and a pilot will begin in the summer. The third idea that I want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee. What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want  where they want to go  but I'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off. The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets  ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match. My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees  to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations  but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match. Now  of course you'd need to build in quotas on things like diversity and vulnerability  but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching. The matching idea has been successfully used to match  for instance  students with university places  to match kidney donors with patients  and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites. So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice  It could also be used at the national level  where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refugees. And at the moment  in my country  for instance  we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities  which makes no sense at all. So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves. The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas. Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe was entirely avoidable. It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy  which is the following  that in order to seek asylum in Europe  you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys that I described. But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern consular capabilities  They're completely unnecessary journeys  and last year  they led to the deaths of over       people on Europe's borders and within European territory. If refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe  we would avoid that  and there's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa  that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to Europe. It costs around a thousand euros to take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands. It costs     euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt. If we allowed refugees to do that  it would have major advantages. It would save lives  it would undercut the entire market for smugglers  and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line in areas like the Greek islands. It's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution. And this is an idea that has been applied. Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach where over       Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas  enter Brazil  and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil. And in that scheme  every Syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee. There is a historical precedent for it as well. Between      and       these Nansen passports were used as travel documents to allow         Assyrians  Turks and Chechens to travel across Europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe. And the Nansen International Refugee Office received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this being a viable strategy. So all four of these ideas that I've presented you are ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set. They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic  impossible three options I explained to you and still leave others better off. In conclusion  we really need a new vision  a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden. There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost. Yes  they are a humanitarian responsibility  but they're human beings with skills  talents  aspirations  with the ability to make contributions    if we let them. In the new world  migration is not going to go away. What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years. People will continue to travel  they'll continue to be displaced  and we need to find rational  realistic ways of managing this    not based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance  not based on logics of charity  but building on the opportunities offered by globalization  markets and mobility. I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge. Thank you very much. Today I wanted to    well  this morning    I want to talk about the future of human driven transportation  about how we can cut congestion  pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars  and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets. And yes  I'm talking about smartphones ... not self driving cars. But to get started we've got to go back over     years. Because it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber. And if it had survived  the future of transportation would probably already be here. So let me introduce you to the jitney. In      it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper. He was a car salesman from LA  and he had an idea. Well  he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles  my hometown  and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go. He said  well  why don't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney    that was slang for a nickel. And so people jumped on board  and not just in Los Angeles but across the country. And within one year  by       there were        rides per day in Seattle         rides per day in Kansas and         rides per day in Los Angeles. To give you some perspective  Uber in Los Angeles is doing         rides per day  today ...     years later. And so these are the trolley guys  the existing transportation monopoly at the time. They were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut. And so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney. And there were all kinds of regulations. There were licenses    often they were pricey. In some cities  if you were a jitney driver  you were required to be in the jitney for    hours a day. In other cities  they required two jitney drivers for one jitney. But there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light    install it in every Jitney    to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning. All right. So what happened  Well  within a year this thing had taken off. But the jitney  by       was regulated completely out of existence. That's unfortunate ... because  well  when you can't share a car  then you have to own one. And car ownership skyrocketed and it's no wonder that by       there was a car for every man  woman and child in the United States. And that phenomenon had gone global. In China by       there were more car sales happening in China than in the US. Now  all this private ownership of course had a public cost. In the US  we spend   billion hours a year  wasted  sitting in traffic.     billion dollars in lost productivity  of course also sitting in traffic  and one fifth of all of our carbon footprint is spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in. Now  that's only four percent of our problem though. Because if you have to own a car then that means    percent of the time your car is sitting idle. And so  up to    percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel. We even have skyscrapers built for cars. That's the world we live in today. Now  cities have been dealing with this problem for decades. It's called mass transit. And even in a city like New York City  one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world  there are still  .  million cars that go over those bridges every day. Why is that  Well  it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out how to get to everybody's doorstep. And so back in San Francisco  where I live  the situation's much worse  in fact  much worse around the world. And so the beginning of Uber in      was    well  we just wanted to push a button and get a ride. We didn't have any grand ambitions. But it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride  and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides. We saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place. And so we started thinking about  well  how do we make those two trips and turn them into one. Because if we did  that ride would be a lot cheaper    up to    percent cheaper    and of course for the city you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars. And so the big question for us was  would it work  Could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it  And the answer  fortunately  is a resounding yes. In San Francisco  before uberPOOL  we had    well  everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted. And the bright colors is where we have the most cars. And once we introduced uberPOOL  well  you see there's not as many bright colors. More people getting around the city in fewer cars  taking cars off the road. It looks like uberPOOL is working. And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles eight months ago. And since then  we've taken  .  million miles off the roads and we've taken  .  thousand metric tons of CO  out of the air. But the part that I'm really    But my favorite statistic    remember  I'm from LA  I spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel  going   How do we fix this      my favorite part is that eight months later  we have added         new people that are carpooling every week. Now  in China everything is supersized  and so we're doing    million uberPOOL trips per month  that's         per day. And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen. In fact  we're seeing it in LA  too. And when I talk to my team  we don't talk about   Hey  well          people carpooling every week and we're done.  How do we get that to a million  And in China  well  that could be several million. And so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling. But what about the suburbs  This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles  it's actually a suburb called Northridge  California  and  well    look  those mailboxes  they kind of just go on forever. And every morning at about the same time  cars roll of out their driveway  most of them  one person in the car  and they go to work  they go to their place of work. So the question for us is  well  how do we turn all of these commuter cars    and literally there's tens of millions of them    how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars  Well  we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE. You get up in the morning  get ready for work  get your coffee  go to your car and you light up the Uber app  and all of a sudden  you become an Uber driver. And we'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work and it's a really great thing. There's just one hitch ... it's called regulation. So    cents a mile  what is that  Well  that is what the US government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile. You can pick up anybody in the United States and take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice  for    cents a mile or less. But if you charge    cents a mile  you're a criminal. But what if for    cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles  And what if at    cents a mile we could get    million people carpooling in the United States  If we could  it's obviously something we should do. And so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney. If by      this thing was taking off  imagine without the regulations that happened  if that thing could just keep going. How would our cities be different today  Would we have parks in the place of parking lots  Well  we lost that chance. But technology has given us another opportunity. Now  I'm as excited as anybody else about self driving cars but do we have to really wait five     or even    years to make our new cities a reality  With the technology in our pockets today  and a little smart regulation  we can turn every car into a shared car  and we can reclaim our cities starting today. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Travis  thank you. Travis Kalanick  Thank you. CA  You know    I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding. You only just talked about a small part of it here    a powerful part    the idea of turning cars into public transport like that  it's cool. But I've got a couple other questions because I know they're out there on people's minds. So first of all  last week I think it was  I switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber and I couldn't find the app. You had this very radical  very bold  brave redesign. TK  Sure. CA  How did it go  Did you notice other people not finding the app that day  Are you going to win people over for this redesign  TK  Well  first I should probably just say  well  what we were trying to accomplish. And I think if you know a little bit about our history  it makes a lot more sense. Which is  when we first got started  it was just black cars. It was literally you push a button and get an S Class. And so what we did was almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car. And as we've gone worldwide and gone from S Classes to auto rickshaws in India  it became something that was important for us to be more accessible  to be more hyperlocal  to be about the cities we were in and that's what you see with the patterns and colors. And to be more iconic  because a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit  and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin. And so that was a little bit what it was about. Now  when you first roll out something like that  I mean  your hands are sweating  you've got    you know  you're a little worried. What we saw is a lot of people    actually  at the beginning  we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it. And our numbers were slightly up from what we expected. CA  OK  that's cool. Now  so you  yourself  are something of an enigma  I would say. Your supporters and investors  who have been with you the whole way  believe that the only chance of sort of taking on the powerful  entrenched interests of taxi industry and so forth  is to have someone who is a fierce  relentless competitor  which you've certainly proved to be. Some people feel you've almost taken that culture too far  and you know    like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset. How did it feel like inside the company during that period  Did you notice a loss of business  Did you learn anything from that  TK  Well  look  I think    I've been an entrepreneur since I've been in high school and you have    In various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times and for us  it was about a year and a half ago  and for us it was hard times  too. Now  inside  we felt like    I guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work  but on the outside that wasn't evident. And so there was a lot that we had to do to sort of    We'd gone from a very small company    I mean if you go literally two and a half years ago  our company was     people  and today it's      . And so when you go through that growth  you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time. And make sure that people are constantly checking to say   Are we good people doing good work   And if you check those boxes  the next part of that is making sure you're telling your story. And I think we learned a lot of lessons but I think at the end of it we came out stronger. But it was certainly a difficult period. CA  It seems to me  everywhere you turn  you're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time. Some Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere are mad as hell now because you changed the fees and they can barely    they claim    barely afford the deal anymore. How    You know  you said that you started this originally    just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride. This thing's taken off  you're affecting the whole global economy  basically  at this point. You're being forced to be  whether you want it or not  a kind of global visionary who's changing the world. I mean    who are you  Do you want that  Are you ready to go with that and be what that takes  TK  Well  there's a few things packed in that question  so    First is on the pricing side    I mean  keep in mind  right  UberX  when we first started  was literally    or    percent cheaper than our black car product. It's now in many cities  half the price of a taxi. And we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers. What happens is when the price goes down  people are more likely to take Uber at different times of the day than they otherwise would have  and they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before. And what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off  they're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in. And so what that means is more trips per hour  more minutes of the hour where they're productive and actually  earnings come up. And we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time. So even in New York    We have a blog post we call    Septembers     compare the earnings September after September after September. Same month every year. And we see the earnings going up over time as the price comes down. And there's a perfect price point    you can't go down forever. And in those places where we bring the price down but we don't see those earnings pop  we bring the prices back up. So that addresses that first part. And then the enigma and all of this    I mean  the kind of entrepreneur I am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems. And the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor. You know  If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve  that's a really sad math professor. And so at Uber we like the hard problems and we like getting excited about those and solving them. But we don't want just any math problem  we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find  and we want the one that if you solve it  there's a little bit of a wow factor. CA  In a couple years' time    say five years' time  I don't know when    you roll out your incredible self driving cars  at probably a lower cost than you currently pay for an Uber ride. What do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time  TK  Explain that again    at which time  CA  At the time when self driving cars are coming    TK  Sure  sure  sure. Sorry  I missed that. CA  What do you say to a driver  TK  Well  look  I think the first part is it's going to take    it's likely going to take a lot longer than I think some of the hype or media might expect. That's part one. Part two is it's going to also take    there's going to be a long transition. These cars will work in certain places and not in others. For us it's an interesting challenge  right  Because  well    Google's been investing in this since       Tesla's going to be doing it  Apple's going to be doing it  the manufacturers are going to be doing it. This is a world that's going to exist  and for good reason. A million people die a year in cars. And we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide that people are spending sitting in them  driving frustrated  anxious. And think about the quality of life that improves when you give people their time back and it's not so anxiety ridden. So I think there's a lot of good. And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge  but one for optimistic leadership  Where instead of resisting    resisting technology  maybe like the taxi industry  or the trolley industry    we have to embrace it or be a part of the future. But how do we optimistically lead through it  Are there ways to partner with cities  Are there ways to have education systems  vocational training  etc.  for that transition period. It will take a lot longer than I think we all expect  especially that transition period. But it is a world that's going to exist  and it is going to be a better world. CA  Travis  what you're building is absolutely incredible and I'm hugely grateful to you for coming to TED and sharing so openly. Thank you so much. TK  Thank you very much. So a few years ago  I did something really brave  or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years  I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser  as an organizer  but in my heart  I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since     . She had never lost a race  and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary. But in my mind  this was my way to make a difference  to disrupt the status quo. The polls  however  told a very different story. My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run  that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway  and in       I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News  the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day  and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew  including Indian aunties that were just so happy an Indian girl was running. But on election day  the polls were right  and I only got    percent of the vote  and the same papers that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted  .  million dollars on       votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now  before you get the wrong idea  this is not a talk about the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was    years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave  where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone  so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they're going to be great in  that they know they're going to be perfect in  and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty  play it safe  get all A's. Boys  on the other hand  are taught to play rough  swing high  crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults  whether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date  they're habituated to take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley  no one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start ups. In other words  we're raising our girls to be perfect  and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry about our federal deficit  but I  I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy  our society  we're just losing out because we're not raising our girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM  in C suites  in boardrooms  in Congress  and pretty much everywhere you look. In the     s  psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls were quick to give up. The higher the IQ  the more likely they were to give up. Bright boys  on the other hand  found the difficult material to be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely to redouble their efforts. What's going on  Well  at the fifth grade level  girls routinely outperform boys in every subject  including math and science  so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only    percent of the qualifications  but women  women will apply only if they meet     percent of the qualifications.     percent. This study is usually invoked as evidence that  well  women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection  and they're overly cautious. And even when we're ambitious  even when we're leaning in  that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers. And so those         jobs that are open right now in computing and tech  women are being left behind  and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. So in       I started a company to teach girls to code  and what I found is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding  it's an endless process of trial and error  of trying to get the right command in the right place  with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart  and it often takes many  many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right  of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story. During the first week  when the girls are learning how to code  a student will call her over and she'll say   I don't know what code to write.  The teacher will look at her screen  and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better  she'd think that her student spent the past    minutes just staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times  she'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it. She tried  she came close  but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing the progress that she made  she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls are really good at coding  but it's not enough just to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie  who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students. When the guys are struggling with an assignment  they'll come in and they'll say   Professor  there's something wrong with my code.  The girls will come in and say   Professor  there's something wrong with me.  We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection  but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone. Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me   I'm afraid to raise my hand  I'm afraid to ask a question  because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand  the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on  they will build incredible things  and I see this every day. Take  for instance  two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run    yes  Tampon Run    to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help Americans get to the polls. Or a    year old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just three examples of thousands  thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect  who have learned to keep trying  who have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyonc   they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been more important for our country. For the American economy  for any economy to grow  to truly innovate  we cannot leave behind half our population. We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection  and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did when I was    years old. We have to teach them to be brave in schools and early in their careers  when it has the most potential to impact their lives and the lives of others  and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know    your sister  your niece  your employee  your colleague    to be comfortable with imperfection  because when we teach girls to be imperfect  and we help them leverage it  we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Reshma  thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have. You have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls are involved now in your program  Reshma Saujani  Yeah. So in       we taught    girls. This year we'll teach        in all    states. And that number is really powerful  because last year we only graduated       women in computer science. Like  the problem is so bad that we can make that type of change quickly. CA  And you're working with some of the companies in this room even  who are welcoming graduates from your program  RS  Yeah  we have about    partners  from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney  I mean  every single company out there. And if you're not signed up  I'm going to find you  because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office. CA  And you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams  good things happen. RS  Great things happen. I mean  I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now    percent of all consumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate of     percent more than men. We own the Internet  and we should be building the companies of tomorrow. And I think when companies have diverse teams  and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams  they build awesome things  and we see it every day. CA  Reshma  you saw the reaction there. You're doing incredibly important work. This whole community is cheering you on. More power to you. Thank you. RS  Thank you. Food crisis. It's in the news every day. But what is it  Some places in the world it's too little food  maybe too much. Other places  GMO is saving the world. Maybe GMO is the problem  Too much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans  toxic oceans  attenuation of nutrition. They go on and on. And I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disempowering. So how do we bring that to something that we understand  How is this apple food crisis  You've all eaten an apple in the last week  I'm sure. How old do you think it was from when it was picked  Two weeks  Two months  Eleven months    the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States. And I don't expect it to be much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world. We pick them  we put them in cold storage  we gas the cold storage    there's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple  and dying  because the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans. How is it that none of you knew this  Why didn't I know this  Ninety percent of the quality of that apple    all of the antioxidants    are gone by the time we get it. It's basically a little ball of sugar. How did we get so information poor and how can we do better  I think what's missing is a platform. I know platforms    I know computers  they put me on the Internet when I was young. I did very weird things    on this platform. But I met people  and I could express myself. How do you express yourself in food  If we had a platform  we might feel empowered to question  What if  For me  I questioned  What if climate was democratic  So  this is a map of climate in the world. The most productive areas in green  the least productive in red. They shift and they change  and Californian farmers now become Mexican farmers. China picks up land in Brazil to grow better food  and we're a slave to climate. What if each country had its own productive climate  What would that change about how we live  What would that change about quality of life and nutrition  The last generation's problem was  we need more food and we need it cheap. Welcome to your global farm. We built a huge analog farm. All these traces    these are cars  planes  trains and automobiles. It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food. What if ... we built a digital farm  A digital world farm. What if you could take this apple  digitize it somehow  send it through particles in the air and reconstitute it on the other side  What if  Going through some of these quotes  you know  they inspire me to do what I do. First one    Japanese farming has no youth  no water  no land and no future.   That's what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku  one stop south of Fukushima  after the disaster. The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo  the land is contaminated  they already import    percent of their own food. But it's not unique to Japan. Two percent of the American population is involved in farming. What good answer comes from two percent of any population  As we go around the world     percent of the African population is under   . Eighty percent don't want to be farmers. Farming is hard. The life of a small shareholder farmer is miserable. They go into the city. In India  farmers' families not being able to have basic access to utilities  more farmer suicides this year and the previous    before that. It's uncomfortable to talk about. Where are they going  Into the city. No young people  and everyone's headed in. So how do we build this platform that inspires the youth  Welcome to the new tractor. This is my combine. A number of years ago now  I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot and I started hacking. And I built silly things and I made plants dance and I attached them to my computer and I killed them all    a lot. I eventually got them to survive. And I created one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had in my life  because I was learning the language of plants. I wanted to make it bigger. They said   Knock yourself out  kid  Here's an old electronics room that nobody wants. What can you do   With my team  we built a farm inside of the media lab  a place historically known not for anything about biology but everything about digital life. Inside of these    square feet  we produced enough food to feed about     people once a month    not a lot of food. And there's a lot of interesting technology in there. But the most interesting thing  Beautiful  white roots  deep  green colors and a monthly harvest. Is this a new cafeteria  Is this a new retail experience  Is this a new grocery store  I can tell you one thing for sure  this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything. We get our salad in bags  there's nothing wrong with that. But what happens when you have an image based processing expert  a data scientist  a roboticist  ripping roots off and thinking   Huh. I know something about    I could make this happen  I want to try.  In that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab  because if you grew it  you don't throw it away  it's kind of precious to you. I have this weird tongue now  because I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first  because I want it to be good. So I eat lettuce every day and I can tell the pH of a lettuce within . . I'm like   No  that's  .     no  no  you can't eat it today.  This lettuce that day was hyper sweet. It was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself   I'm not going to die   And the plants not going to die  taste sweet to me. Technologists falling backwards into plant physiology. So we thought other people needed to be able to try this. We want to see what people can create  so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere. And then we built it. So on the facade of the media lab is my lab  that has about    points of sensing per plant. If you know about the genome or genetics  this is the phenome  right  The phenomena. When you say   I like the strawberries from Mexico   you really like the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression that you like. So if you're coding climate    this much CO   this much O  creates a recipe    you're coding the expression of that plant  the nutrition of that plant  the size of that plant  the shape  the color  the texture. We need data  so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what's going on. If you think of your houseplants  and you look at your houseplant and you're super sad  because you're like   Why are you dying  Won't you talk to me   Farmers develop the most beautiful fortune telling eyes by the time they're in their late   s and   s. They can tell you when you see that plant dying that it's a nitrogen deficiency  a calcium deficiency or it needs more humidity. Those beautiful eyes are not being passed down. These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer. We trend those data points over time. We correlate those data points to individual plants. These are all the broccoli in my lab that day  by IP address. We have IP addressable broccoli. So if that's not weird enough  you can click one and you get a plant profile. And what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant  but not like you'd think  it's not just when it's ready. When does it achieve the nutrition that I need  When does it achieve the taste that I desire  Is it getting too much water  Is it getting too much sun  Alerts. It can talk to me  it's conversant  we have a language. I think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook  right  That's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends. And I mean it    it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen  more phosphorus  less potassium. We're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now. And they may not friend us back    I don't know  they might friend us back  it depends on how we act. So this is my lab now. It's a little bit more systematized  my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things  so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment. And so    inside of this environment  we're experimenting with all kinds of things. This process  aeroponics  was developed by NASA for Mir Space Station for reducing the amount of water they send into space. What it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants  water  minerals and oxygen. Roots are not that complicated  so when you give them that  you get this amazing expression. It's like the plant has two hearts. And because it has two hearts  it grows four or five times faster. It's a perfect world. We've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world and we're going to continue to do that  but we're going to have a new tool  too  which is perfect world. So we've grown all kinds of things. These tomatoes hadn't been in commercial production for     years. Do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks  Banks of seed. It's amazing. They have germplasm alive and things that you've never eaten. I am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of tomato. Problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don't know how to cook  so we ate a sauce tomato  which is not that great. But we've done things with protein    we've grown all kinds of things. We've grown humans    Well maybe you could  but we didn't. But what we realized is  the tool was too big  it was too expensive. I was starting to put them around the world and they were about         dollars. Finding somebody with     grand in their back pocket isn't easy  so we wanted to make a small one. This project was actually one of my student's    mechanical engineering undergraduate  Camille. So Camille and I and my team  we iterated all summer  how to make it cheaper  how to make it work better  how to make it so other people can make it. Then we dropped them off in schools  seventh through eleventh grade. And if you want to be humbled  try to teach a kid something. So I went into this school and I said   Set it to    percent humidity.  The seventh grader said   What's humidity   And I said   Oh  it's water in air.  He said   There's no water in air  you're an idiot.  And I was like   Alright  don't trust me. Actually    don't trust me  right  Set it to    . He sets it to     and what happens  It starts to condense  make a fog and eventually drip. And he says   Oh. Humidity is rain. Why didn't you just tell me that   We've created an interface for this that's much like a game. They have a  D environment  they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smartphone  on their tablet. They have different parts of the bots    the physical  the sensors. They select recipes that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world. They select and activate that recipe  they plant a seedling. While it's growing  they make changes. They're like   Why does a plant need CO  anyway  Isn't CO  bad  It kills people.  Crank up CO   plant dies. Or crank down CO   plant does very well. Harvest plant  and you've created a new digital recipe. It's an iterative design and development and exploration process. They can download  then  all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do    was it better or was it worse  Imagine these as little cores of processing. We're going to learn so much. Here's one of the food computers  as we call them  in a school in three weeks' time. This is three weeks of growth. But more importantly  it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer    or that he would want to be a farmer. So  we've open sourced all of this. It's all online  go home  try to build your first food computer. It's going to be difficult    I'm just telling you. We're in the beginning  but it's all there. It's very important to me that this is easily accessible. We're going to keep making it more so. These are farmers  electrical engineer  mechanical engineer  environmental engineer  computer scientist  plant scientist  economist  urban planners. On one platform  doing what they're good at. But we got a little too big. This is my new facility that I'm just starting. This warehouse could be anywhere. That's why I chose it. And inside of this warehouse we're going to build something kind of like this. These exist right now. Take a look at it. These exist  too. One grows greens  one grows Ebola vaccine. Pretty amazing that plants and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner is one of the reasons we're getting ahead of Ebola. The plants are producing the protein that's Ebola resistant. So pharmaceuticals  nutraceuticals  all they way down to lettuce. But these two things look nothing alike  and that's where I am with my field. Everything is different. We're in that weird  We're alright  stage and it's like   Here's my black box      No  buy mine.   No  no  no    I've got intellectual property that's totally valuable. Don't buy his  buy mine.  And the reality is  we're just at the beginning  in a time when society is shifting  too. When we ask for more  cheaper food  we're now asking for better  environmentally friendly food. And when you have McDonald's advertising what's in the Chicken McNugget  the most mysterious food item of all time    they are now basing their marketing plan on that    everything is changing. So into the world now. Personal food computers  food servers and food data centers run on the open phenome. Think open genome  but we're going to put little climate recipes  like Wikipedia  that you can pull down  actuate and grow. What does this look like in a world  You remember the world connected by strings  We start having beacons. We start sending information about food  rather than sending food. This is not just my fantasy  this is where we're already deploying. Food computers  food servers  soon to be food data centers  connecting people together to share information. The future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this. We know what's wrong with this. The future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question   What if   Thank you. Well  I'm an ocean chemist. I look at the chemistry of the ocean today. I look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past. The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals. You can see an image of one of these corals behind me. It was collected from close to Antarctica  thousands of meters below the sea  so  very different than the kinds of corals you may have been lucky enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday. So I'm hoping that this talk will give you a four dimensional view of the ocean. Two dimensions  such as this beautiful two dimensional image of the sea surface temperature. This was taken using satellite  so it's got tremendous spatial resolution. The overall features are extremely easy to understand. The equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight. The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight. And that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica and up in the Northern Hemisphere. If you plunge deep into the sea  or even put your toes in the sea  you know it gets colder as you go down  and that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense. If we travel back in time        years ago  the earth looked very much different. And I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long. The icecaps were much bigger. They covered lots of the continent  and they extended out over the ocean. Sea level was     meters lower. Carbon dioxide  levels  were very much lower than they are today. So the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall  and much  much colder in the polar regions. What I'm trying to understand  and what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand  is how we moved from that cold climate condition to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today. We know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn't smooth  as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation. And we know this from ice cores  because if you drill down into ice  you find annual bands of ice  and you can see this in the iceberg. You can see those blue white layers. Gases are trapped in the ice cores  so we can measure CO     that's why we know CO  was lower in the past    and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature in the polar regions. And if you move in time from        years ago to the modern day  you see that temperature increased. It didn't increase smoothly. Sometimes it increased very rapidly  then there was a plateau  then it increased rapidly. It was different in the two polar regions  and CO  also increased in jumps. So we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this. The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon  about    times more than is in the atmosphere. It also acts to transport heat across the equator  and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity. So if we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea  we really need to get down there  see what's there and start to explore. This is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount about a kilometer deep in international waters in the equatorial Atlantic  far from land. You're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor  along with my research team. You're probably seeing new species. We don't know. You'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy. You can see beautiful bubblegum corals. There are brittle stars growing on these corals. Those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals. There are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain  and the dark sort of stuff  those are fossilized corals  and we're going to talk a little more about those as we travel back in time. To do that  we need to charter a research boat. This is the James Cook  an ocean class research vessel moored up in Tenerife. Looks beautiful  right  Great  if you're not a great mariner. Sometimes it looks a little more like this. This is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples. Everyone's scurrying around  and I get terribly seasick  so it's not always a lot of fun  but overall it is. So we've got to become a really good mapper to do this. You don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere. It is global and it is deep  but we need to really find the right places. We just saw a global map  and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year. This was a seven week cruise  and this is us  having made our own maps of about        square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks  but that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor. We're traveling from west to east  over part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big scale map  but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest. So with the maps that we make on board  we get about     meter resolution  enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment  but not enough to see very much. To do that  we need to fly remotely operated vehicles about five meters off the seafloor. And if we do that  we can get maps that are one meter resolution down thousands of meters. Here is a remotely operated vehicle  a research grade vehicle. You can see an array of big lights on the top. There are high definition cameras  manipulator arms  and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples. Here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise  plunging down into the ocean. We go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships. And we go down  and these are the kinds of things you see. These are deep sea sponges  meter scale. This is a swimming holothurian    it's a small sea slug  basically. This is slowed down. Most of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up  because all of this takes a lot of time. This is a beautiful holothurian as well. And this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise. I've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised. This was after about    hours of work and we were all a bit trigger happy  and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past. It's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate  if you like. This wasn't what we were looking for. We were looking for corals  deep sea corals. You're going to see a picture of one in a moment. It's small  about five centimeters high. It's made of calcium carbonate  so you can see its tentacles there  moving in the ocean currents. An organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years. And as it grows  it takes in chemicals from the ocean. And the chemicals  or the amount of chemicals  depends on the temperature  it depends on the pH  it depends on the nutrients. And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton  we can then go back  collect fossil specimens  and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past. And here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system  and we put it into a sampling container. We can do this very carefully  I should add. Some of these organisms live even longer. This is a black coral called Leiopathes  an image taken by my colleague  Brendan Roark  about     meters below Hawaii. Four thousand years is a long time. If you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up  this is about     microns across. And Brendan took some analyses across this coral    you can see the marks    and he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands  so even at     meters deep in the ocean  corals can record seasonal changes  which is pretty spectacular. But       years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum. So what do we do  We go in for these fossil specimens. This is what makes me really unpopular with my research team. So going along  there's giant sharks everywhere  there are pyrosomes  there are swimming holothurians  there's giant sponges  but I make everyone go down to these dead fossil areas and spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor. And we pick up all these corals  bring them back  we sort them out. But each one of these is a different age  and if we can find out how old they are and then we can measure those chemical signals  this helps us to find out what's been going on in the ocean in the past. So on the left hand image here  I've taken a slice through a coral  polished it very carefully and taken an optical image. On the right hand side  we've taken that same piece of coral  put it in a nuclear reactor  induced fission  and every time there's some decay  you can see that marked out in the coral  so we can see the uranium distribution. Why are we doing this  Uranium is a very poorly regarded element  but I love it. The decay helps us find out about the rates and dates of what's going on in the ocean. And if you remember from the beginning  that's what we want to get at when we're thinking about climate. So we use a laser to analyze uranium and one of its daughter products  thorium  in these corals  and that tells us exactly how old the fossils are. This beautiful animation of the Southern Ocean I'm just going to use illustrate how we're using these corals to get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks. You can see the density of the surface water in this animation by Ryan Abernathey. It's just one year of data  but you can see how dynamic the Southern Ocean is. The intense mixing  particularly the Drake Passage  which is shown by the box  is really one of the strongest currents in the world coming through here  flowing from west to east. It's very turbulently mixed  because it's moving over those great big undersea mountains  and this allows CO  and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out. And essentially  the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean. We've collected corals from back and forth across this Antarctic passage  and we've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating  the corals migrated from south to north during this transition from the glacial to the interglacial. We don't really know why  but we think it's something to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water. So here we are. I'm going to illustrate what I think we've found about climate from those corals in the Southern Ocean. We went up and down sea mountains. We collected little fossil corals. This is my illustration of that. We think back in the glacial  from the analysis we've made in the corals  that the deep part of the Southern Ocean was very rich in carbon  and there was a low density layer sitting on top. That stops carbon dioxide coming out of the ocean. We then found corals that are of an intermediate age  and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition. That allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean. And then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day  or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure the chemistry of the corals  we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out. So this is the way we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment. So I want to leave you with this last slide. It's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you. This is a spectacular coral garden. We didn't even expect to find things this beautiful. It's thousands of meters deep. There are new species. It's just a beautiful place. There are fossils in amongst  and now I've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals that are down there. So next time you're lucky enough to fly over the ocean or sail over the ocean  just think    there are massive sea mountains down there that nobody's ever seen before  and there are beautiful corals. Thank you. In India  we have these huge families. I bet a lot of you all must have heard about it. Which means that there are a lot of family events. So as a child  my parents used to drag me to these family events. But the one thing that I always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins. And there was always this one uncle who used to be there  always ready  jumping around with us  having games for us  making us kids have the time of our lives. This man was extremely successful  he was confident and powerful. But then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's. Parkinson's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system  which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee  because of tremors  much more difficult. My uncle started using a walker to walk  and to take a turn  he literally had to take one step at a time  like this  and it took forever. So this person  who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering  was suddenly hiding behind people. He was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes. And he's not the only one in the world. Every year         people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's  and this number is only rising. As designers  we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems  one solution that solves it all  but it need not always be like that. You can also target simple problems and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact. So my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's  but to make their everyday tasks much more simple  and then make an impact. Well  the first thing I targeted was tremors  right  My uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment  so  well  I designed the no spill cup. It works just purely on its form. The curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors  and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup. But the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product. It looks like a cup that could be used by you  me  any clumsy person  and that makes it much more comforting for them to use  to blend in. So  well  one problem solved  many more to go. All this while  I was interviewing him  questioning him  and then I realized that I was getting very superficial information  or just answers to my questions. But I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective. So I thought  well  let's observe him in his daily tasks  while he's eating  while he's watching TV. And then  when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table  it struck me  this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land  how does he climb a staircase  Because in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries. One actually has to climb the stairs. So he told me   Well  let me show you how I do it.  Let's take a look at what I saw. So he took really long to reach this position  and then all this while  I'm thinking   Oh my God  is he really going to do it  Is he really  really going to do it without his walker   And then ... And the turns  he took them so easily. So    shocked  Well  I was too. So this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs. On researching this  I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion. There's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms and uses a walker  but the moment he's put on a cycle  all his symptoms vanish  because it is a continuous motion. So the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land. And a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him  but the one that finally worked was this one. Let's take a look. He walked faster  right  I call this the staircase illusion  and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended  he froze  and this is called freezing of gait. So it happens a lot  so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms  making them feel much more confident  You know  technology is not always it. What we need are human centered solutions. I could have easily made it into a projection  or a Google Glass  or something like that. But I stuck to simple print on the floor. This print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome. What I wish to do is make every Parkinson's patient feel like my uncle felt that day. He told me that I made him feel like his old self again.  Smart  in today's world has become synonymous to high tech  and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day. But why can't smart be something that's simple and yet effective  All we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity  to go out there  observe. But let's not stop at that. Let's find these complex problems. Don't be scared of them. Break them  boil them down into much smaller problems  and then find simple solutions for them. Test these solutions  fail if needed  but with newer insights to make it better. Imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions. What would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions  Let's make a smarter world  but with simplicity. Thank you. In case you are wondering  no  I'm not wearing a dress  and no  I'm not saying what I'm wearing underneath. This is a gho. This is my national dress. This is how all men dress in Bhutan. That is how our women dress. Like our women  we men get to wear pretty bright colors  but unlike our women  we get to show off our legs. Our national dress is unique  but this is not the only thing that's unique about my country. Our promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique  and this is what I'd like to speak about today  our promise to remain carbon neutral. But before I proceed  I should set you the context. I should tell you our story. Bhutan is a small country in the Himalayas. We've been called Shangri La  even the last Shangri La. But let me tell you right off the bat  we are not Shangri La. My country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks. The reality is that there are barely         of us sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth  China and India. The reality is that we are a small  underdeveloped country doing our best to survive. But we are doing OK. We are surviving. In fact  we are thriving  and the reason we are thriving is because we've been blessed with extraordinary kings. Our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly to develop our country  balancing economic growth carefully with social development  environmental sustainability and cultural preservation  all within the framework of good governance. We call this holistic approach to development  Gross National Happiness   or GNH. Back in the     s  our fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan  Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product. Ever since  all development in Bhutan is driven by GNH  a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness and well being of our people. But that's easier said than done  especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world. Our entire GDP is less than two billion dollars. I know that some of you here are worth more    individually than the entire economy of my country. So our economy is small  but here is where it gets interesting. Education is completely free. All citizens are guaranteed free school education  and those that work hard are given free college education. Healthcare is also completely free. Medical consultation  medical treatment  medicines  they are all provided by the state. We manage this because we use our limited resources very carefully  and because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH  which is development with values. Our economy is small  and we must strengthen it. Economic growth is important  but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture or our pristine environment. Today  our culture is flourishing. We continue to celebrate our art and architecture  food and festivals  monks and monasteries. And yes  we celebrate our national dress  too. This is why I can wear my gho with pride. Here's a fun fact  you're looking at the world's biggest pocket. It starts here  goes around the back  and comes out from inside here. In this pocket we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets to iPads  office files and books. But sometimes    sometimes even precious cargo. So our culture is flourishing  but so is our environment.    percent of my country is under forest cover. Our constitution demands that a minimum of    percent of Bhutan's total land shall remain under forest cover for all time. Our constitution  this constitution  imposes forest cover on us. Incidentally  our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us. You see  we the people didn't want democracy. We didn't ask for it  we didn't demand it  and we certainly didn't fight for it. Instead  our king imposed democracy on us by insisting that he include it in the constitution. But he went further. He included provisions in the constitution that empower the people to impeach their kings  and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire at the age of   . Fact is  we already have a king in retirement  our previous king  the Great Fourth  retired    years ago at the peak of his popularity. He was all of    years at that time. So as I was saying     percent of our country is under forest cover  and all that forest is pristine. That's why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hotspots in the world  and that's why we are a carbon neutral country. In a world that is threatened with climate change  we are a carbon neutral country. Turns out  it's a big deal. Of the     odd countries in the world today  it looks like we are the only one that's carbon neutral. Actually  that's not quite accurate. Bhutan is not carbon neutral. Bhutan is carbon negative. Our entire country generates  .  million tons of carbon dioxide  but our forests  they sequester more than three times that amount  so we are a net carbon sink for more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year. But that's not all. We export most of the renewable electricity we generate from our fast flowing rivers. So today  the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood. By       we'll be exporting enough electricity to offset    million tons of carbon dioxide. And if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential  and that's exactly what we are working at  the clean  green energy that we export would offset something like    million tons of carbon dioxide a year. That is more CO  than what the entire city of New York generates in one year. So inside our country  we are a net carbon sink. Outside  we are offsetting carbon. And this is important stuff. You see  the world is getting warmer  and climate change is a reality. Climate change is affecting my country. Our glaciers are melting  causing flash floods and landslides  which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country. I was at that lake recently. It's stunning. That's how it looked    years ago  and that's how it looked    years ago. Just    years ago  that lake didn't exist. It was a solid glacier. A few years ago  a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below. That destruction was caused by one glacier lake. We have       of them to contend with. The point is this  my country and my people have done nothing to contribute to global warming  but we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences. And for a small  poor country  one that is landlocked and mountainous  it is very difficult. But we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing. We will fight climate change. That's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral. We first made this promise in      during COP    in Copenhagen  but nobody noticed. Governments were so busy arguing with one another and blaming each other for causing climate change  that when a small country raised our hands and announced   We promise to remain carbon neutral for all time   nobody heard us. Nobody cared. Last December in Paris  at COP     we reiterated our promise to remain carbon neutral for all time to come. This time  we were heard. We were noticed  and everybody cared. What was different in Paris was that governments came round together to accept the realities of climate change  and were willing to come together and act together and work together. All countries  from the very small to the very large  committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change says that if these so called intended commitments are kept  we'd be closer to containing global warming by two degrees Celsius. By the way  I've requested the TED organizers here to turn up the heat in here by two degrees  so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual  you know who to blame. It's crucial that all of us keep our commitments. As far as Bhutan is concerned  we will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral. Here are some of the ways we are doing it. We are providing free electricity to our rural farmers. The idea is that  with free electricity  they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food. We are investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles. Similarly  we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights  and our entire government is trying to go paperless. We are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan  a national program  and we are planting trees throughout our country through Green Bhutan  another national program. But it is our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy. Our protected areas are our carbon sink. They are our lungs. Today  more than half our country is protected  as national parks  nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries. But the beauty is that we've connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors. Now  what this means is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country. Take this tiger  for example. It was spotted at     meters above sea level in the hot  subtropical jungles. Two years later  that same tiger was spotted near       meters in our cold alpine mountains. Isn't that awesome  We must keep it that way. We must keep our parks awesome. So every year  we set aside resources to prevent poaching  hunting  mining and pollution in our parks  and resources to help communities who live in those parks manage their forests  adapt to climate change  and lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature. But that is expensive. Over the next few years  our small economy won't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment. In fact  when we run the numbers  it looks like it'll take us at least    years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts. But neither Bhutan  nor the world can afford to spend    years going backwards. This is why His Majesty the King started Bhutan For Life. Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need. It gives us breathing room. It is essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks  to protect our parks  until our government can take over on our own fully. The idea is to raise a transition fund from individual donors  corporations and institutions  but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met and all funds committed. So multiparty  single closing  an idea we borrowed from Wall Street. This means that individual donors can commit without having to worry that they'll be left supporting an underfunded plan. It's something like a Kickstarter project  only with a    year time horizon and millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake. Once the deal is closed  we use the transition fund to protect our parks  giving our government time to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the    year period. After that  our government guarantees full funding forever. We are almost there. We expect to close later this year. Naturally  I'm pretty excited. The World Wildlife Fund is our principle partner in this journey  and I want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work they are doing in Bhutan and across the world. Whew  it is getting warm in here. I thank you for listening to our story  a story of how we are keeping our promise to remain carbon neutral  a story of how we are keeping our country pristine  for ourselves  our children  for your children and for the world. But we are not here to tell stories  are we  We are here to dream together. So in closing  I'd like to share one more dream that I have. What if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources  our influence and our passion  to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea to other countries so that they too can conserve their protected areas for all time. After all  there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face. They too have natural resources that can help win the world's fight for sustainability  only they may not have the ability to invest in them now. So what if we set up Earth For Life  a global fund  to kickstart the Bhutan For Life throughout the world  I invite you to help me  to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those who care about our planet's future. After all  we're here to dream together  to work together  to fight climate change together  to protect our planet together. Because the reality is we are in it together. Some of us might dress differently  but we are in it together. Thank you very much  and kadrin chhe la. Thank you. Thank you  thank you  thank you. I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata. It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale. And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff. And he buys a piece of art that I made. And it turns out he's alone in town for the night  driving cross country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps. So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world. Now it's starting to get late  and I'm getting pretty tired. As I motion for the tab  I make the mistake of asking him   So where are you staying tonight   And he makes it worse by saying   Actually  I don't have a place.  And I'm thinking   Oh  man   What do you do  We've all been there  right  Do I offer to host this guy  But  I just met him    I mean  he says he's going to the Peace Corps  but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata. That's a small trunk  So then I hear myself saying   Hey  I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room.  And the voice in my head goes   Wait  what   That night  I'm laying in bed  I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking   Oh my god  what have I done  There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room. What if he's psychotic   My anxiety grows so much  I leap out of bed  I sneak on my tiptoes to the door  and I lock the bedroom door. It turns out he was not psychotic. We've kept in touch ever since. And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom  he's a teacher now. This was my first hosting experience  and it completely changed my perspective. Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered. The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco  I brought the airbed with me. So now it's two years later. I'm unemployed  I'm almost broke  my roommate moves out  and then the rent goes up. And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town  and all the hotels are sold out. And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity. So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky   Brian  thought of a way to make a few bucks    turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast ' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash  complete with wireless Internet  a small desk space  sleeping mat  and breakfast each morning. Ha   We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born. Three lucky guests got to stay on a    dollar airbed on the hardwood floor. But they loved it  and so did we. I swear  the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests. We took them on adventures around the city  and when we said goodbye to the last guest  the door latch clicked  Brian and I just stared at each other. Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent  The wheels had started to turn. My old roommate  Nate Blecharczyk  joined as engineering co founder. And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business. Here's what we pitched investors   We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces  their bedrooms  the bathrooms    the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over. And then  over the Internet  they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes. It's going to be huge   We sat back  and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off. It did not. No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes. Why  Because we've all been taught as kids  strangers equal danger. Now  when you're faced with a problem  you fall back on what you know  and all we really knew was design. In art school  you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something    it's the whole experience. We learned to do that for objects  but here  we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met. Could design make that happen  Is it possible to design for trust  I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve. I've got a    second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone. If you're up for it  give me a thumbs up. OK  I need you to take out your phones. Now that you have your phone out  I'd like you to unlock your phone. Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left. That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now    is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home. Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home. People don't just see your messages  they see your bedroom  your kitchen  your toilet. Now  how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone  Most of us feel really responsible. That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home. And it's because of this that our company can even exist. By the way  who's holding Al Gore's phone  Would you tell Twitter he's running for President  OK  you can hand your phones back now. So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing  I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way. What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment  What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first  with their name  where they're from  the name of their kids or their dog  Imagine that they had     reviews of people saying   They're great at holding unlocked phones   Now how would you feel about handing your phone over  It turns out  a well designed reputation system is key for building trust. And we didn't actually get it right the first time. It's hard for people to leave bad reviews. Eventually  we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them. Now  here's a discovery we made just last week. We did a joint study with Stanford  where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age  location and geography. The research showed  not surprisingly  we prefer people who are like us. The more different somebody is  the less we trust them. Now  that's a natural social bias. But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix  in this case  with reviews. Now  if you've got less than three reviews  nothing changes. But if you've got more than     everything changes. High reputation beats high similarity. The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases. Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure. This is what happens when a guest first messages a host. If you share too little  like   Yo   acceptance rates go down. And if you share too much  like   I'm having issues with my mother   acceptance rates also go down. But there's a zone that's just right  like   Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family.  So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure  We use the size of the box to suggest the right length  and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing. We bet our whole company on the hope that  with the right design  people would be willing to overcome the stranger danger bias. What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside. This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption. There's three things happening here. The first  an unbelievable amount of luck. The second is the efforts of our team. And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need. Now  things have been going pretty well. Obviously  there are times when things don't work out. Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes. Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain. In the early days  I was customer service  and those calls came right to my cell phone. I was at the front lines of trust breaking. And there's nothing worse than those calls  it hurts to even think about them. And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and  I would say  still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving. Thankfully  out of the     million nights we've ever hosted  less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic. Turns out  people are justified in their trust. And when trust works out right  it can be absolutely magical. We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay  and he suffered a heart attack. The host rushed him to the hospital. They donated their own blood for his operation. Let me read you his review.  Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions. The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals. Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you. They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass. They don't want you to feel lonely  they bring you books to read. And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you. Highly recommended   Of course  not every stay is like that. But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for. Now  when I heard that term  I have to admit  it tripped me up. How do sharing and transactions go together  So let's be clear  it is about commerce. But if you just called it the rental economy  it would be incomplete. The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection. People share a part of themselves  and that changes everything. You know how most travel today is  like  I think of it like fast food    it's efficient and consistent  at the cost of local and authentic. What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences  What if anywhere you visited  there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed. Or learning to cook from the chef of a five star restaurant  Today  homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation. What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up  What would that look like  What if cities embraced a culture of sharing  I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation. In South Korea  in the city of Seoul  they've actually even started this. They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents. They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty nesters who have extra rooms. And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start ups. Tonight  just on our service          people in     countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs. Clearly  it's not as crazy as we were taught. We didn't invent anything new. Hospitality has been around forever. There's been many other websites like ours. So  why did ours eventually take off  Luck and timing aside  I've learned that you can take the components of trust  and you can design for that. Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger danger bias. And that's amazing to me. It blows my mind. I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by. Now  we know design won't solve all the world's problems. But if it can help out with this one  if it can make a dent in this  it makes me wonder  what else can we design for next  Thank you. So in college  I was a government major  which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now  when a normal student writes a paper  they might spread the work out a little like this. So  you know    you get started maybe a little slowly  but you get enough done in the first week that  with some heavier days later on  everything gets done  things stay civil. And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go  but then  actually  the paper would come along  and then I would kind of do this. And that would happen every single paper. But then came my    page senior thesis  a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that  my normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out  and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light  and I'd bump it up in the middle months  and then at the end  I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs  No big deal  right  But then  the funniest thing happened. Those first few months  They came and went  and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. And then    But then those middle months actually went by  and I didn't really write words  and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month  which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline  still not having written a word  and so I did the only thing I could  I wrote    pages over    hours  pulling not one but two all nighters    humans are not supposed to pull two all nighters    sprinted across campus  dove in slow motion  and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call  and it's the school. And they say   Is this Tim Urban   And I say   Yeah.  And they say   We need to talk about your thesis.  And I say   OK.  And they say   It's the best one we've ever seen.  That did not happen. It was a very  very bad thesis. I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought   This guy is amazing   No  no  it was very  very bad. Anyway  today I'm a writer blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago  I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non procrastinators around me  and I wanted to explain to the non procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators  and why we are the way we are. Now  I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this  I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non procrastinator  so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not a trained brain expert  it's not that obvious  but just take a look  OK  So here's the brain of a non procrastinator. Now ... here's my brain. There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational Decision Maker in them  but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now  what does this mean for the procrastinator  Well  it means everything's fine until this happens.  This is a perfect time to get some work done.   Nope   So the Rational Decision Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive  but the Monkey doesn't like that plan  so he actually takes the wheel  and he says   Actually  let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan  Tonya Harding scandal  because I just remembered that that happened. Then    Then we're going to go over to the fridge  to see if there's anything new in there since    minutes ago. After that  we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much  much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom.  All of that's going to take a while  so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry   Now  what is going on here  The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past  no knowledge of the future  and he only cares about two things  easy and fun. Now  in the animal world  that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things  you're a huge success  And to the Monkey  humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well slept  well fed and propagating into the next generation  which in tribal times might have worked OK. But  if you haven't noticed  now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization  and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have another guy in our brain  the Rational Decision Maker  who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long term plans. And he wants to take all of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now  sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun  like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times  it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant  for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator  that conflict tends to end a certain way every time  leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone  an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground. Now  the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun  because it's completely unearned  and the air is filled with guilt  dread  anxiety  self hatred    all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is  in this situation  with the Monkey behind the wheel  how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone  a less pleasant place  but where really important things happen  Well  turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel  someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments    someone called the Panic Monster. Now  the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time  but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment  a career disaster or some other scary consequence. And importantly  he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of. Now  he became very relevant in my life pretty recently  because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. Now  of course  I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past. But in the middle of all this excitement  the Rational Decision Maker seemed to have something else on his mind. He was saying   Are we clear on what we just accepted  Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future  We need to sit down and work on this right now.  And the Monkey said   Totally agree  but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India  like     feet above the ground  and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country  so we can get a better feel for India.  So that's what we did that day. As six months turned into four and then two and then one  the people of TED decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website  and there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up  So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind  and a few seconds later  the whole system's in mayhem. And the Monkey    remember  he's terrified of the Panic Monster    boom  he's up the tree  And finally  finally  the Rational Decision Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. Now  the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior  like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper  and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation  with the three characters    this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty  but in the end  it works. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago. When I did  I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in  from all different kinds of people from all over the world  doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses  bankers  painters  engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. And they were all writing  saying the same thing   I have this problem too.  But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives  about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this  and I said  well  if the procrastinator's system works  then what's going on  Why are all of these people in such a dark place  Well  it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today  the examples I've given  they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines  the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career where you're a self starter    something in the arts  something entrepreneurial    there's no deadlines on those things at first  because nothing's happening  not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum  get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines  like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health  working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working. Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster  that's a problem  because in all of these non deadline situations  the Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for  so the effects of procrastination  they're not contained  they just extend outward forever. And it's this long term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier  short term deadline based kind. It's usually suffered quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long term unhappiness  and regrets. And I thought  that's why those people are emailing  and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project. It's that long term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator  at times  in their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams  it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them. So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany    that I don't think non procrastinators exist. That's right    I think all of you are procrastinators. Now  you might not all be a mess  like some of us  and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines  but remember  the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. Now  I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That's one box for every week of a    year life. That's not that many boxes  especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long  hard look at that calendar. We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on  because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there  it's a job that should probably start today. Well  maybe not today  but ... You know. Sometime soon. Thank you. Hannah is excited to be going to college. She couldn't wait to get out of her parents' house  to prove to them that she's an adult  and to prove to her new friends that she belongs. She heads to a campus party where she sees a guy that she has a crush on. Let's call him Mike. The next day  Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache. She can only remember the night in flashes. But what she does remember is throwing up in the hall outside Mike's room and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her  wanting it to stop  then shakily stumbling home. She doesn't feel good about what happened  but she thinks   Maybe this is just what sex in college is   One in five women and one in    men will be sexually assaulted at some point during their college career in the United States. Less than    percent will ever report their assault to their school or to the police. And those who do  on average  wait    months to make the report. Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own. But when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties  she's worried about them. After graduation  Hannah learns that she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to. And this is not an unlikely scenario because    percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders. But with such low reporting rates  it's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported  much less anything happen if they are. In fact  only six percent of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison. Meaning  there's a    percent chance that they'll get away with it. This means there's practically no deterrent to assault in the United States. Now  I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training. I'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good. So this  to me  is a tragic but a solvable problem. So when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago  it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change. And so we did. We started by talking to college survivors. And what they wish they'd had in college is pretty simple  they wanted a website  one they could use at the time and place that felt safest to them with clearly written information about their reporting options  with the ability to electronically report their assault  rather than having the first step to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them. With the option to create a secure  timestamped document of what happened to them  preserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet. And lastly  and perhaps most critically  with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant. You see  knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything. It changes the way you frame your own experience  it changes the way you think about your perpetrator  it means that if you do come forward  you'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours. We created a website that actually does this and we launched it  ...  in August  on two college campuses. And we included a unique matching system where if Mike's first victim had come forward  saved her record  entered into the matching system and named Mike  and Mike's second victim had done the same thing a few months later  they would have matched and the verified contact information of both survivors would have been sent to the authorities at the same time for investigation and follow up. If a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers  it's more likely that they would have reported  that they would have been believed  and that Mike would have been kicked off campus  gone to jail  or at least gotten the help that he needed. And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike after just their second assault following a match  survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place. We could prevent    percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on. And because we're creating a real deterrent to assault  for perhaps the first time  maybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone. The type of system I'm describing  the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow  meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre agreed upon conditions are met  such as a match. The application that we built is for college campuses. But the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace. We don't have to live in a world where    percent of rapists get away with it. We can create one where those who do wrong are held accountable  where survivors get the support and justice they deserve  where the authorities get the information they need  and where there's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being. Thank you. I come from one of the most liberal  tolerant  progressive places in the United States  Seattle  Washington. And I grew up with a family of great Seattlites. My mother was an artist  my father was a college professor  and I am truly grateful for my upbringing  because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as I saw fit. And in point of fact  I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind. When I was     I dropped out of college    dropped out  kicked out  splitting hairs. And I went on the road as a professional French horn player  which was my lifelong dream. I played chamber music all over the United States and Europe  and I toured for a couple of years with a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird. And by the end of my   s  I wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain. What a great life. And you know  my parents never complained. They supported me all the way through it. It wasn't their dream. They used to tell their neighbors and friends   Our son  he's taking a gap decade.  And    There was  however  one awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I want to tell you about. I was     and I was home from Barcelona  and I was visiting my parents for Christmas  and I was cooking dinner with my mother  and we were alone in the kitchen. And she was quiet  too quiet. Something was wrong. And so I said   Mom  what's on your mind   And she said   Your dad and I are really worried about you.  And I said   What   I mean  what could it be  at this point  And she said   I want you to be completely honest with me  have you been voting for Republicans   Now  the truth is  I wasn't really political  I was just a French horn player. But I had a bit of an epiphany  and they had detected it  and it was causing some confusion. You see  I had become an enthusiast for capitalism  and I want to tell you why that is. It stems from a lifelong interest of mine in  believe it or not  poverty. See  when I was a kid growing up in Seattle  I remember the first time I saw real poverty. We were a lower middle class family  but that's of course not real poverty. That's not even close. The first time I saw poverty  and poverty's face  was when I was six or seven years old  early     s. And it was like a lot of you  kind of a prosaic example  kind of trite. It was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine of a kid who was my age in East Africa  and there were flies on his face and a distended belly. And he wasn't going to make it  and I knew that  and I was helpless. Some of you remember that picture  not exactly that picture  one just like it. It introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world. Well  that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school and I dropped out and dropped in and started my family. And I wondered  what happened to that kid  Or to people just like him all over the world  And so I started to study  even though I wasn't in college  I was looking for the answer  what happened to the world's poorest people  Has it gotten worse  Has it gotten better  What  And I found the answer  and it changed my life  and I want to share it with you. See    most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children  since they saw that vision. If you ask Americans   Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world       percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early     s. But here's the truth. Here's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking. From      until today  the percentage of the world's population living in starvation levels  living on a dollar a day or less  obviously adjusted for inflation  that percentage has declined by    percent. There's been an    percent decline in the world's worst poverty since I was a kid. And I didn't even know about it. This  my friends  that's a miracle. That's something we ought to celebrate. It's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind  and it happened in our lifetimes. So when I learned this  I asked  what did that  What made it possible  Because if you don't know why  you can't do it again. If you want to replicate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty  because that's what we're talking about  since I was a kid  two billion of the least of these  our brothers and sisters  have been pulled out of poverty. I want the next two billion  so I've got to know why. And I went in search of an answer. And it wasn't a political answer  because I didn't care. You know what  I still don't care. I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists left  right and center. And here it is. Here are the reasons. There are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid. Number one  globalization. Number two  free trade. Number three  property rights. Number four  rule of law. Number five  entrepreneurship. It was the free enterprise system spreading around the world after      that did that. Now  I'm not naive. I know that free enterprise isn't perfect  and I know that free enterprise isn't everything we need to build a better world. But that is great. And that's beyond politics. Here's what I learned. This is the epiphany. Capitalism is not just about accumulation. At its best  it's about aspiration  which is what so many people on this stage talk about  is the aspiration that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterprise system. And we've got to share it with more people. Now  I want to tell you about a second epiphany that's related to that first one that I think can bring us progress  not just around the world  but right here at home. The best quote I've ever heard to summarize the thoughts that I've just given you about pulling people out of poverty is as follows   Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history. They have lifted billions out of poverty.  Who said it  It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan. Wrong. President Barack Obama said that. Why do I know it by heart  Because he said it to me. Crazy. And I said   Hallelujah.  But more than that  I said   What an opportunity.  You know what I was a thinking  It was at an event that we were doing on the subject at Georgetown University in May of     . And I thought  this is the solution to the biggest problem facing America today. What  It's coming together around these ideas  liberals and conservatives  to help people who need us the most. Now  I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis  in America and many countries around the world with political polarization. It's risen to critical  crisis levels. It's unpleasant. It's not right. There was an article last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals published in the West. And it was an article in      on political motive asymmetry. What's that  That's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based in love but your opponents' ideology is based in hate. It's common in world conflict. You expect to see this between Palestinians and Israelis  for example. What the authors of this article found was that in America today  a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from political motive asymmetry. A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate. Think about it. Think about it. Most people are walking around saying   You know  my ideology is based on basic benevolence  I want to help people  but the other guys  they're evil and out to get me.  You can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry. It's impossible. How do we solve it  Well  first  let's be honest  there are differences. Let's not minimize the differences. That would be really na ve. There's a lot of good research on this. A veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt. He's a psychology professor at New York University. He does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ. And he's shown  for example  that conservatives and liberals have a very different emphasis on what they think is important. For example  Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care about poverty    percent more than they care about economic liberty. And conservatives care about economic liberty    percent more than they care about poverty. Irreconcilable differences  right  We'll never come together. Wrong. That is diversity in which lies our strength. Remember what pulled up the poor. It was the obsession with poverty  accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world. We need each other  in other words  if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty. There's no other way. Hmm. How are we going to get that  It's a tricky thing  isn't it. We need innovative thinking. A lot of it's on this stage. Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal. We need investment overseas in a sustainable  responsible  ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes. But you know what we really need  We need a new day in flexible ideology. We need to be less predictable. Don't we  Do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable  Kinda conventional  Do you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you  Why is that dangerous  Because when we talk in this country about economics  on the right  conservatives  you're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government. And on the left  liberals  you're talking about economics  it's always about income inequality. Right  Now those are important things  really important to me  really important to you. But when it comes to lifting people up who are starving and need us today  those are distractions. We need to come together around the best ways to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal  and that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals and their obsession with poverty  and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets. That's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country  if we choose to take it. So how are we going to do it  How are we going to do it together  I've got to have some action items  not just for you but for me. Number one. Action item number one  remember  it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree. It's not good enough. We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us  because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools. Now  what are you going to do  How are you going to express that  Where does this start  It starts here. You know  all of us in this room  we're blessed. We're blessed with people who listen to us. We're blessed with prosperity. We're blessed with leadership. When people hear us  with the kind of unpredictable ideology  then maybe people will listen. Maybe progress will start at that point. That's number one. Number two. Number two  I'm asking you and I'm asking me to be the person specifically who blurs the lines  who is ambiguous  who is hard to classify. If you're a conservative  be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor. And if you're a liberal  be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsibly. If we do that  we get two things. Number one  we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get. And the second is that we might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect. And then maybe  just maybe  we'll all realize that our big differences aren't really that big after all. Thank you. Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how terrible they really are. I'd like to talk to you today about this problem  and how we can fix it with neuroscience. First  I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in      that had a profound impact on me. I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University  where I studied computer science and neuroscience  and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms to one day replace computers. And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation  of course  his phone lights up. And he pulls it towards himself  and he looks down and he starts typing. And then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes   Keep going. I'm with you.  But of course his eyes were glazed over  and the moment was dead. Meanwhile across the bar  I noticed another student holding his phone  this time towards a group. He was swiping through pictures on Instagram  and these kids were laughing hysterically. And that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology  really got me thinking. And the more I thought of it  the more I realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here  it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together. See  they were connected around something  just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire. And that's exactly what tools should do  I think. They should extend our bodies. And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite. Whether you're sending an email to your wife or you're composing a symphony or just consoling a friend  you're doing it in pretty much the same way. You're hunched over these rectangles  fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles. And I think this is the wrong way  I think we can start using a much more natural machine. We should use machines that bring our work back into the world. We should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses versus going against them. Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here. It's called the Meta  . Let's try it out. Now in front of me right now  I can see the audience  and I can see my very hands. And in three  two  one  we're going to see an immersive hologram appear  a very realistic hologram appear in front of me  of our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now. And of course this could be anything that we're shopping for or learning from  and I can use my hands to very nicely kind of move it around with fine control. And I think Iron Man would be proud. We're going to come back to this in just a bit. Now if you're anything like me  your mind is already reeling with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology  so let's look at a few. My mom is an architect  so naturally the first thing I imagined was laying out a building in  D space instead of having to use these  D floor plans. She's actually touching graphics right now and selecting an interior decor. This was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses. And this next use case is very personal to me  it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project  courtesy of UCSF. As a neuroscience student  I would always fantasize about the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures with an actual machine  where I could touch and play with the various brain structures. Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality  but to me  it's part of a much more important story    a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices  instead of the other way around. Now ... in the next few years  humanity's going to go through a shift  I think. We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world. Just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytellers  for painters  for brain surgeons  for interior decorators and maybe for all of us here today. And what I think we need to do as a community  is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience  instead of gamifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information. And that's what I'm very passionate about. Now  I want to tell you a little secret. In about five years    this is not the smallest device    in about five years  these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes that project holograms. And just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware    we buy it for the operating system    as a neuroscientist  I always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind  if you will. And it's very  very important that we get this right  because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we've lived with the Windows graphical user interface. And I don't know about you  but living inside of Windows scares me. To isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity  we use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines  instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom. And the principle we all revolve around is what's called the  Neural Path of Least Resistance.  At every turn  we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain on  for the first time  our brain's terms. In other words  we're trying to create a zero learning curve computer. We're building a system that you've always known how to use. Here are the first three design guidelines that we employ in this brand new form of user experience. First and foremost  you are the operating system. Traditional file systems are complex and abstract  and they take your brain extra steps to decode them. We're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance. Meanwhile  in augmented reality  you can of course place your holographic TED panel over here  and your holographic email on the other side of the desk  and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them. You could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for    or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show. Perfect. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back. The second interface guideline we call  touch to see.  What do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest  They try and reach out and touch it. And that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well. Turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception    that's the sense of our body parts in space. So by touching our work directly  we're not only going to control it better  we're also going to understand it much more deeply. Hence  touch to see. But it's not enough to experience things ourselves. We're inherently these social primates. And this leads me to our third guideline  the holographic campfire from our first story. Our mirror neuron subsystem suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other's faces and hands in  D. So if you look at the video behind me  you can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram  making eye contact  connected around this thing  instead of being distracted by external devices. Let's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind. So again  our favorite interface  the iOS of the mind. I'm going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses and leave it right here by the desk. I'm now with you  I'm in the moment  we're connecting. My spatial memory kicks in  and I can go ahead and grab it and bring it right back here  reminding me that I am the operating system. And now my proprioception is working  and I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand. But it's not enough to see things alone  so in a second  my co founder Ray is going to make a  D call    Ray  Hey Ray  how's it going  Guys  I can see this guy in front me in full  D. And he is photo realistic. Thank you. My mirror neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones in not too long. Ray  how's it going  Ray  Great. We're live today. MG  Ray  give the crowd a gift of the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier. Guys  this is not only going to change phones  it's also going to change the way we collaborate. Thank you so much. Thanks  Ray. Ray  You're welcome. MG  So folks  this is the message that I discovered in that bar in       The future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens. It's right here  inside of us. So if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today  it's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future  it's right here in     . Which is why all hundred of us at Meta  including the administrative staff  the executives  the designers  the engineers    before TED      we're all going to be throwing away our external monitors and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine. Thank you very much. Thank you  appreciate it. Thanks  guys. Chris Anderson  So help me out on one thing  because there've been a few augmented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there. And there's sometimes a debate among technologists about  are we really seeing the real thing on screen  There's this issue of field of view  that somehow the technology is showing a broader view than you would actually see wearing the glasses. Were we seeing the real deal there  MG  Absolutely the real deal. Not only that  we took extra measures to shoot it with a GoPro through the actual lens in the various videos that you've seen here. We want to try to simulate the experience for the world that we're actually seeing through the glasses  and not cut any corners. CA  Thank you so much for showing us that. MG  Thanks so much  I appreciate that. The following are my opinions  and do not reflect the opinions or policies of any particular prosecutor's office. I am a prosecutor. I believe in law and order. I am the adopted son of a police officer  a Marine and a hairdresser. I believe in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities. I love my job and the people that do it. I just think that it's our responsibility to do it better. By a show of hands  how many of you  by the age of     had either acted up in school  went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of  or drank alcohol before your legal age  All right. How many of you shoplifted  tried an illegal drug or got into a physical fight    yes  even with a sibling  Now  how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions  How many of you sitting here today think that you're a danger to society or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion  Point taken. When we talk about criminal justice reform  we often focus on a few things  and that's what I want to talk to you about today. But first I'm going to    since you shared with me  I'm going to give you a confession on my part. I went to law school to make money. I had no interest in being a public servant  I had no interest in criminal law  and I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor. Near the end of my first year of law school  I got an internship in the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court. I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston  plagued by gun violence and drug crime. My life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship. I walked into a courtroom  and I saw an auditorium of people who  one by one  would approach the front of that courtroom to say two words and two words only   Not guilty.  They were predominately black and brown. And then a judge  a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life altering decisions about that person without their input. They were predominately white. As each person  one by one  approached the front of that courtroom  I couldn't stop but think  How did they get here  I wanted to know their stories. And as the prosecutor read the facts of each case  I was thinking to myself  we could have predicted that. That seems so preventable... not because I was an expert in criminal law  but because it was common sense. Over the course of the internship  I began to recognize people in the auditorium  not because they were criminal masterminds but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any. My second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney  and in that experience I met many young men accused of murder. Even in our  worst   I saw human stories. And they all contained childhood trauma  victimization  poverty  loss  disengagement from school  early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system  all leading to a seat in a courtroom. Those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison  and it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom why we would spend so much money to keep this one person in jail for the next    years when we could have reinvested it up front  and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place. My third year of law school  I defended people accused of small street crimes  mostly mentally ill  mostly homeless  mostly drug addicted  all in need of help. They would come to us  and we would send them away without that help. They were in need of our assistance. But we weren't giving them any. Prosecuted  adjudged and defended by people who knew nothing about them. The staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work. The unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender. The power dynamic that I came to understand made me become a prosecutor. I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem. We know the criminal justice system needs reform  we know there are  .  million people in American jails and prisons  making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet. We know there's another seven million people on probation or parole  we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color  particularly poor people of color. And we know there are system failures happening everywhere that bring people to our courtrooms. But what we do not discuss is how ill equipped our prosecutors are to receive them. When we talk about criminal justice reform  we  as a society  focus on three things. We complain  we tweet  we protest about the police  about sentencing laws and about prison. We rarely  if ever  talk about the prosecutor. In the fall of       a young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department. He was    years old  he was African American and he was a senior at a local public school. He had his sights set on college but his part time  minimum wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity he needed to enroll in school. In a series of bad decisions  he stole    laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet. This led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of    felony charges. The potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most. But what he had little understanding of was the impact a criminal record would have on his future. I was standing in arraignments that day when Christopher's case came across my desk. And at the risk of sounding dramatic  in that moment  I had Christopher's life in my hands. I was    years old  a brand new prosecutor  and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make would impact Christopher's life. Christopher's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such  but I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer. For the most part  prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions  regardless of our intent. Despite our broad discretion  we learn to avoid risk at all cost  rendering our discretion basically useless. History has conditioned us to believe that somehow  the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety  despite evidence to the contrary. We're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins  so prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative at our case dispositions  or to take risks on people we might not otherwise. We stick to an outdated method  counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want  and that's safer communities. Yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher. They have little appreciation for what we can do. Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record  making it harder for him to get a job  setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing criminal justice system today. With a criminal record and without a job  Christopher would be unable to find employment  education or stable housing. Without those protective factors in his life  Christopher would be more likely to commit further  more serious crime. The more contact Christopher had with the criminal justice system  the more likely it would be that he would return again and again and again    all at tremendous social cost to his children  to his family and to his peers. And  ladies and gentlemen  it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us. When I came out of law school  I did the same thing as everybody else. I came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice  but I never learned what justice was in my classes    none of us do. None of us do. And yet  prosecutors are the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system. Our power is virtually boundless. In most cases  not the judge  not the police  not the legislature  not the mayor  not the governor  not the President can tell us how to prosecute our cases. The decision to arraign Christopher and give him a criminal record was exclusively mine. I would choose whether to prosecute him for    felonies  for one felony  for a misdemeanor  or at all. I would choose whether to leverage Christopher into a plea deal or take the case to trial  and ultimately  I would be in a position to ask for Christopher to go to jail. These are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered  and we are unaware and untrained of the grave consequences of those decisions. One night this past summer  I was at a small gathering of professional men of color from around the city. As I stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth  as you do as public servant    I noticed across the room  a young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me. And I recognized him  but I couldn't place from where  and before I knew it  this young man was hugging me. And thanking me.  You cared about me  and you changed my life.  It was Christopher. See  I never arraigned Christopher. He never faced a judge or a jail  he never had a criminal record. Instead  I worked with Christopher  first on being accountable for his actions  and then  putting him in a position where he wouldn't re offend. We recovered    percent of the computers that he sold and gave them back to Best Buy  and came up with a financial plan to repay for the computers we couldn't recover. Christopher did community service. He wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future and that of the community. He applied to college  he obtained financial aid  and he went on to graduate from a four year school. After we finished hugging  I looked at his name tag  to learn that Christopher was the manager of a large bank in Boston. Christopher had accomplished    and making a lot more money than me    He had accomplished all of this in the six years since I had first seen him in Roxbury Court. I can't take credit for Christopher's journey to success  but I certainly did my part to keep him on the path. There are thousands of Christophers out there  some locked in our jails and prisons. We need thousands of prosecutors to recognize that and to protect them. An employed Christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one. It's a bigger win for all of us. In retrospect  the decision not to throw the book at Christopher makes perfect sense. When I saw him that first day in Roxbury Court  I didn't see a criminal standing there. I saw myself    a young person in need of intervention. As an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens  I knew firsthand the power of opportunity as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system. Along the way  with the help and guidance of my district attorney  my supervisor and judges  I learned the power of the prosecutor to change lives instead of ruining them. And that's how we do it in Boston. We helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids get a job. Instead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail for punching another teenager  we secured mental health treatment and community supervision. A runaway girl who was arrested for prostituting  to survive on the streets  needed a safe place to live and grow    something we could help her with. I even helped a young man who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school  that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack  he put a loaded   millimeter. We would spend our time that we'd normally take prepping our cases for months and months for trial down the road by coming up with real solutions to the problems as they presented. Which is the better way to spend our time  How would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs  Why are we spending    billion dollars on a prison industry that we know is failing  when we could take that money and reallocate it into education  into mental health treatment  into substance abuse treatment and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods  So why should this matter to you  Well  one  we're spending a lot of money. Our money. It costs         dollars in some states to lock up a teenager for a year  with a    percent chance that that person will return to the very same system. That is a terrible return on investment. Number two  it's the right thing to do. If prosecutors were a part of creating the problem  it's incumbent on us to create a solution and we can do that using other disciplines that have already done the data and research for us. And number three  your voice and your vote can make that happen. The next time there's a local district attorney's election in your jurisdiction  ask candidates these questions. One  What are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer  Two  What data are you collecting  and how are you training your prosecutors to make sure that it's working  And number three  If it's not working for everybody  what are you doing to fix it  If they can't answer the questions  they shouldn't be doing the job. Each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk is a living  breathing example of the power of opportunity  of intervention  of support and of love. While each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline for whatever malfeasances you committed  barely any of you needed a day in jail to make you the people that you are today    some of the greatest minds on the planet. Every day  thousands of times a day  prosecutors around the United States wield power so great that it can bring about catastrophe as quickly as it can bring about opportunity  intervention  support and yes  even love. Those qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community  and a strong community is a safe one. If our communities are broken  don't let the lawyers that you elect fix them with outdated  inefficient  expensive methods. Demand more  vote for the prosecutor who's helping people stay out of jail  not putting them in. Demand better. You deserve it  your children deserve it  the people who are tied up in the system deserve it  but most of all  the people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it. We must  we must do better. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. People returning to work after a career break  I call them relaunchers. These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care  for childcare reasons  pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue. Closely related are career transitioners of all kinds  veterans  military spouses  retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats. Returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers. Employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume as a high risk proposition  and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers  especially if they've been out for a long time. This disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve. Now  successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field. This is Sami Kafala. He's a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five year career break to be home with his five children. The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks. And speaking of long career breaks  this is Mimi Kahn. She's a social worker in Orange County  California  who returned to work in a social services organization after a    year career break. That's the longest career break that I'm aware of. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor took a five year career break early in her career. And this is Tracy Shapiro  who took a    year career break. Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it. Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home  but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work  plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working. Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search. She was looking for a finance or accounting role  and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results. I met Tracy in June of       when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around. The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house. I told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work. I also told her   You are going to have a lot of conversations that don't go anywhere. Expect that  and don't be discouraged by it. There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity.  I'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit  but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of    years out of the full time workforce. And that is  that people's view of you is frozen in time. What I mean by this is  when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past  the people with whom you worked or went to school  they are going to remember you as you were before your career break. And that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time  as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities. So for example  you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this. This is me  crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan. Or here I am in the kitchen. But those people from the past  they don't know about any of this. They only remember you as you were  and it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work. There's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break. And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news. My background is in finance  and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children. So I was afraid I'd go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore. So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again. I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce  and here's why. Think about our life stage  for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons  we have fewer or no maternity leaves. We did that already. We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations. We're in a more settled time of life. We have great work experience. We have a more mature perspective. We're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense. Plus we have an energy  an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we've been away from it for a while. On the flip side  I speak with employers  and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers. The first one is  employers are worried that relaunchers are technologically obsolete. Now  I can tell you  having been technologically obsolete myself at one point  that it's a temporary condition. I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used Lotus      . I don't know if anyone can even remember back that far  but I had to relearn it on Excel. It actually wasn't that hard. A lot of the commands are the same. I found PowerPoint much more challenging  but now I use PowerPoint all the time. I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software. And if they're not up to speed  then it's their responsibility to get there. And they do. The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers is they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do. I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break. That's not the employer's job. It's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value. Back in      I started noticing something. I had been tracking return to work programs since       and in       I started noticing the use of a short term paid work opportunity  whether it was called an internship or not  but an internship like experience  as a way for professionals to return to work. I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs. I saw a returning engineer  a nontraditional reentry candidate  apply for an entry level internship program in the military  and then get a permanent job afterward. I saw two universities integrate internships into mid career executive education programs. So I wrote a report about what I was seeing  and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called  The    Year Old Intern.  I have to thank the editors there for that title  and also for this artwork where you can see the    year old intern in the midst of all the college interns. And then  courtesy of Fox Business News  they called the concept  The    Year Old Intern.  So five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals. And at this point  hundreds of people have participated. These internships are paid  and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries. And now  seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers. Now  why are companies embracing the reentry internship  Because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews  and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over. This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers  and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires. Think about how far we have come. Before this  most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all. But now  not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind  but you can't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your r sum . This is the mark of real change  of true institutional shift  because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers  we can solve it for other career transitioners too. In fact  an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program. And there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program. Different pool  same concept. So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro. Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work. Well  one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy  and it was an accounting job in a finance department. But it was a temp job. The company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more  but no guarantees. This was in the fall of     . Tracy loved this company  and she loved the people and the office was less than    minutes from her house. So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full time role  she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best. Well  she ended up blowing away all of their expectations  and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of       but they made it even more interesting and challenging  because they knew what Tracy could handle. Fast forward to       Tracy's been promoted. They've paid for her to get her MBA at night. She's even hired another relauncher to work for her. Tracy's temp job was a tryout  just like an internship  and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer. Now  my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers. But in the meantime  if you are returning to work after a career break  don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program. Be their first success story  and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come. Thank you. So  this is a story about how we know what we know. It's a story about this woman  Natalia Rybczynski. She's a paleobiologist  which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff. Latif Nasser  And I think she's particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up  way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra. Now  one summer day in       she was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed  which is less than    degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole. because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil. LN  And at some point  she noticed something. about the size of the palm of my hand. It was just lying on the surface. LN  And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood  because that's the sort of thing people had found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before    prehistoric plant parts. But that night  back at camp ... I'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn't quite look like this has tree rings. Maybe it's a preservation thing  but it looks really like ... bone. LN  Huh. So over the next four years  she went to that spot over and over  and eventually collected    fragments of that exact same bone  most of them really tiny. LN  And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle. But it was challenging. I'm trying to use sand and putty  and it's not looking good. So finally  we used a  D surface scanner. LN  Ooh  NR  Yeah  right  LN  It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually. LN  How certain were you that you had it right  that you had put it together in the right way  Was there a potential that you'd put it together a different way and have  like  a parakeet or something  LN  What she had  she discovered  was a tibia  a leg bone  and specifically  one that belonged to a cloven hoofed mammal  so something like a cow or a sheep. But it couldn't have been either of those. It was just too big. LN  So what animal could it be  Having hit a wall  she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in Colorado  and they had an idea. and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it. LN  It smelled kind of like singed flesh. It was a smell that Natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab  collagen. Collagen is what gives structure to our bones. And usually  after so many years  it breaks down. But in this case  the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it. Then a year or two later  Natalia was at a conference in Bristol  and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley was demoing this new process that he called  collagen fingerprinting.  It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen  so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone  you can compare it to those of known species  and  who knows  maybe you get a match. So she shipped him one of the fragments  FedEx. LN  And he processed it  and compared it to    known and modern day mammal species. And he found a match. It turns out that the  .  million year old bone that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic belonged to ... a camel. LN  So they tested a bunch of the fragments  and they got the same result for each one. However  based on the size of the bone that they found  it meant that this camel was    percent larger than modern day camels. So this camel would have been about nine feet tall  weighed around a ton. Yeah. Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel. Now  when you hear the word  camel   what may come to mind is one of these  the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia. But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these  the dromedary  quintessential desert creature    hangs out in sandy  hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara  has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks  has big  broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes. So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic  Well  scientists have known for a long time  turns out  even before Natalia's discovery  that camels are actually originally American. They started here. For nearly    of the    million years that camels have been around  you could only find them in North America  around    different species  maybe more. NR  Yeah  you're going to have different body sizes. You'll have some with really long necks  so they're actually functionally like giraffes. LN  Some had snouts  like crocodiles. almost like rabbits. LN  What  Rabbit sized camels  So those ones you probably would not recognize. LN  Oh my God  I want a pet rabbit camel. LN  And then about three to seven million years ago  one branch of camels went down to South America  where they became llamas and alpacas  and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa. And then around the end of the last ice age  North American camels went extinct. So  scientists knew all of that already  but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north. Like  this is  temperature wise  the polar opposite of the Sahara. Now to be fair  three and a half million years ago  it was on average    degrees Celsius warmer than it is now. So it would have been boreal forest  so more like the Yukon or Siberia today. But still  like  they would have six month long winters where the ponds would freeze over. You'd have blizzards. You'd have    hours a day of straight darkness. Like  how ... How  How is it that one of these Saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions  Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer. And it's kind of brilliant. What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well suited to places like the Sahara  actually evolved to help it get through the winter  What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand  but over snow  like a pair of snowshoes  What if that hump    which  huge news to me  does not contain water  it contains fat    was there to help the camel get through that six month long winter  when food was scarce  And then  only later  long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment  Like  for instance  the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place  like a  you know  fat backpack  means that you don't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body. So it helps heat dissipate easier. It's this crazy idea  that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past. Now  I'm not the first person to tell this story. Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change. But I love it for a totally different reason. For me  it's a story about us  about how we see the world and about how that changes. So I was trained as a historian. And I've learned that  actually  a lot of scientists are historians  too. They make sense of the past. They tell the history of our universe  of our planet  of life on this planet. And as a historian  you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes. like the camel in the desert  right  That's a great story  It's totally adapted for that. Clearly  it always lived there. LN  But at any moment  you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence. You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew. Like  in this case  this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought was wood  and because of that  science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory about why this absurd Dr. Seuss looking creature looks the way it does. And for me  it completely upended the way I think of the camel. It went from being this ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment  to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara  and could end up virtually anywhere. This is Azuri. Azuri  hi  how are you doing  OK  here  I've got one of these for you here. So Azuri is on a break from her regular gig at the Radio City Music Hall. That's not even a joke. Anyway    But really  Azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is a dynamic one. It requires our willingness to readjust  to reimagine. Right  Azuri  And  really  that we're all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew. Thank you very much. It began with one question  If Africa was a bar  what would your country be drinking or doing  I kicked it off with a guess about South Africa  which wasn't exactly according to the rules because South Africa's not my country. But alluding to the country's continual attempts to build a postracial society after being ravaged for decades by apartheid  I tweeted   ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach. And then I waited. And then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line. So  I sent out a few other tweets about my own country and a few other African countries I'm familiar with. And then I waited again  but this time I read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted to convince myself  no  to remind myself that I'm really funny and that if nobody gets it  that's fine. But luckily  I didn't have to do that for very long. Very soon  people were participating. In fact  by the end of that week in July  the hashtag  ifafricawasabar would have garnered around        tweets  lit up the continent and made its way to publications all over the world. People were using the hashtag to do many different things. To poke fun at their stereotypes    IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining that he will pay the entrance fee  all he needs is the bouncer's account details.  To criticize government spending    ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce running a tab it won't be able to pay  To make light of geopolitical tensions    IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy with serious anger management issues.  To remind us that even in Africa there are some countries we don't know exist    IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person who nobody really knows but is always in the pictures.  And also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa    IfAfricaWasABar Egypt  Libya  Tunisia  Algeria and Morocco be like  What the hell are we doing here      And to note the countries that had made a big turnaround    ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl that comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk  happy and rich  But most importantly  people were using the hashtag to connect. People were connecting over their Africanness. So for one week in July  Twitter became a real African bar. And I was really thrilled  mainly because I realized that Pan Africanism could work  that we had before us  between us  at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other. My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa  I'm    years old and I am Pan Africanist by birth. Now  I say I'm Pan Africanist by birth because my parents are from two different African countries. My father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa. It's only slightly bigger than Germany. This year we celebrate our   th year of stable democracy. And it has some very progressive social policies. My mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland. It's a very  very small country  also in southern Africa. It is Africa's last complete monarchy. So it's been ruled by a king and a royal family in line with their tradition  for a very long time. On paper  these countries seem very different. And when I was a kid  I could see the difference. It rained a lot in one country  it didn't rain quite as much in the other. But outside of that  I didn't really realize why it mattered that my parents were from two different places. But it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me. You see  I was born in one country and raised in the other. When we moved to Botswana  I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati and nothing else. So I was being introduced to my new home  my new cultural identity  as a complete outsider  incapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me by the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward. But very soon  I would shed SiSwati. And when I would go back to Swaziland  I would be constantly confronted by how very non Swazi I was becoming. Add to that my entry into Africa's private school system  whose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you  and I would have a very peculiar adolescence. But I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here  in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once but not really belonging to either one very well and belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously. I became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity. Since then  I have continued to read about politics and geography and identity and what all those things mean. I've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies. When I began to read  I gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon  who tackled complex ideas like decolonization and black consciousness. And when I thought  at     that I had digested these grand ideas  I moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Congo's Patrice Lumumba. I read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on. So when Twitter came  I hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl whose friends are super  super bored of hearing about all this random stuff. The year was      and all over southern Africa and the whole continent  affordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing became much easier to get. So my generation  we were sending messages to each other on this platform that just needed     characters and a little bit of creativity. On long commutes to work  in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to  on our lunch breaks  we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realities of being young and African. But of course  this luxury was not available to everybody. So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana and you wanted to have fun on the Internet  one  you had to tweet in English. Two  you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online. You had to follow South Africans  Zimbabweans  Ghanaians  Nigerians. And suddenly  your whole world opened up. And my whole world did open up. I followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent  taking pictures of themselves and posting them under the hashtag  myafrica. Because at that time  if you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google or any kind of social media  you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts. But Africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors. It was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria. It was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi. And these were the same Africans that I began to meet in my own travels around the continent. We would discuss African literature  politics  economic policy. But almost invariably  every single time  we would end up discussing Twitter. And that's when I realized what this was. We were standing in the middle of something amazing  because for the first time ever young Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time  without the restriction of borders  finances and watchful governments. Because the little known truth is many Africans know a lot less about other African countries than some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole. This is by accident  but sometimes  it's by design. For example  in apartheid South Africa  black South Africans were constantly being bombarded with this message that any country ruled by black people was destined for failure. And this was done to convince them that they were much better off under crushing white rule than they were living in a black and free nation. Add to that Africa's colonial  archaic education system  which has been unthinkingly carried over from the     s    and at the age of     I could name all the various causes of the wars that had happened in Europe in the past     years  but I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country. And to me  this doesn't make any sense because whether we like it or not  the fates of African people are deeply intertwined. When disaster hits  when turmoil hits  we share the consequences. When Burundians flee political turmoil  they go to us  to other African countries. Africa has six of the world's largest refugee centers. What was once a Burundian problem becomes an African problem. So to me  there are no Sudanese problems or South African problems or Kenyan problems  only African problems because eventually  we share the turmoil. So if we share the problems  why aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes  How can we do that  Well  in the long term  we can shoot towards increasing inter African trade  removing borders and putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreements they've already signed. But I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes is to foster something I like to call social Pan Africanism. Now  political Pan Africanism already exists  so I'm not inventing anything totally new here. But political Pan Africanism is usually the African unity of the political elite. And who does that benefit  Well  African leaders  almost exclusively. No  what I'm talking about is the Pan Africanism of the ordinary African. Young Africans like me  we are bursting with creative energy  with innovative ideas. But with bad governance and shaky institutions  all of this potential could go to waste. On a continent where more than a handful of leaders have been in power longer than the majority of the populations has been alive  we are in desperate need of something new  something that works. And I think that thing is social Pan Africanism. My dream is that young Africans stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation. My dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant  they don't say   Well  this wouldn't work in my country   and then give up. My dream is that young Africans begin to realize that the entire continent is our canvas  is our home. Using the Internet  we can begin to think collaboratively  we can begin to innovate together. In Africa  we say   If you want to go fast  you go alone  but if you want to go far  you go together.  And I believe that social Pan Africanism is how we can go far together. And this is already happening. Access to these online networks has given young Africans something we've always had to violently take  a voice. We now have a platform. Before now  if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa  you waited for the    year old minister of youth    to wake up in the morning  take his heartburn medication and then tell you the plans he has for your generation in    years time. Before now  if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government  you were pushed to protest  suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some Western paper somewhere might make someone care. But now we have opportunities to back each other up in ways we never could before. We support South African students who are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees. We support Zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament. We support Angolan journalists who are being illegally detained. For the first time ever  African pain and African aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most  other Africans. I believe that with a social Pan Africanist thinking and using the Internet as a tool  we can begin to rescue each other  and ultimately  to rescue ourselves. Thank you. Thousands of years from now  we'll look back at the first century of computing as a fascinating but very peculiar time    the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in  D space  interacting with technology as if we were machines  a singular      year period in the vastness of time where humans communicated  were entertained and managed their lives from behind a screen. Today  we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens. What happened to interacting with each other  I don't know about you  but I feel limited inside this  D world of monitors and pixels. And it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people that inspires me as a creator. Put simply  I want to create a new reality  a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other  a reality where people  not devices  are the center of everything. I dream of a reality where technology senses what we see  touch and feel  a reality where technology no longer gets in our way  but instead embraces who we are. I dream of technology on a human path. We have all experienced technology that enables people to act more like people  products that enable natural interactions  voice controls or biometrics. This is the next step in the evolution. This is Microsoft HoloLens  the first fully untethered holographic computer. Devices like this will bring  D holographic content right into our world  enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions. Now  I'm not thinking about a distant future. I'm talking about today. We are already seeing car companies like Volvo designing cars differently with HoloLens  universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn  and my personal favorite  NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets holographically. Now  this is important. By bringing holograms into our world  I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer. I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the  D confines of traditional computing. Put it this way  temporally adjusted  we're like cave people in computer terms. We've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave. Now  this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day. And now for the next few minutes  I invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us. Now  as I put this HoloLens on  let me explain the setup a little bit. It's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage with HoloLens  and I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED. Momentarily  I am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage  just as clearly as I can see all of you. Now at the same time  we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors. So let's start our journey. And what better place to begin our journey  than in the computer cave of  D. Let's explore the world all around us with this new lens  and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective. The computer universe is both marvelous and primitive. It's a universe based on causality. As developers  we dream the different causes and then we program the different effects. Double click on an icon  that's a cause. Open an application  that's an effect. Now when we compare this to our physical universe  it is overly constraining  because our universe is not digital. Our universe is analog. Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one  true or false  or black or white. We exist in a world governed by quantum physics  a universe of zero and one both at the same time  a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray. You can see how these two worlds collide. So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life  We see screens from the moment we wake up  to the moment we fall asleep. Why  I think it's because computers give us superpowers. Within the digital universe  we have the power to displace space and the power to displace time. It doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment  productivity or communication. Think of it this way  let's all go home tonight and watch our favorite show on television. This is theater    time and space displaced. As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk  I'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle. That's displacement of space. Now  these are such great superpowers that we put up with the two dimensional limitations of our current digital world. But what if we didn't have to  What if we could have these same digital powers in our world  You can already see glimmers of this  but I believe our children's children will grow up in a world devoid of  D technology. It's remarkable to dream of this world  a world where technology truly understands us    where we live  work and communicate    with tools that enhance the human experience  not machines that limit our humanity. So how do we get there  For me  the answer required looking at the problem from a different perspective. It required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine. If you're a machine trying to sense our world  how would you actually break the problem down  You'd probably try to classify things as a human  an environment or an object. But how would that machine then interact with reality  And I can think of three ways. First  as a machine  I would observe or I would input reality. Speech recognition and biometric authentication are great examples of a machine interacting with humans from an input perspective. Secondly  as a machine  I could place digital information  or output information  into reality. Holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment from an output perspective. Finally  as a machine  I could exchange energy with the world via haptics. Now  imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object  or better yet  imagine pushing a hologram and having it push you back with equal force. With this perspective  we are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix. Now here's a secret  as an engineer  I get really excited anytime I can reduce something to the matrix. From self driving cars to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head  machines are becoming capable of understanding our world. And they are starting to interact with us in significantly more personal ways. Now  imagine having granular control over everything in the world. Move the dial one way  and you get reality. Move the dial the other way  and you get virtual reality. Now  imagine dialing your entire environment between virtual and real worlds. I love it down here. Now  imagine if I could look at all of you and dial from real humans into elves. When technology truly understands our world  it will again transform the ways we interact  the ways we work and the ways we play. Less than half a century ago  two courageous men landed on the moon  using computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets. Six hundred million humans watched them on grainy  black and white televisions. And the world  The world was mesmerized. Now imagine how our children and their children will experience the continued exploration of space with technology that understands this world. We already live in a world where real time universal translators exist. And I can squint  and I can already see holographic telepresence in our near future. In fact  since we've been lucky with our demo so far  let's try doing something else even more crazy. I invite you to experience  for the first time anywhere in the world  here on the TED stage  a real life holographic teleportation  between me and my friend  Dr. Jeffrey Norris  from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Finger crossed. Hi  Jeff. Jeff Norris  Hey  Alex. Alex Kipman  Phew  That worked. How are you doing today  Jeff  JN  Doing great. I had an awesome week. AK  So  can you tell us a little bit  Jeff  about where you are  JN  Well  I'm actually in three places. I'm standing in a room across the street  while I'm standing on this stage with you  while I'm standing on Mars  a hundred million miles away. AK  Wow  a hundred million miles away. This is crazy  Can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data from Mars is coming from  JN  Absolutely. This is a precise holographic replica of Mars  built from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover  that I can explore as easily as a place on Earth. Humans are natural explorers. We can instantly understand an environment  just by being present in it. We've built tools like our Mars Rover to extend our vision and lengthen our reach. But for decades  we've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards. Now  we're leaping over all of that  over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there. Today  a group of scientists on our mission are seeing Mars as never before    an alien world made a little more familiar  because they're finally exploring it as humans should. But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there. When we dial this real world to the virtual  we can do magical things. We can see in invisible wavelengths or teleport to the top of a mountain. Perhaps someday  we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it. We're taking the first steps. But we want the whole world to join us in taking the next  because this is not a journey for a few  but for all of us. AK  Thank you Jeff  this was amazing. Thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today. JN  Thank you Alex  bye bye. AK  Bye  Jeff. I dream about this future every single day. I take inspiration from our ancestors. We used to live in tribes where we interacted  communicated and worked together. We are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today    technology that will let us stop living inside this  D world of monitors and pixels  and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our  D world. It's a phenomenal time to be human. Thank you. Helen Walters  Thanks so much. I have some questions. AK  OK. HW  So there's been some talk in the press. And I'll just ask you straight  then we have a straight answer. There's been talk about the difference between the demos and the reality of the commercial product. Talk about this field of view issue. Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get  AK  It's a great question  Or  said better  this is a question we've been receiving in the media for possibly the last year. If you do your research  I haven't answered that question. I've purposely ignored it  because ultimately  it's the wrong question to ask. That's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time  and you then saying   What's the size of your television   The field of view for the product is almost irrelevant. What we should be talking about is the density of lights  or radiance  that shows up. Better said  what the angular resolution is of the things that you see. So from that perspective  what you saw    you know  the camera is wearing a HoloLens. So even if I wanted to cheat  I can't. HW  But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right  AK  The camera has a fish eye lens on it. It's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is. So if you think about the points of light that show up radially from the vision of the camera  which is the thing that matters  how many points of light can I get in a given volume  That's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one. Now  this camera sees a much wider view of the world  right  HW  Jesus Christ  AK  He did show up  I told you he'd show up. Come this way. HW  Oh  shit. AK  And there's holographic Jeff Norris. HW  I knew something was happening  but I really wasn't sure what. AK  So in short  to be super crisp  the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye. But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see  the points of light per unit of area  are actually the same. HW  So you spent    Jeff  I'll get to you in a minute    so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage    AK  That's right. HW  So help me out here  if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home  I don't need to map my apartment  right  AK  The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second  with this technology that we call spatial mapping. So in your home  as soon as you put it on  holograms will start showing up  and you'll start placing them and they'll start learning your home. In a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head to communicate with something over there with all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down  we don't take the risk of trying to do this live. So what we do is pre map the stage at five frames per second with the same spatial mapping technology that you'll use with the product at home  and then we store it  so that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this  between the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head  we don't have things disappear. Because ultimately  the holograms are coming from this HoloLens  and that one is just viewing the HoloLens. So if I lose connectivity  you would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen. HW  And it was beautiful. Um ... Jeff  JN  Yes  HW  Hi. AK  I'll take a step back. HW  So Jeff  you were on Mars  you were here  you were in a room across the street. Tell me more about the fact that  with holograms  you have sight but you don't have touch  you don't have smell. Is this scientifically useful now  That's my question for a hologram. JN  Thanks for the question. Absolutely  I believe that these technologies are scientifically useful right now  and that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA. So we're using it to improve the ways that we explore Mars. We're also using it for our astronauts on the space station. We're even using it now to design the next generation of our spacecraft. HW  Amazing. OK  Jeff  please go away. Thank you very much. Alex  really  that was amazing. Thank you so much. AK  Thank you. HW  Thank you. Thank you. It has been     years since the last country in the world abolished slavery and    years since Martin Luther King pronounced his  I Have A Dream  speech. But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression  but a lasting one that remains. I was born in a family full of colors. My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone. He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents. The matriarch  my grandma  has a porcelain skin and cotton like hair. My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone  like my uncle and my cousin. My mother is a cinnamon skin daughter of a native Brazilian  with a pinch of hazel and honey  and a man  who is  a mix of coffee with milk  but with a lot of coffee. She has two sisters. One in a toasted peanut skin and the other  also adopted  more on the beige side  like a pancake. Growing up in this family  color was never important for me. Outside home  however  things were different soon. Color had many other meanings. I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings. It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh colored pencil. I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink. My skin was brown  and people said I was black. I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head. Later  when I took my cousin to school  I was usually taken for the nanny. By helping in the kitchen at a friend's party  people thought I was the maid. I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends. And many times  visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings  I was invited not to use the main elevator. Because in the end  with this color and this hair  I cannot belong to some places. In some way  I get to used to it and accept part of it. However  something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling. Years later I married a Spaniard. But not any Spaniard. I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt. Since then  a new question started to chase me. What will be the color of your children  As you can understand  this is my last concern. But thinking about it  with my previous background  my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer. And that is how Humanae was born. Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors  rather than the untrue white  red  black or yellow associated with race. It's a kind of game to question our codes. It's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history. I portray the subjects in a white background. Then I choose an    pixel square from the nose  paint the background  and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette  Pantone. I started with my family and friends  then more and more people joined the adventure  thanks to public calls coming through the social media. I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain. The snowball started to roll. The project had a great welcome    invitations  exhibitions  physical formats  galleries and museums ... just happened. And among them  my favorite  when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street  it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community. I have portrayed more than       people in    different countries     different cities around the world. Just to mention some of them    from someone included in the Forbes list  to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat. In Paris  from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter. And students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro. All kinds of beliefs  gender identities or physical impairments  a newborn or terminally ill. We all together build Humanae. Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other. When modern science is questioning the race concept  what does it mean for us to be black  white  yellow  red  Is it the eye  the nose  the mouth  the hair  Or does it have to do with our origin  nationality or bank account  This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery. Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people. It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label. It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me. I have hundreds of that  I will share with you  too. A mother of    years    A mother of an    year old girl wrote me   Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence  as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway. So your work has a very special place in my heart and it's very important for me.  A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote   All my life  people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group  a stereotype  a box. Perhaps we should stop. Instead of framing  ask the individual  'How would you label yourself ' Then I would say  'Hi. I'm Massiel. I'm a Dominican Dutch  I grew up in a mixed family and I'm a bisexual woman.'   Besides these unexpected and touching reactions  Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields. Just to show you some examples  illustrators and art students using it as a reference for their sketches and their studies. It's a collection of faces. Researchers in the fields of anthropology  physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity  optophysiology  face recognition or Alzheimer's. One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs  one of the most relevant political publications. And talking about foreign affairs  I found the perfect ambassadors for my project ... teachers. They are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes. Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes  but this time as a teacher myself. My students  both adults and kids  paint their self portraits  trying to discover their own unique color. As a photographer  I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate. As an individual  as Ang lica  every time I take a picture  I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist. All the frustration  fear and loneliness that I once felt ... becomes love. The last country    the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born  Brazil. We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination. That remains a common practice worldwide  and that will not disappear by itself. Thank you. Thank you. OK  so  confession  I've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising. I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons  paying more attention to the commercials than to the shows  trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head. Ultimately  that led me to my dream job. I became a partner at a big New York ad agency. But then  all of that suddenly changed on February           when my little brother Matt was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Suddenly  my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare  being told that my brother was going to die  actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him  then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted  for Matt  to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury. He is definitely my hero. But as much as  Applause     yeah  deserves it    But as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family  I often think about how much worse it could have been  in fact  how much worse it is for the    families every day who aren't as fortunate  who lose loved ones    brothers  sisters  sons  daughters  parents. They don't all make national headlines. In fact  most of them don't. They go largely unnoticed  in a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic as some kind of new normal. So I quit my job in advertising to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic  because I came to realize that the challenges to preventing gun violence are actually the same ones that made me love advertising  which is to try to figure out how to engage people. Only instead of doing it to sell products  doing it to save lives. And that comes down to finding common ground  where what I want overlaps with what you want. And you might be surprised to learn  when it comes to gun violence  just how much common ground there is. Let's look  for example  at people who love to hunt  a sport enjoyed by millions across the US. It's a proud tradition. Families. In some places  the first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday. What do hunters want  Well  they want to hunt. They love their guns. They believe deeply in the Second Amendment right to own those guns. But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground. In fact  there's a lot of it  starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands. This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people. It's about keeping all guns away from certain people  and it's the people that  it turns out  we all agree shouldn't have guns  convicted violent criminals  domestic abusers  the dangerously mentally ill. We can all appreciate how Brady background checks have been incredibly effective in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands. In    years  Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers have blocked  .  million gun sales to those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns. And whether you love guns or hate guns  you probably also appreciate that there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day at guns shows or online without those Brady background checks  just like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane    one with security and one with no security. And    And the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public     percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales    including    percent of Republicans  more than    percent of gun owners  more than    percent of NRA members. This is not a controversial idea. In fact  only six percent of the American public disagrees. That's about the percentage of the American public that believes the moon landing was a fake. And it's also about the percentage that believes the government is putting mind controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals. That's the extent to which we agree about background checks. But what about the     million guns already out there in homes across America  Well first  it's important to realize that those guns are mostly in the hands and homes of decent  law abiding people like you and me  who want what we all want    including keeping our families safe. In fact  that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns. Ten years ago     percent of the American public believed    incorrectly    that a gun makes your home safer. Today  that number is    percent. Why  I kind of hate to say it  because it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising  which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times  eventually that lie becomes the truth. And that's exactly what's happened here. The corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars blocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic of gun violence  blocking pediatricians from talking to parents about the dangers of guns in the home  blocking smart gun technology and other technology that would prevent kids from firing parents' guns and would save lives. They're desperate to hide the truth  because they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line. And every day  people are dying as a result. And a lot of those people are children. Every day in the US  nine kids are just shot unintentionally.     children and teens take their own lives every year. And here's the thing  they're almost all with a parent's gun. Even two thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the home  including the terrible tragedy at Sandy Hook. I meet so many of these parents  it's the most heartbreaking part of my job. These are not bad people. They're just living with the unimaginable consequences of a very bad decision  made based on very bad information that was put into their minds by very bad people  who know good and well the misery that they're causing  but just don't care. And the result is a nightmare    not only for families like mine  but for  really  at the end of the day  all of us. But I'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence. I'm here to talk about our dream  and it's a dream we all share  which is the dream of a better  safer  future. For my organization  for the Brady Campaign  that dream is reflected in the bold goal to cut the number of gun deaths in the US in half by     . And I hope to leave all of you here tonight with a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach. Because folks  for every great movement around the world  there's a moment where you can look back and say   That's when things really started to change.  And I'm here to say that for the movement to end gun violence in America  that moment is here. We are so clearly at a tipping point  because the American public has come together by the millions like never before  based on that common ground  to say   Enough.  Enough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters and churches and schools. Enough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets that's claimed the lives of women and young black men in staggering proportions. Enough of easy access to guns by the people that we all agree shouldn't have them. And enough of a small group of craven politicians putting the interests of the corporate gun lobby ahead of the people they have been elected to represent. Enough. And the really exciting thing is  it's not just the usual suspects like me that are saying it anymore. It's so much bigger than that. And if you want proof  let's start where most conversations in the US seem to start    with Kim Kardashian. And here's the thing  it's not really a joke. I mean  think about when issues change. It's when they go from being political and advocacy issues to being part of pop culture  voices coming from everywhere  celebrities using their platforms  musicians  athletes. The NBA has come forward. Conservative pundits that you never would have imagined have come forward. There's real cultural change    I even hear there's a TED Talk about it this year. That's the extent to which this cultural change is happening. And yes  Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal to her    million Twitter followers for expanded background checks. Let's look at the political elections that are heating up. This used to be the classic third rail issue for Democrats. Couldn't run from it fast enough. Now candidates are running on it. Some are being forced to reverse very bad positions they defended very comfortably  until very recently. For somebody like me  watching people wave around their negative NRA ratings    it's almost surreal to watch. We're still outfunded  yes  by the corporate gun lobby  and ultimately that needs to change. But you know what  We're smarter and we're scrappier  and we have the truth on our side. And we're on offense. You know  they say that the Internet democratizes information. Social media and some of the organizing tools that plug into it have democratized activism. It's allowed us to show what    percent support really looks like. Sometimes I think of it    you know  we're converging and attacking instantly by the millions  kind of like white blood cells. It's enabled us to start to really close    and this is the bottom line    close that disgraceful disconnect between what the American public wants and what our elected leaders are doing about it. Until recently  the narrative in Congress was that calls from the other side  from that six percent  outnumbered calls from our side    to one. We're flipping that narrative on its head. After that recent terrible tragedy in San Bernardino  we jammed Congressional switchboards. We put        calls into Congress in    hours. And you know what  We got a vote on a bill that nobody thought was going to see the light of day anytime soon. We're seeing real movement to repeal some of the most evil  ugly gun lobby legislation passed over the last dark decade. The stranglehold of the gun lobby is clearly being broken. We've seen President Obama's historic executive actions. They don't go all the way  but they are going to save lives  because they expand Brady background checks to thousands of gun sales that didn't have them previously. And we're marching across the country    we're not just waiting for Congress to act  that would almost be the definition of insanity. We're marching across the country  state by state  marriage equality style. And you know what  We're winning. Congress is almost always the last to wake up and realize that it's on the wrong side of history. And when they do  it's always because the American public shakes them. And that's exactly what we're doing right now  as we're in this tipping point. You know  recently I was flying cross country to give a speech to a large group like this  although far less intimidating  and the woman sitting next to me happened to be binge watching one of my all time favorite TV shows   Mad Men   a period TV show about advertising in the     s. And as I was trying to think about how to end my remarks  I'd glance up at her screen every now and then  and it seemed that every time I did  I'd see somebody smoking in an office or around children or while pregnant or drinking and driving or driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a coworker. And ultimately it dawned on me  what tremendous inspiration to those of us who have this dream to end gun violence. I mean  think about how much the world has changed in a relatively short period of time  how all those behaviors that were once considered commonplace or normal    some even glamorous or sexy    have become stigmatized in just a generation or two  once they became conversations about our common ground. That is the magnitude of the change we have the potential to create around gun violence. And that's my dream  that maybe someday  some period TV show will depict the terrible nightmare of gun violence  and a future generation of children might only be able to imagine how terrible it must have been. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself that are hospitable to humans by any measure  but survive we have. Our primitive ancestors  when they found their homes and livelihood endangered  they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories in search of better opportunities. And as the descendants of these explorers  we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins. But at the same time  distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other  it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore. We  as a species  we're evolved uniquely for Earth  on Earth  and by Earth  and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent and just too busy to notice that its resources are finite  and that our Sun's life is also finite. While Mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel  few of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space. Let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check. So just a quick show of hands here  how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few days  Well  that's a lot of you. How about a few weeks  That's a decent amount. How about a few months  That's pretty good too. Now  let us imagine that this local national forest experiences an eternal winter. Same questions  how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days  That's quite a lot. How about a few weeks  So for a fun twist  let us imagine that the only source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface. Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found  and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of. Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet like Mars. So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation  Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth  Build space elevators  or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet  And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us  But I'm getting ahead of myself. In our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun  we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself  in space  on a ship  a hermetic flying can  possibly for many generations. The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of    to    months. From astronauts' experiences in space  we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss  muscle atrophy  cardiovascular problems  among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological. And what about macrogravity  or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on  In short  our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown. So far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology or that great next generation robot as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space. Wonderful as they are  I believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented  the microbe  a single celled organism that is itself a self generating  self replenishing  living machine. It requires fairly little to maintain  offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube. The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology. It comes from molecular biology  which has given us antibiotics  vaccines and better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body. Using the tools of synthetic biology  we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism  microscopic or not  with incredible speed and fidelity. Given the limitations of our man made machines  synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food  our fuel and our environment  but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space. To give you an example of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration  let us return to the Mars environment. The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash  with trace amounts of organic material. Let's say  hypothetically  what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth derived nutrients  The first question we should probably ask is  how would we make our plants cold tolerant  Because  on average  the temperature on Mars is a very uninviting negative    degrees centigrade. The next question we should ask is  how do we make our plants drought tolerant  Considering that most of the water that forms as frost evaporates more quickly than I can say the word  evaporate.  Well  it turns out we've already done things like this. By borrowing genes for anti freeze protein from fish and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them  we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes. They're known on Earth as GMOs  or genetically modified organisms  and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization. Nature does stuff like this already  without our help. We have simply found more precise ways to do it. So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space  Well  to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all. It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high cost cargo transport mission. One of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered to adapt to new and harsh environments. In essence  using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term. These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel. So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us  but what else can we do  Well  I mentioned earlier that we  as a species  were evolved uniquely for planet Earth. That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and I was standing there. And so  if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute  even given ample food  water  air and a suit  we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere. Unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet  we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight  or needing to hide behind a wall of lead. So let us appeal to nature for inspiration. Among the plethora of life here on Earth  there's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles  or lovers of extreme living conditions  if you'll remember from high school biology. And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans. It is known to be able to withstand cold  dehydration  vacuum  acid  and  most notably  radiation. While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known  we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals. To do so is not particularly easy. There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance  and it's not as simple as transferring one gene. But given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time  I think to do so is not very hard either. Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation  it would be infinitely better than what we already have  which is just the melanin in our skin. Using the tools of synthetic biology  we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation. As difficult as it is to see  homo sapiens  that is humans  evolves every day  and still continues to evolve. Thousands of years of human evolution has not only given us humans like Tibetans  who can thrive in low oxygen conditions  but also Argentinians  who can ingest and metabolize arsenic  the chemical element that can kill the average human being. Every day  the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations. But  and this is a big but  such evolution requires two things that we may not always have  or be able to afford  and they are death and time. In our species' struggle to find our place in the universe  we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on non Earth planets. We're living in what E.O. Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention  during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy with temporary external supplements. But with every passing day  we approach the age of volitional evolution  a time during which we as a species will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny. Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how  but of when. Using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms  especially our own  is not without its moral and ethical quandaries. Will engineering ourselves make us less human  But then again  what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious  Where should human genius direct itself  Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it. How do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers and then protect ourselves from ourselves  I pose these questions not to engender the fear of science but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us. We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution but also with courage. Mars is a destination  but it will not be our last. Our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence. Space is cold  brutal and unforgiving. Our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going. The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life itself  and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe. Thank you. Here are two reasons companies fail  they only do more of the same  or they only do what's new. To me the real  real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities  exploration and exploitation. Both are necessary  but it can be too much of a good thing. Consider Facit. I'm actually old enough to remember them. Facit was a fantastic company. They were born deep in the Swedish forest  and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world. Everybody used them. And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along  They continued doing exactly the same. In six months  they went from maximum revenue ... and they were gone. Gone. To me  the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers  who had bought cheap  small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double check their calculators. Facit did too much exploitation. But exploration can go wild  too. A few years back  I worked closely alongside a European biotech company. Let's call them OncoSearch. The company was brilliant. They had applications that promised to diagnose  even cure  certain forms of blood cancer. Every day was about creating something new. They were extremely innovative  and the mantra was   When we only get it right   or even   We want it perfect.  The sad thing is  before they became perfect    even good enough    they became obsolete. OncoSearch did too much exploration. I first heard about exploration and exploitation about    years ago  when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University. The founder of the idea is Jim March. And to me the power of the idea is its practicality. Exploration. Exploration is about coming up with what's new. It's about search  it's about discovery  it's about new products  it's about new innovations. It's about changing our frontiers. Our heroes are people who have done exploration  Madame Curie  Picasso  Neil Armstrong  Sir Edmund Hillary  etc. I come from Norway  all our heroes are explorers  and they deserve to be. We all know that exploration is risky. We don't know the answers  we don't know if we're going to find them  and we know that the risks are high. Exploitation is the opposite. Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good  better. Exploitation is about making our trains run on time. It's about making good products faster and cheaper. Exploitation is not risky    in the short term. But if we only exploit  it's very risky in the long term. And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again  until they become obsolete or even pathetic. That's the risk of exploitation. So if we take a long term perspective  we explore. If we take a short term perspective  we exploit. Small children  they explore all day. All day it's about exploration. As we grow older  we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on. The same goes for companies. Companies become  by nature  less innovative as they become more competent. And this is  of course  a big worry to CEOs. And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways. For example   How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company   Or   How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis   So  doing one well is difficult. Doing both well as the same time is art    pushing both exploration and exploitation. So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time  in parallel. But when they do  the payoffs are huge. So we have lots of great examples. We have Nestl  creating Nespresso  we have Lego going into animated films  Toyota creating the hybrids  Unilever pushing into sustainability    there are lots of examples  and the benefits are huge. Why is balancing so difficult  I think it's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are. So I'll talk about two  but there are many. So let's talk about the perpetual search trap. We discover something  but we don't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work. So instead of staying with it  we create something new. But the same goes for that  then we're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated. OncoSearch was a good example. A famous example is  of course  Xerox. But we don't only see this in companies. We see this in the public sector as well. We all know that any kind of effective reform of education  research  health care  even defense  takes         maybe    years to work. But still  we change much more often. We really don't give them the chance. Another trap is the success trap. Facit fell into the success trap. They literally held the future in their hands  but they couldn't see it. They were simply so good at making what they loved doing  that they wouldn't change. We are like that  too. When we know something well  it's difficult to change. Bill Gates has said   Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail.  That's the challenge with success. So I think there are some lessons  and I think they apply to us. And they apply to our companies. The first lesson is  get ahead of the crisis. And any company that's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future. Netflix    they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution  but they always    and I think they will always    keep pushing for the next battle. I see other companies that say   I'll win the next innovation cycle  whatever it takes.  Second one  think in multiple time scales. I'll share a chart with you  and I think it's a wonderful one. Any company we look at  taking a one year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company  innovation typically accounts for only about    percent. So when we think one year  innovation isn't really that important. Move ahead  take a    year perspective on the same company    suddenly  innovation and ability to renew account for    percent. But companies can't choose. They need to fund the journey and lead the long term. Third  invite talent. I don't think it's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves. I think it's a team sport. I think we need to allow challenging. I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged  and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge. I think that's also what good parenting is about. Last one  be skeptical of success. Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome  when the generals  after a big victory  were given their celebration. Riding into Rome on the carriage  they always had a companion whispering in their ear   Remember  you're only human.  So I hope I made the point  balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff. But it's difficult  and we need to be conscious. I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful. First question is  looking at your own company  In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps  of just going on autopilot  And what can you do to challenge  Second question is  When did I explore something new last  and what kind of effect did it have on me  Is that something I should do more of  In my case  yes. So let me leave you with this. Whether you're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know  don't forget  the beauty is in the balance. Thank you.
