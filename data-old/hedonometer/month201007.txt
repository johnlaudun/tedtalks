It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe  which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe. And so I think we can roll the video that we have.  The Himalayas.  The flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite  unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste. It wasn't until we really left Earth  got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself  that we could understand our planet as a limited condition. The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past    years. We maintain that  put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales. What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe  as we see. NASA supported this work    years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world. The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do    our main space shows in the dome. But what you see here is the result of  actually  internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden. I've had    students work on this for their graduate work  and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden. This software allows interactive use  so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live. I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan  where I live  and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology. And so as we move out  we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies  as we see here  light travel time  giving you a sense of how far away we are. As we move out  the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long  we're essentially backing up into the past. We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us    the afterglow of the Big Bang. This is the WMAP microwave background that we see. We'll fly outside it here  just to see this sort of containment. If we were outside this  it would almost be meaningless  in the sense as before time. But this our containment of the visible universe. We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see. Coming back quickly  we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning  but these are positions  the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped  and our sun here  obviously  with our own solar system. What you're going to see    we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system    these are the paths of Voyager    Voyager    Pioneer    and Pioneer     the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system. Coming in closer  picking up Earth  orbit of the Moon  and we see the Earth. This map can be updated  and we can add in new data. I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I. for the Cassini mission. But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases  ingeniously developed so that    encounters with the largest moon  Titan  which is larger that the planet Mercury  diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase. This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this. This software can also be networked between domes. We have a growing user base of this  and we network domes. And we can network between domes and classrooms. We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia. And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school. This is an image from Saturday  photographed by the Aqua satellite  but through the Uniview software. So you're seeing the edge of the Earth. This is Nepal. This is  in fact  right here is the valley of Lhasa  right here in Tibet. But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India. This is Nepal and Tibet. And just in closing  I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on    here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out    so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is. Because our home is the universe  and we are the universe  essentially. We carry that in us. And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all  I think  in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe. Thank you. Why grow homes  Because we can. Right now  America is in an unremitting state of trauma. And there's a cause for that  all right. We've got McPeople  McCars  McHouses. As an architect  I have to confront something like this. So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses  Well  it's been around for       years. It's called pleaching  or grafting trees together  or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous  vascular system. And we do something different than what we did in the past  we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that. We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi epithetic matter  plants  into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab. It fits into the environment. It is the environment. It is the landscape  right  And you can have a hundred million of these homes  and it's great because they suck carbon. They're perfect. You can have     million families  or take things out of the suburbs  because these are homes that are a part of the environment. Imagine pre growing a village    it takes about seven to    years    and everything is green. So not only do we do the veggie house  we also do the in vitro meat habitat  or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn  where  as an architecture office  we're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one. So we've been doing this for a couple of years  and that's our lab. And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs. We use a modified inkjet printer  and we print geometry. We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like  you know  shoes  leather belts  handbags  etc.  where no sentient creature is harmed. It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube. So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes. So here is a typical stud wall  an architectural construction  and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house  where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation  cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows. And we know it's incredibly ugly. It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial  but we kind of chose this shape. And there it is kind of grown  at least one particular section of it. We had a big show in Prague  and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat. That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much. Thank you very much. Please excuse me for sitting  I'm very old. Well  the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is  in a certain sense  very peculiar because it's very old. Roughness is part of human life forever and forever  and ancient authors have written about it. It was very much uncontrollable  and in a certain sense  it seemed to be the extreme of complexity  just a mess  a mess and a mess. There are many different kinds of mess. Now  in fact  by a complete fluke  I got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity  and to my utter amazement  I found traces    very strong traces  I must say    of order in that roughness. And so today  I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents. I prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity    to someone who had Latin in my long past youth    means the contrary of regularity. But it is not so. Regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough. So let me show you a few objects. Some of them are artificial. Others of them are very real  in a certain sense. Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower. Now why do I show a cauliflower  a very ordinary and ancient vegetable  Because old and ancient as it may be  it's very complicated and it's very simple  both at the same time. If you try to weigh it    of course it's very easy to weigh it  and when you eat it  the weight matters    but suppose you try to measure its surface. Well  it's very interesting. If you cut  with a sharp knife  one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately  you think of a whole cauliflower  but smaller. And then you cut again  again  again  again  again  again  again  again  again  and you still get small cauliflowers. So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property  that each part is like the whole  but smaller. Now  what did humanity do with that  Very  very little. So what I did actually is to study this problem  and I found something quite surprising. That one can measure roughness by a number  a number   .    .  and sometimes much more. One day  a friend of mine  to bug me  brought a picture and said   What is the roughness of this curve   I said   Well  just short of  . .  It was  .  . Now  it didn't take me any time. I've been looking at these things for so long. So these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces. I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial. They were done on a computer  and the only input is a number  and that number is roughness. So on the left  I took the roughness copied from many landscapes. To the right  I took a higher roughness. So the eye  after a while  can distinguish these two very well. Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness. This is very rough  and this is sort of smooth  and this perfectly smooth. Very few things are very smooth. So then if you try to ask questions   What's the surface of a cauliflower   Well  you measure and measure and measure. Each time you're closer  it gets bigger  down to very  very small distances. What's the length of the coastline of these lakes  The closer you measure  the longer it is. The concept of length of coastline  which seems to be so natural because it's given in many cases  is  in fact  complete fallacy  there's no such thing. You must do it differently. What good is that  to know these things  Well  surprisingly enough  it's good in many ways. To begin with  artificial landscapes  which I invented sort of  are used in cinema all the time. We see mountains in the distance. They may be mountains  but they may be just formulae  just cranked on. Now it's very easy to do. It used to be very time consuming  but now it's nothing. Now look at that. That's a real lung. Now a lung is something very strange. If you take this thing  you know very well it weighs very little. The volume of a lung is very small  but what about the area of the lung  Anatomists were arguing very much about that. Some say that a normal male's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball  court . And the others say  no  five basketball  courts . Enormous disagreements. Why so  Because  in fact  the area of the lung is something very ill defined. The bronchi branch  branch  branch and they stop branching  not because of any matter of principle  but because of physical considerations  the mucus  which is in the lung. So what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung  but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale  for a man and for a little rodent. Now  what good is it to have that  Well  surprisingly enough  amazingly enough  the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently. And I think that my mathematics  surprisingly enough  has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses  all these branching systems  for which there was no geometry. So I found myself  in other words  constructing a geometry  a geometry of things which had no geometry. And a surprising aspect of it is that very often  the rules of this geometry are extremely short. You have formulas that long. And you crank it several times. Sometimes repeatedly  again  again  again  the same repetition. And at the end  you get things like that. This cloud is completely      percent artificial. Well    . . And the only part which is natural is a number  the roughness of the cloud  which is taken from nature. Something so complicated like a cloud  so unstable  so varying  should have a simple rule behind it. Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds. The seer of clouds had to take account of it. I don't know how much advanced these pictures are. They're old. I was very much involved in it  but then turned my attention to other phenomena. Now  here is another thing which is rather interesting. One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics  which is not appreciated by many people  occurred about     years ago      years ago. Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist. Mathematicians got into self praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing  that man can invent things that nature did not know. In particular  it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane. A curve's a curve  a plane's a plane  and the two won't mix. Well  they do mix. A man named Peano did define such curves  and it became an object of extraordinary interest. It was very important  but mostly interesting because a kind of break  a separation between the mathematics coming from reality  on the one hand  and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind. Well  I was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has  in fact  seen at long last what had been seen for a long time. And so here I introduce something  the set of rivers of a plane filling curve. And well  it's a story unto itself. So it was in      to       an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world. And the objects which were used as examples  when I was a child and a student  as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality    those objects  I turned them completely around. I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature. Well  a man named Hausdorff in      introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke  and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness. When I first told it to my friends in mathematics they said   Don't be silly. It's just something  silly .  Well actually  I was not silly. The great painter Hokusai knew it very well. The things on the ground are algae. He did not know the mathematics  it didn't yet exist. And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West. But painting for a long time had a fractal side. I could speak of that for a long time. The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect. I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower  and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood. This is a mess  mess  mess  Brownian loop. One day I decided    halfway through my career  I was held by so many things in my work    I decided to test myself. Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new  Well  so I looked at these things called Brownian motion    just goes around. I played with it for a while  and I made it return to the origin. Then I was telling my assistant   I don't see anything. Can you paint it   So he painted it  which means he put inside everything. He said   Well  this thing came out ...  And I said   Stop  Stop  Stop  I see  it's an island.  And amazing. So Brownian motion  which happens to have a roughness number of two  goes around. I measured it   .  . Again  again  again. Long measurements  big Brownian motions   .  . Mathematical problem  how to prove it  It took my friends    years. Three of them were having incomplete proofs. They got together  and together they had the proof. So they got the big  Fields  medal in mathematics  one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which I've seen without being able to prove them. Now everybody asks me at one point or another   How did it all start  What got you in that strange business   What got you to be  at the same time  a mechanical engineer  a geographer and a mathematician and so on  a physicist  Well actually I started  oddly enough  studying stock market prices. And so here I had this theory  and I wrote books about it    financial prices increments. To the left you see data over a long period. To the right  on top  you see a theory which is very  very fashionable. It was very easy  and you can write many books very fast about it. There are thousands of books on that. Now compare that with real price increments. Where are real price increments  Well  these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did. So the idea there was that one must be able to    how do you say     model price variation. And it went really well    years ago. For    years  people were sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much  much easier. But I tell you  at this point  people listened to me. These two curves are averages  Standard   Poor  the blue one  and the red one is Standard   Poor's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out. Now discontinuities are a nuisance  so in many studies of prices  one puts them aside.  Well  acts of God. And you have the little nonsense which is left. Acts of God.  In this picture  five acts of God are as important as everything else. In other words  it is not acts of God that we should put aside. That is the meat  the problem. If you master these  you master price  and if you don't master these  you can master the little noise as well as you can  but it's not important. Well  here are the curves for it. Now  I get to the final thing  which is the set of which my name is attached. In a way  it's the story of my life. My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France. Since I thought that I might vanish within a day or a week  I had very big dreams. And after the war  I saw an uncle again. My uncle was a very prominent mathematician  and he told me   Look  there's a problem which I could not solve    years ago  and which nobody can solve. This is a construction of a man named  Gaston  Julia and  Pierre  Fatou. If you could find something new  anything  you will get your career made.  Very simple. So I looked  and like the thousands of people that had tried before  I found nothing. But then the computer came  and I decided to apply the computer  not to new problems in mathematics    like this wiggle wiggle  that's a new problem    but to old problems. And I went from what's called real numbers  which are points on a line  to imaginary  complex numbers  which are points on a plane  which is what one should do there  and this shape came out. This shape is of an extraordinary complication. The equation is hidden there  z goes into z squared  plus c. It's so simple  so dry. It's so uninteresting. Now you turn the crank once  twice  twice  marvels come out. I mean this comes out. I don't want to explain these things. This comes out. This comes out. Shapes which are of such complication  such harmony and such beauty. This comes out repeatedly  again  again  again. And that was one of my major discoveries  to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing  more or less. And then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place. All that from this little formula  which has whatever  five symbols in it. And then this one. The color was added for two reasons. First of all  because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers. And if you plot them  you must choose some system. And so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that  and others it is that or that. It's so complicated. In       I was in Cambridge  U.K. to receive a prize from the university  and three days later  a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing. So where did this come from  Obviously  from extraterrestrials. Well  so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that  discovery  and received the next day       letters from people saying   But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big.  Well  let me finish. This shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics. Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules  which are repeated without end. Thank you very much. I'm Ellen  and I'm totally obsessed with food. But I didn't start out obsessed with food. I started out obsessed with global security policy because I lived in New York during       and it was obviously a very relevant thing. And I got from global security policy to food because I realized when I'm hungry  I'm really pissed off  and I'm assuming that the rest of the world is too. Especially if you're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry  you're pretty angry. And actually  lo and behold  it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure. So I took a job at the United Nations World Food Programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues. And while I was there  I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs. It's called School Feeding  and it's a really simple idea to sort of get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger that continues for a lot of people around the world  and stop it. By giving kids a free school meal  it gets them into school  which is obviously education  the first step out of poverty  but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need to really develop both mentally and physically. While I was working at the U.N.  I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush. And she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the  Feed Bag     which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag. But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid. It's so simple  and we thought  you know  okay  it costs between    and    bucks to provide school feeding for a year. We could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and a ton of awareness for the World Food Programme. But of course  you know at the U.N.  sometimes things move slowly  and they basically said no. And we thought  God  this is such a good idea and it's going to raise so much money. So we said screw it  we'll just start our own company  which we did three years ago. So that was kind of my first dream  was to start this company called FEED  and here's a screenshot of our website. We did this bag for Haiti  and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in Haiti. So FEED's doing great. We've so far provided    million meals to kids around the world by selling now         bags  a ton of bags  a lot of bags. All this time you're    when you think about hunger  it's a hard thing to think about  because what we think about is eating. I think about eating a lot  and I really love it. And the thing that's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know   What are you doing in America    What are you doing for America's kids   There's definitely hunger in America     million people and almost   .  million children. I mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country. Hunger definitely means something a little bit different in America than it does internationally  but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country. But obviously the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity  and it's dramatic. The other thing that's dramatic is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last    years. Unfortunately  obesity's not only an American problem. It's actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting. The numbers are pretty crazy. There's a billion people obese or overweight and a billion people hungry. So those seem like two bifurcated problems  but I kind of started to think about  you know  what is obesity and hunger  What are both those things about  Well  they're both about food. And when you think about food  the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture. And agriculture is where food comes from. Well  agriculture in America's very interesting. It's very consolidated  and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat. Well  the foods that are produced are  more or less  corn  soy and wheat. And as you can see  that's three quarters of the food that we're eating for the most part  processed foods and fast foods. Unfortunately  in our agricultural system  we haven't done a good job in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world. So African agriculture  which is the place of most hunger in the world  has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen. So somehow we're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world. Who is farming them  That's what I was wondering. So I went and stood on a big grain bin in the Midwest  and that really didn't help me understand farming  but I think it's a really cool picture. And you know  the reality is that between farmers in America  who actually  quite frankly  when I spend time in the Midwest  are pretty large in general. And their farms are also large. But farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny  and that's because they're starving. Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers. And most of those people are women    which is a totally other topic that I won't get on right now  but I'd love to do the feminist thing at some point. I think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides. There's this large  consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America  and it's really been since around       after the oil crisis  when  you know  mass consolidation  mass exodus of small farmers in this country. And then in the same time period  you know  we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing. Unfortunately  what is farmed ends up as what we eat. And in America  a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last    years. It's crazy. A fifth of kids under two drinks soda. Hello. You don't put soda in bottles. But people do because it's so cheap  and so our whole food system in the last    years has really shifted. I think  you know  it's not just in our own country  but really we're exporting the system around the world  and when you look at the data of least developed countries    especially in cities  which are growing really rapidly    people are eating American processed foods. And in one generation  they're going from hunger  and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger  to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation. So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity. Not to beat a dead horse  but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese. I think that's the only way to look at it. And instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate  it's really important to look at them as one system. We get a lot of our food from all around the world  and people from all around the world are importing our food system  so it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it. The thing is  I've learned    and the technology people that are here  which I'm totally not one of them    but apparently  it really takes    years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us  like the mouse and the Internet and Windows. You know  there's    year cycles. I think      can be a really interesting year because it is the end of the    year cycle  and it's the birthday of the global food system. So that's the first birthday I want to talk about. You know  I think if we really think that this is something that's happened in the last    years  there's hope in that. It's the thirtieth anniversary of GMO crops and the Big Gulp  Chicken McNuggets  high fructose corn syrup  the farm crisis in America and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally. So there's a lot of reasons to take this    year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system. I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole    year thing. The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish both addressed this last three decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change. Well  I really care about      because it's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year. And so in my lifetime  a lot of what's happened in the world    and being a person obsessed with food    a lot of this has really changed. So my second dream is that I think we can look to the next    years as a time to change the food system again. And we know what's happened in the past  so if we start now  and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term  we might be able to recreate the food system so when I give my next talk and I'm    years old  I'll be able to say that it's been a success. So I'm announcing today the start of a new organization  or a new fund within the FEED Foundation  called the    Project. And the    Project is really focused on these long term ideas for food system change. And I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity  we might actually look for long term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone. We all tend to think that these systems are quite different  and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world  but if we take a    year view  there's more hope in collaborative ideas. So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the ONE campaign and Slow Food  which don't seem right now to have much in common  we can talk about holistic  long term  systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone. Some ideas I've had is like  look  the reality is    kids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots and so do kids in Botswana. And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods  Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish. Understanding how to produce protein in a way that's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers. And you know  these are really relevant topics that are long term and important for both people in Africa who are small farmers and people in America who are farmers and eaters. And I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way  where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips. Well  if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple  then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three quarters of the products being made just from corn  soy and wheat. The   Project.org is launched  and I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start. And it'll be growing over the next few months. But I really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at things like the food system and make change. Trees epitomize stasis. Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations  but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs  trees become very dynamic entities  moving and growing. And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists. I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas  and that produced art. The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir  and what I learned was that different species have different signatures  like a Picasso versus a Monet. But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it  so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree    which produced this painting    moved in a single year  I simply measured and summed each of those lines. I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year. You might have a guess. The answer is actually         miles  or seven times around the globe. And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs  we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities  but rather extremely dynamic. And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees  to consider other entities that are also static and stuck  but which cry for change and dynamicism  and one of those entities is our prisons. Prisons  of course  are where people who break our laws are stuck  confined behind bars. And our prison system itself is stuck. The United States has over  .  million incarcerated men and women. That number is rising. Of the     incarcerated people that are released     will return to prison. Funds for education  for training and for rehabilitation are declining  so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues. I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons  and I think the answer is yes. In the year       I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections. Working with four prisons  we began bringing science and scientists  sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons. We give science lectures  and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting. That  I think  is movement. We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state. That  I think  is movement. We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs    the Oregon spotted frog    for later release into protected wetlands. That  I think  is movement. And just recently  we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities. They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners. They're kept in bare cells like this for    hours a day. When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals  they're placed in immobile booths like this. For one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards. Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments  we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards  putting them on the walls  so at least they get contact with visual images of nature. This is Mr. Lopez  who has been in solitary confinement for    months  and he's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene  more calm  less apt to violence. And so what we see  I think  is that small  collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope. We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks. But if trees can create art  if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year  if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs  then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves  like grief  like addictions  like racism  that can also change. Thank you very much. I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people  and that was in     . I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future  but I will not use digital technology  as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead  I have progressed  and I am  today  launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA  this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world        had one billion people. In the developing world  she said  they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world  people were healthy  educated  rich  and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in       all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this  in the developing world  far away  the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world  which we still use linguistically when we talk about  the West  and  the Developing World.  But the world has changed  and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world  and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you  because since      what has happened in the world up to      is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course  there's been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy  so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries  they have moved on  you know  and they have become emerging economies  we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company  Geely  they acquired the Volvo company  and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes  they are still almost as poor as they were    years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions  the three billions here  which are also becoming emerging economies  because they are quite healthy  relatively well educated  and they already also have two to three children per woman  as those  richer also  have. And their aspiration now is  of course  to buy a bicycle  and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today  no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here  the very poorest  to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking  biking  driving  flying    there are people on all levels  and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in     . And what will happen in the future  Well  I'm going to project into     . I was in Shanghai recently  and I listened to what's happening in China  and it's pretty sure that they will catch up  just as Japan did. All the projections  say that  this one  billion  will  only  grow with one to two or three percent.  But this second  grows with seven  eight percent  and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries  the emerging income countries  they will also forge forwards economically. And if  but only if  we invest in the right green technology    so that we can avoid severe climate change  and energy can still be relatively cheap    then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion  What about the poorest two billion here  Will they move on  Well  here population  growth  comes in because there  among emerging economies  we already have two to three children per woman  family planning is widely used  and population growth is coming to an end. Here  among the poorest   population is growing. So these  poorest  two billion will  in the next decades  increase to three billion  and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing    but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen    that can stop this  growth  from happening. Because we already have this  growth  in process. But if  and only if   the poorest  get out of poverty  they get education  they get improved child survival  they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come  to live  here  then population growth will stop in     . We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas  dark blue is Africa  brown is Europe  green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That's India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman  two children  four children  six children  eight children    big families  small families. The year is     . And down here  child survival  the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school     percent     percent     percent      and almost     percent  as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look  this is the world my teacher talked about in       one billion Western world here    high child survival  small families    and all the rest  the rainbow of developing countries  with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened  I start the world. Here we go. Can you see  as the years pass by  child survival is increasing  They get soap  hygiene  education  vaccination  penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.  When  they get up to    percent child survival  then families decrease  and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there  to small families . Look  Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size  but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion  those  two  boxes I had over here  They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only    to    percent  meaning that if you have six children born  there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population  growth  to stop is to continue to improve child survival to    percent. That's why investments by Gates Foundation  UNICEF and aid organizations  together with national government in the poorest countries  are so good  because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen  Well  I'm not an optimist  neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious  possibilist.  It's a new category where we take emotion apart  and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty  and global governance  the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone  leading the world  living its own life. This will not happen  again . The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world    nothing more  nothing less. But it's a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much. This is the ocean as I used to know it. And I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times  I really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now  no matter where I am  even where I know none of the oil has gone  I sort of see slicks  and I'm finding that I'm very much haunted by it. But what I want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context  not just about the oil eruption  but what it means and why it has happened. First  just a little bit about me. I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid  and because I did  I wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved. And now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing  and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly. Now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on  that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it. It's like you dipped a marble in water. And the same thing with the atmosphere  If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball  you would get that little sphere of gas on the right. So we live on the most fragile  little soap bubble you can imagine  a very sacred soap bubble  but one that is very  very easy to affect. And all the burning of oil and coal and gas  all the fossil fuels  have changed the atmosphere greatly. Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up. We're warming the climate. So the blowout in the Gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization. Beyond warming  we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified    and already measurably so  and already affecting animals. Now in the laboratory  if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is    not  .   which is the normal pH of seawater    but  .   it dissolves in about three days. If you take a sea urchin larva from  .   put it in a pH of  .     not a huge change    it becomes deformed and dies. And already  commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places. Coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem. So this really matters. Now  let's take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit. One of the things that really impresses me about the people in the Gulf  They are really  really aquatic people. And they can handle water. They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes. When the water goes down  they know what to do. But when it's something other than water  and their water habitat changes  they don't have many options. In fact  those entire communities really don't have many options. They don't have another thing they can do. They can't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn't one in their community. If you go to the Gulf and you look around  you do see a lot of oil. You see a lot of oil on the ocean. You see a lot of oil on the shoreline. If you go to the site of the blowout  it looks pretty unbelievable. It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car  and you just dumped it in the ocean. And one of the really most incredible things  I think  is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest. Parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic. You go in along the shore  you can find it everywhere. It's really messy. If you go to the places where it's just arriving  like the eastern part of the Gulf  in Alabama  there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach. And they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach. They're not allowed to put more than    pounds of sand in a    gallon plastic bag. They have thousands and thousands of plastic bags. I don't know what they're going to do with all that stuff. Meanwhile  there are still people trying to use the beach. They don't see the little  tiny sign that says   Stay out of the water.  Their kids are in the water  they're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals. It's a mess. If you go to the place where the oil has been a while  it's an even bigger mess. And there's basically nobody there anymore  a few people trying to keep using it. You see people who are really shell shocked. They are very hardworking people. All they know about life is they get up in the morning  and if their engine starts  they go to work. They always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the Gulf. They're finding that their world is really collapsing. And so you can see  literally  signs of their shock  signs of their outrage  signs of their anger  and signs of their grief. These are the things that you can see. There's a lot you can't see  also  underwater. What's going on underwater  Well  some people say there are oil plumes. Some people say there are not oil plumes. And Congressman Markey asks  you know   Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes   But I couldn't take a submarine ride    especially between the time I knew I was coming here and today    so I had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico. So this is the Gulf of Mexico  sparkling place full of fish. I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. And I learned    in fact  I confirmed    the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix until you add a dispersant  and then they start mixing. And you add a little energy from the wind and the waves  and you get a big mess  a big mess that you can't possibly clean  you can't touch  you can't extract and  I think most importantly    this is what I think    you can't see it. I think it's being hidden on purpose. Now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess  that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream. But as many people have said  there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on. Personally  I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body  because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene. But you can see it. You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface  and then it is attacked  because they don't want the evidence  in my opinion. Okay. We heard that bacteria eat oil  So do sea turtles. When it breaks up  it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria. Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish. These guys have to swim around through it. I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here. A writer named Ted Williams called me  and he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw  because he's writing an article for Audubon magazine. He said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago    like about a week ago    and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what's going on. That guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings. He has no bookings left. Everybody wanted their deposit back. Everybody is fleeing. That's the story of thousands of people. But he told Ted that on the last day he went out  a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat  and it was splattering oil out its blowhole. And he moved away because it was his last fishing trip  and he knew that the dolphins scare fish. So he moved away from it  turned around a few minutes later  it was right next to the side of the boat again. He said that in    years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that. And he felt that    he felt that it was coming to ask for help. Sorry. Now  in the Exxon Valdez spill  about    percent of the killer whales died in the first few months. Their numbers have never recovered. So the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable. It's going to take longer for some things. And some things  I think  will probably come back a little faster. The other thing about the Gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf at certain parts of the year. So the Gulf is a really important piece of water    more important than a similar volume of water in the open Atlantic Ocean. These tuna swim the entire ocean. They get in the Gulf Stream. They go all the way to Europe. When it comes time to spawn  they come inside  and these two tuna that were tagged  you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick. They're probably having  at the very least  a catastrophic spawning season this year. I'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water. They don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway. But these are really high performance athletic animals. I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills. I don't know if it'll affect the adults. If it's not  it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae  I would certainly think. But if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down  that's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades. So while the oil spill  the leak  the eruption  is a catastrophe  I think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very  very long time. It's not like we're starting with something that's been okay. We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with. If you look around at the birds  there are a lot of birds in the Gulf that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year  but then leave. And they populate much larger areas. So for instance  most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds. They were all on the Gulf in May  while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places. Down on the lower left there are Ruddy Turnstones and Sanderlings. They breed in the high arctic  and they winter down in southern South America. But they concentrate in the Gulf and then fan out all across the arctic. I saw birds that breed in Greenland in the Gulf  so this is a hemispheric issue. The economic effects go at least nationally in many ways. The biological effects are certainly hemispheric. I think that this is one of the most absolutely mind boggling examples of total unpreparedness that I can even think of. Even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor  at least they shot back. And we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do. There was nothing ready  and  you know  as we can see by what they're doing. Mainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants. The booms are absolutely not made for open water. They don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated. They get near shore. Look at these two boats. That one on the right is called Fishing Fool. And I think  you know  that's a great name for boats that think that they're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the Gulf right now with oil at the surface. The dispersants make the oil go right under the booms. The booms are only about    inches in diameter. So it's just absolutely crazy. Here are shrimp boats employed. There are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets. Here they are working. You can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom. All they're doing is stirring it. It's just ridiculous. Also  for all the shoreline that has booms    hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline    all of the shoreline that has booms  there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms. There is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them. And that lower photo  that's a bird colony that has been boomed. Everybody's trying to protect the bird colonies there. Well  as an ornithologist  I can tell you that birds fly  and that    and that booming a bird colony doesn't do it  it doesn't do it. These birds make a living by diving into the water. In fact  really what I think they should do  if anything    they're trying so hard to protect those nests    actually  if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave  and that would be better for them this year. As far as cleaning them  I don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds. It's really  really important that we express our compassion. I think that's the most important thing that people have  is compassion. It's really important to get those images and to show it. But really  where are those birds going to get released to  It's like taking somebody out of a burning building  treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building  because the oil is still gushing. I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident. I think that this is the result of gross negligence. Not just B.P. B.P. operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could. And they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that's supposed to be our government  protecting us. It turns out that    you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the United States    you know  if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil  you would be in big trouble. And you have to really wonder who are the laws made for  and who has gotten above the laws. Now there are things that we can do in the future. We could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need. It would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making        holes in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil  oil might start coming out of one of them. And you'd have some idea of what to do. That's certainly one of the things we need to do. But I think we have to understand where this leak really started from. It really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it's our government  meant to protect the larger public interest. So I think that the oil blowout  the bank bailout  the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause. We still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people. And even though the police can be a little annoying at times    giving us tickets and stuff like that    nobody says that we should just get rid of them. But in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least    years  there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from  buying the government out from under us. Now this has been a problem for a very  very long time. You can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America  and even Thomas Jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country. Okay  people who say they're conservative  if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic  they would tell these corporations to go to hell. That's what it would really mean to be conservative. So what we really need to do is regain the idea that it's our government safeguarding our interests and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost. I think there are signs of hope. We seem to be waking up a little bit. The Glass Steagall Act    which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen  and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts    that was put in effect in       was systematically destroyed. Now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place  but the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed. So it's a continued fight. It's a historic moment right now. We're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the Gulf  or we will make the moment we need out of this  as many people have noted today. There's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this. We've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling. The first offshore wells were called whales. The first offshore drills were called harpoons. We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time. Now are we stuck with this  Ever since we lived in caves  every time we wanted any energy  we lit something on fire  and that is still what we're doing. We're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy. And people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive. Who says it's too expensive  People who sell us fossil fuels. We've been here before with energy  and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch  because the cheapest energy was slavery. Energy is always a moral issue. It's an issue that is moral right now. It's a matter of right and wrong. Thank you very much. When I was a student here in Oxford in the     s  the future of the world was bleak. The population explosion was unstoppable. Global famine was inevitable. A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives. The acid rain was falling on the forests. The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year. The oil was running out  and a nuclear winter would finish us off. None of those things happened  and astonishingly  if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime  the average per capita income of the average person on the planet  in real terms  adjusted for inflation  has tripled. Lifespan is up by    percent in my lifetime. Child mortality is down by two thirds. Per capita food production is up by a third. And all this at a time when the population has doubled. How did we achieve that  whether you think it's a good thing or not  How did we achieve that  How did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous  The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population  and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita. I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine  to meet and  indeed  to mate. In other words  you need to understand how ideas have sex. I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this. These are both real objects. One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo erectus. The other is obviously a computer mouse. They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree. I've tried to work out which is bigger  and it's almost impossible. And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand. They're both technologies. In the end  their similarity is not that interesting. It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand. The differences are what interest me  because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years    from one and a half million years ago to half a million years ago. Homo erectus made the same tool for        generations. Of course there were a few changes  but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days. There was no progress  no innovation. It's an extraordinary phenomenon  but it's true. Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years. And there's another difference too  which is the object on the left is made from one substance. The object on the right is made from a confection of different substances  from silicon and metal and plastic and so on. And more than that  it's a confection of different ideas  the idea of plastic  the idea of a laser  the idea of transistors. They've all been combined together in this technology. And it's this combination  this cumulative technology  that intrigues me  because I think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world. My body's an accumulation of ideas too  the idea of skin cells  the idea of brain cells  the idea of liver cells. They've come together. How does evolution do cumulative  combinatorial things  Well  it uses sexual reproduction. In an asexual species  if you get two different mutations in different creatures  a green one and a red one  then one has to be better than the other. One goes extinct for the other to survive. But if you have a sexual species  then it's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages. So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species. It's not confined to its own lineage. What's the process that's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution  And I think the answer is exchange  the habit of exchanging one thing for another. It's a unique human feature. No other animal does it. You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange    and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals    But the exchange of one object for another never happens. As Adam Smith said   No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog.  You can have culture without exchange. You can have  as it were  asexual culture. Chimpanzees  killer whales  these kinds of creatures  they have culture. They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring. In this case  chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks. But the difference is that these cultures never expand  never grow  never accumulate  never become combinatorial  and the reason is because there is no sex  as it were  there is no exchange of ideas. Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops. There's no exchange of ideas between them. And why does exchange raise living standards  Well  the answer came from David Ricardo in     . And here is a Stone Age version of his story  although he told it in terms of trade between countries. Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe. Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe. So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam. He doesn't need Adam. He can make his own spears and axes. Well no  because if you think about it  if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes  and then they trade  then they will each have saved an hour of work. And the more they do this  the more true it's going to be  because the more they do this  the better Adam is going to get at making axes and the better Oz is going to get at making spears. So the gains from trade are only going to grow. And this is one of the beauties of exchange  is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization  which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on. Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time. That is prosperity  the saving of time in satisfying your needs. Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by. If you had to start from scratch  let's say you go out into the countryside. You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it. You render it down. You make a candle  etc. etc. How long is it going to take you  Quite a long time. How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you're on the average wage in Britain today  And the answer is about half a second. Back in       you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light. And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since       as it were  because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else  or you can acquire another good or service. And back in       it would have been    minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage. Back in       you'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour. In other words  the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in     . Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse  and ask yourself   Who made them and for who   The stone axe was made by someone for himself. It was self sufficiency. We call that poverty these days. But the object on the right was made for me by other people. How many other people  Tens  Hundreds  Thousands  You know  I think it's probably millions. Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee  which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig  who was drilling for oil  which was going to be made into the plastic  etc. They were all working for me  to make a mouse for me. And that's the way society works. That's what we've achieved as a species. In the old days  if you were rich  you literally had people working for you. That's how you got to be rich  you employed them. Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him. They made his silly outfits  like this  and they did his silly hairstyles  or whatever. He had     people to prepare his dinner every night. But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles and looking at Louis XIV's pictures  he has     people doing his dinner tonight too. They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over Paris  and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal that's probably got higher quality than Louis XIV even had. And that's what we've done  because we're all working for each other. We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other's living standards. Now  you do get other animals working for each other too. Ants are a classic example  workers work for queens and queens work for workers. But there's a big difference  which is that it only happens within the colony. There's no working for each other across the colonies. And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor. That is to say  they specialize with respect to reproduction. The queen does it all. In our species  we don't like doing that. It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves  is reproduction. Even in England  we don't leave reproduction to the Queen. So when did this habit start  And how long has it been going on  And what does it mean  Well  I think  probably  the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor. But I've got no evidence for that. It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male. In all hunter gatherer societies today  there's a foraging division of labor between  on the whole  hunting males and gathering females. It isn't always quite that simple  but there's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females. And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides. The woman knows that  in the Hadzas' case here    digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat    she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat. And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog. And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging to get roots. All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it's big enough to share some. And so both sides raise each other's standards of living through the sexual division of labor. When did this happen  We don't know  but it's possible that Neanderthals didn't do this. They were a highly cooperative species. They were a highly intelligent species. Their brains on average  by the end  were bigger than yours and mine in this room today. They were imaginative. They buried their dead. They had language  probably  because we know they had the FOXP  gene of the same kind as us  which was discovered here in Oxford. And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills. They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals. But there's no evidence of a sexual division of labor. There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females. It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men. And the other thing there's no evidence for is exchange between groups  because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains  the tools they made  are always made from local materials. For example  in the Caucasus there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools. They're always made from local chert. In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date         years ago  and some of those are from local chert  but more    but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away. And when human beings began moving objects around like this  it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups. Trade is    times as old as farming. People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing. Exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years. And the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between    and         years ago in Africa  when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia. You also see seashells    as discovered by a team here in Oxford    moving     miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria. And that's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups. And that will have led to specialization. How do you know that long distance movement means trade rather than migration  Well  you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals  who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa  which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe. They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs  and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia. So long distance movement of tools is a sign of trade  not migration. What happens when you cut people off from exchange  from the ability to exchange and specialize  And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress  you can actually throw it into reverse. An example is Tasmania. When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island        years ago  the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland  they actually experienced regress. They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about       people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had. It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island. How many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after        years  It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego    similar island  similar people. The reason  because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight  and there was trading contact across that straight throughout        years. The Tasmanians were isolated. Go back to this image again and ask yourself  not only who made it and for who  but who knew how to make it. In the case of the stone axe  the man who made it knew how to make it. But who knows how to make a computer mouse  Nobody  literally nobody. There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse. I mean this quite seriously. The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know. He just knows how to run a company. The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic  and so on. We all know little bits  but none of us knows the whole. I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read  the economist in the     s  called  I  Pencil  in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made  and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil  because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite  and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing. And what we've done in human society  through exchange and specialization  is we've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand. It's not the same with language. With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other. But with technology  we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities. We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree. And by the way  that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested in the debate about I.Q.  about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups. It's completely irrelevant. What's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas  and how well they're cooperating  not how clever the individuals are. So we've created something called the collective brain. We're just the nodes in the network. We're the neurons in this brain. It's the interchange of ideas  the meeting and mating of ideas between them  that is causing technological progress  incrementally  bit by bit. However  bad things happen. And in the future  as we go forward  we will  of course  experience terrible things. There will be wars  there will be depressions  there will be natural disasters. Awful things will happen in this century  I'm absolutely sure. But I'm also sure that  because of the connections people are making  and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before  I'm also sure that technology will advance  and therefore living standards will advance. Because through the cloud  through crowd sourcing  through the bottom up world that we've created  where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate  we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation. Thank you. I'm an American  which means  generally  I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno's size running into each other at extremely high speeds. That said  it's been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks. I go onto Twitter  there are all these strange words that I've never heard before  FIFA  vuvuzela  weird jokes about octopi. But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out  that I haven't been able to figure out  is this phrase  Cala a boca  Galvao.  If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks  you've probably seen this. It's been a major trending topic. Being a monolingual American  I obviously don't know what the phrase means. So I went onto Twitter  and I asked some people if they could explain to me  Cala a boca  Galvao.  And fortunately  my Brazilian friends were more than ready to help. They explained that the Galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that's in terrible  terrible danger. In fact  I'll let them tell you a bit more about it. Narrator  A word about Galvao  a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil. Every year  more than         Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades. Ethan Zuckerman  Obviously  this is a tragic situation  and it actually gets worse. It turns out that  not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive  useful for headdresses  it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties  which means that there's a terrible problem with Galvao abuse. Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao. And it's terribly endangered. The good news about this is that the global community    again  my Brazilian friends tell me    is pitching in to help out. It turns out that Lady Gaga has released a new single    actually five or six new singles  as near as I can tell    titled  Cala a boca  Galvao.  And my Brazilian friends tell me that if I just tweet the phrase  Cala a boca  Galvao      cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird. Now  most of you have figured out that this was a prank  and actually a very  very good one.  Cala a boca  Galvao  actually means something very different. In Portugese  it means  Shut your mouth  Galvao.  And it specifically refers to this guy  Galvao Bueno  who's the lead soccer commentator for Rede Globo. And what I understand from my Brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine. He can ruin the most interesting match by just spouting cliche again and again and again. So Brazilians went to that first match against North Korea  put up this banner  started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to tweet the phrase   Cala a boca  Galvao.  And in fact  were so successful at this that it topped Twitter for two weeks. Now there's a couple    there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this. And the first lesson  which I think is a worthwhile one  is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online  so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase. So as long as activism is that simple  it's pretty easy to get away with. The other thing you can take from this  by the way  is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter. There's more than five million of them. As far as national representation     percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter. That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K. Next to Japan  it's the second most represented by population. Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks  and you didn't realize this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it  you're like most of us. Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with. And if you are like me  a big  geeky  white  American guy  you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky  white  American guys. And you don't necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space. It's also extremely surprising to many Americans  a heavily African American space. Twitter recently did some research. They looked at their local population. They believe that    percent of American Twitter users are African American. That's about twice as high as African Americans are represented in the population. And again  that was very shocking to many Twitter users  but it shouldn't be. And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into Trending Topics. And you tend to find topics that are almost entirely African American conversations. This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas and Martin Wattenberg  two amazing visualization designers  who looked at a weekend's worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics were basically segregated conversations    and in ways that you wouldn't expect. It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation  that cookout is a mostly black conversation. And what's crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter  it's literally a quick click away. You click on that cookout tag  there an entirely different conversation with different people participating in it. But generally speaking  most of us don't. We end up within these filter bubbles  as my friend Eli Pariser calls them  where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know. And we tend not to see that wider picture. Now for me  I'm surprised by this  because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be. If you go back into the early days of the internet  when cyber utopians like Nick Negroponte were writing big books like  Being Digital   the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences  to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another. Negroponte started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms. He's at a technology conference in Florida. And he's looking at something really  truly absurd  which is bottles of Evian water on the table. And Negroponte says this is crazy. This is the old economy. It's the economy of moving these heavy  slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do. We're heading to the future of bits  where everything is speedy  it's weightless. It can be anywhere in the world at any time. And it's going to change the world as we know it. Now  Negroponte has been right about a lot of things. He's totally wrong about this one. It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits. If I walk into a store in the United States  it's very  very easy for me to buy water that's bottled in Fiji  shipped at great expense to the United States. It's actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fijian feature film. It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music. It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news  which is strange  because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji. There's a coup government. There's a military government. There's crackdowns on the press. It's actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment. Here's what I think is going on. I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization. We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world. And that's a framework that includes things like airline routes. It includes things like the Internet cables. We look at a map like this one  and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away. You can get on a flight in London  you can end up in Bangalore later today. Two hops  you're in Suva  the capitol of Fiji. It's all right there. When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks  you get a very different picture. You start looking at how the global plane flights move  and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat. It's extremely lumpy. There are parts of the world that are very  very well connected. There's basically a giant pathway in the sky between London and New York. but look at this map  and you can watch this for  you know  two or three minutes. You won't see very many planes go from South America to Africa. And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off. When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible  and we look at what actually happens  we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does. So here's the problem that I've been interested in in the last decade or so. The world is  in fact  getting more global. It's getting more connected. More of problems are global in scale. More of our economics is global in scale. And our media is less global by the day. If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the     s     to    percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast. That's down to about    to    percent. And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world. Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk. Alisa's the president of Public Radio International. And she made a cartogram  which is basically a distorted map based on what American television news casts looked at for a month. And you see that when you distort a map based on attention  the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant bloated U.S. and a couple of other countries which we've invaded. And that's basically what our media is about. And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news    which is dreadful  and I agree that it's dreadful    I've been mapping elite media like the New York Times  and I get the same thing. When you look at the New York Times  you look at other elite media  what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we've invaded. It turns out that new media isn't necessarily helping us all that much. Here's a map made by Mark Graham who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute. A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been geo coded. And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe. Even within Wikipedias  where we're creating their own content online  there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based  rather than to the rest of the world. In the U.K.  you can get up  you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session  you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia  from Canada  God forbid from the U.S. You probably won't. If you look at online media consumption    in this case  in the top    users of the internet    more than    percent of the news readership is on domestic news sites. It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than  the U.K.   because we actually like reading your media  rather than vice versa. So all of this starts leading me to think that we're in a state that I refer to as imaginary cosmopolitanism. We look at the internet. We think we're getting this wide view of the globe. We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese  and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world. And we forget that most of the time we're checking Boston Red Sox scores. So this is a real problem    not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year    but it's a real problem because  as we're discussing here at TED  the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope  they require global conversations to get to global solutions. This is a problem we have to solve. So here's the good news. For six years  I've been hanging out with these guys. This is a group called Global Voices. This is a team of bloggers from around the world. Our mission was to fix the world's media. We started in     . You might have noticed  we haven't done all that well so far. Nor do I think we are by ourselves  actually going to solve the problem. But the more that I think about it  the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world. The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention. In this case    the map of the world at night by NASA    they're dark literally because of lack of electricity. And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you're not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs. What I'm starting to realize is that you can get media  it's just an enormous amount of work  and you need an enormous amount of encouragement. One of those dark spots is Madagascar  a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there. And so the people who founded Foko Club in Madagascar weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country. They were doing something much simpler. It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet. but what happened was that Madagascar went through a violent coup. Most independent media was shut down. And the high school students who were learning to blog through Foko Club suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstrations  the violence  everything that was going on within this country. So a very  very small program designed to get people in front of computers  publishing their own thoughts  publishing independent media  ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country. Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing most people here don't speak Malagasy. I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese    which is sort of sad if you think about it  as it's now the most represented language on the internet. Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this. If you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site  you notice this really cute box at the top  which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a translation of the page. Unfortunately  it's a machine translation of the page. And while Google is very  very good with some languages  it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese. And the results can be pretty funny. What you really want    what I really want  is eventually the ability to push a button and have this queued so a human being can translate this. And if you think this is absurd  it's not. There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan. And Yeeyan is a group of         volunteers who get online every day. They look for the most interesting content in the English language. They translate roughly     articles a day from major newspapers  major websites. They put it online for free. It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei  who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots and who couldn't believe how biased American media coverage was. And he said   If there's one thing I can do  I can start translating  so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better.  And my question to you is  if Yeeyan can line up         people to translate the English internet into Chinese  where's the English language Yeeyan  Who's going after Chinese  which now has     million internet users out there  My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say. So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese  there's no guarantee that we're going to find it. When we look for information online  we basically have two strategies. We use a lot of search. And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for. But if what you're looking for is serendipity  if you want to stumble onto something that you didn't know you needed  our main philosophy is to look to our social networks  to look for our friends. What are they looking at  Maybe we should be looking at it. The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock. You end up flocking with a lot of people who are probably similar to you  who have similar interests. And it's very  very hard to get information from the other flocks  from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests. To do this  at a certain point  you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock. You need a guide. So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices. She has one of the hardest jobs in the world. Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors from killing each other  she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East. And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit  and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who's given up smoking for the month of Ramadan  she has to know something about a global audience. She has to know something about what stories are available. Basically  she's a deejay. She's a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her  who's able to listen to the audience  and who's able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another. I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process. I think what's great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for deejays to reach a wider audience. I know Amira. I can ask her what to read. But with the internet  she's in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read. And you can listen to her as well  if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened. So once you start widening like this  once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots  once you start translating  once you start curating  you end up in some really weird places. This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog  which is AfriGadget. And AfriGadget is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context. And specifically  it's looking at a blacksmith in Kibera in Nairobi  who is turning the shaft of a Landrover into a cold chisel. And when you look at this image  you might find yourself going   Why would I conceivably care about this   And the truth is  this guy can probably explain this to you. This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference. He goes by the moniker White African. He's both a very well known American geek  but he's also Kenyan  he was born in Sudan  grew up in Kenya. He is a bridge figure. He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds    one in the world of the African technology community  one in the world of the American technology community. And so he's able to tell a story about this blacksmith in Kibera and turn it into a story about repurposing technology  about innovating from constraint  about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials. He knows one world  and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world  both of which he has deep connections to. These bridge figures  I'm pretty well convinced  are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web. But the trick with bridges is  ultimately  you need someone to cross them. And that's where we start talking about xenophiles. So if I found myself in the NFL  I suspect I would spend my off season nursing my wounds  enjoying my house  so on and so forth    possibly recording a hip hop album. Dhani Jones  who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals  has a slightly different approach to the off season. Dhani has a television show. It's called  Dhani Tackles the Globe.  And every week on this television show  Dhani travels to a different nation of the world. He finds a local sporting team. He trains with them for a week  and he plays a match with them. And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing. It's because  for him  sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world. For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food. For a lot of us it might be literature or writing. But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it. The goal of my Talk here is not to persuade the people in this room to embrace your xenophilia. My guess    given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal    is that most of you are xenophiles  whether or not you use that term. My challenge instead is this. It's not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world. We have to figure out how to rewire the systems that we have. We have to fix our media. We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education. We have to fix our immigration policy. We need to look at ways of creating serendipity  of making translation pervasive  and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures. And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles. That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help. I'm a storyteller. That's what I do in life    telling stories  writing novels    and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni. But before I go there  please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story. I will do so with the help of words  of course  but also a geometrical shape  the circle  so throughout my talk  you will come across several circles. I was born in Strasbourg  France to Turkish parents. Shortly after  my parents got separated  and I came to Turkey with my mom. From then on  I was raised as a single child by a single mother. Now in the early     s  in Ankara  that was a bit unusual. Our neighborhood was full of large families  where fathers were the heads of households  so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment. In fact  I grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood. On the one hand was my mother  a well educated  secular  modern  westernized  Turkish woman. On the other hand was my grandmother  who also took care of me and was more spiritual  less educated and definitely less rational. This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye. Many people visited my grandmother  people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands. Each time  my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic  take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove. Then one by one  she would encircle these thorns with dark ink. A week later  the patient would come back for a follow up examination. Now  I'm aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists  but the truth is  of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions  I did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed. I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying  In response she said   Yes  praying is effective  but also beware of the power of circles.  From her  I learned  amongst many other things  one very precious lesson    that if you want to destroy something in this life  be it an acne  a blemish or the human soul  all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls. It will dry up inside. Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle. We all do. We're born into a certain family  nation  class. But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted  then we too run the risk of drying up inside. Our imagination might shrink  our hearts might dwindle  and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons. Our friends  neighbors  colleagues  family    if all the people in our inner circle resemble us  it means we are surrounded with our mirror image. Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out. It's an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection. Ironically   living in  communities of the like minded is one of the greatest dangers of today's globalized world. And it's happening everywhere  among liberals and conservatives  agnostics and believers  the rich and the poor  East and West alike. We tend to form clusters based on similarity  and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people. In my opinion  one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling. Stories cannot demolish frontiers  but they can punch holes in our mental walls. And through those holes  we can get a glimpse of the other  and sometimes even like what we see. I started writing fiction at the age of eight. My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal. In retrospect  I think she was slightly worried about my sanity. I was constantly telling stories at home  which was good  except I told this to imaginary friends around me  which was not so good. I was an introverted child  to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when I bumped into them  so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day to day experiences and emotions. What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring  and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself. Instead  I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened. And thus began my life long passion for writing fiction. So from the very beginning  fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives  other possibilities. And please bear with me  I'll draw a circle and come back to this point. Now one other thing happened around this same time. My mother became a diplomat. So from this small  superstitious  middle class neighborhood of my grandmother  I was zoomed into this posh  international school  in Madrid   where I was the only Turk. It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the  representative foreigner.  In our classroom  there were children from all nationalities  yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan  egalitarian classroom democracy. Instead  it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen    not as an individual on his own  but as the representative of something larger. We were like a miniature United Nations  which was fun  except whenever something negative  with regards to a nation or a religion  took place. The child who represented it was mocked  ridiculed and bullied endlessly. And I should know  because during the time I attended that school  a military takeover happened in my country  a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope  and Turkey got zero points in  the  Eurovision Song Contest. I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days. I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there. The other children asked me about the movie  Midnight Express   which I had not seen  they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked  because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers  and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair. I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country  politics  cigarettes and the veil. After Spain  we went to Jordan  Germany and Ankara again. Everywhere I went  I felt like my imagination was the only suitcase I could take with me. Stories gave me a sense of center  continuity and coherence  the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked. In my mid twenties  I moved to Istanbul  the city I adore. I lived in a very vibrant  diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels. I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit in     . When I ran out of the building at three in the morning  I saw something that stopped me in my tracks. There was the local grocer there    a grumpy  old man who didn't sell alcohol and didn't speak to marginals. He was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks. I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her  and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today    a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk. In the face of death and destruction  our mundane differences evaporated  and we all became one even if for a few hours. But I've always believed that stories  too  have a similar effect on us. I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake  but when we are reading a good novel  we leave our small  cozy apartments behind  go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against. Shortly after  I went to a women's college in Boston  then Michigan. I experienced this  not so much as a geographical shift  as a linguistic one. I started writing fiction in English. I'm not an immigrant  refugee or exile    they ask me why I do this    but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself. I love writing in Turkish  which to me is very poetic and very emotional  and I love writing in English  which to me is very mathematical and cerebral. So I feel connected to each language in a different way. For me  like millions of other people around the world today  English is an acquired language. When you're a latecomer to a language  what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration. As latecomers  we always want to say more  you know  crack better jokes  say better things  but we end up saying less because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue. And that gap is very intimidating. But if we manage not to be frightened by it  it's also stimulating. And this is what I discovered in Boston    that frustration was very stimulating. At this stage  my grandmother  who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety  started to include in her daily prayers that I urgently get married so that I could settle down once and for all. And because God loves her  I did get married. But instead of settling down  I went to Arizona. And since my husband is in Istanbul  I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul    the two places on the surface of earth that couldn't be more different. I guess one part of me has always been a nomad  physically and spiritually. Stories accompany me  keeping my pieces and memories together  like an existential glue. Yet as much as I love stories  recently  I've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story. And this is a subject that I would love to think about together. When my first novel written in English came out in America  I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.  I liked your book   he said   but I wish you had written it differently.  I asked him what he meant by that. He said   Well  look at it. There's so many Spanish  American  Hispanic characters in it  but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man.  Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston  so to me  it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Turkish characters  but I understood what my critic was looking for. And I also understood that I would keep disappointing him. He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity. He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one. We often talk about how stories change the world  but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated  read and reviewed. Many authors feel this pressure  but non Western authors feel it more heavily. If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world  like me  then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and  preferably  the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women. You're expected to write informative  poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant garde to your Western colleagues. What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid is happening in the literary world today. Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own  but as the representatives of their respective cultures  a few authors from China  a few from Turkey  a few from Nigeria. We're all thought to have something very distinctive  if not peculiar. The writer and commuter James Baldwin gave an interview in      in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality. When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer  Baldwin stopped and said   But don't you see  There's nothing in me that is not in everybody else  and nothing in everybody else that is not in me.  When identity politics tries to put labels on us  it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger. There's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the Western world are lumped together. I never forget my first multicultural reading  in Harvard Square about    years ago. We were three writers  one from the Philippines  one Turkish and one Indonesian    like a joke  you know. And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste. It was only because of our passports. Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories  not so much the imaginary. A function is attributed to fiction. In this way  not only the writers themselves  but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger. But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West. It comes from everywhere. And I experienced this firsthand when I was put on trial in      for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel. I had intended to write a constructive  multi layered novel about an Armenian and a Turkish family through the eyes of women. My micro story became a macro issue when I was prosecuted. Some people criticized  others praised me for writing about the Turkish Armenian conflict. But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction. It was just a story. And when I say   just a story   I'm not trying to belittle my work. I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is  not as a means to an end. Writers are entitled to their political opinions  and there are good political novels out there  but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics. Chekhov said   The solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things. And only the latter is an artist's responsibility.  Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects. One is interested in sweeping generalizations. The other  in nuances. One draws boundaries. The other recognizes no frontiers. Identity politics is made of solid bricks. Fiction is flowing water. In the Ottoman times  there were itinerant storytellers called  meddah.  They would go to coffee houses  where they would tell a story in front of an audience  often improvising. With each new person in the story  the meddah would change his voice  impersonating that character. Everybody could go and listen  you know    ordinary people  even the sultan  Muslims and non Muslims. Stories cut across all boundaries  like  The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja   which were very popular throughout the Middle East  North Africa  the Balkans and Asia. Today  stories continue to transcend borders. When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk  they usually don't listen to each other  but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author  and vice versa  connecting and empathizing with the narrator. Literature has to take us beyond. If it cannot take us there  it is not good literature. Books have saved the introverted  timid child that I was    that I once was. But I'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them. When the poet and mystic  Rumi  met his spiritual companion  Shams of Tabriz  one of the first things the latter did was to toss Rumi's books into water and watch the letters dissolve. The Sufis say   Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance.  The problem with today's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge    we know a lot about each other  or so we think    but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves  it makes us elitist  distant and disconnected. There's a metaphor which I love  living like a drawing compass. As you know  one leg of the compass is static  rooted in a place. Meanwhile  the other leg draws a wide circle  constantly moving. Like that  my fiction as well. One part of it is rooted in Istanbul  with strong Turkish roots  but the other part travels the world  connecting to different cultures. In that sense  I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal  both from here and everywhere. Now those of you who have been to Istanbul have probably seen Topkapi Palace  which was the residence of Ottoman sultans for more than     years. In the palace  just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines  there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn. It's between buildings. I'm intrigued by this concept. We usually distrust those areas that fall in between things. We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn  who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness. But my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most. When I write fiction I cherish elusiveness and changeability. I like not knowing what will happen    pages later. I like it when my characters surprise me. I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel  and perhaps it will be a very happy story  and in my next book  I might write about a handsome  gay professor in Norway. As long as it comes from our hearts  we can write about anything and everything. Audre Lorde once said   The white fathers taught us to say  'I think  therefore I am.'  She suggested   I feel  therefore I am free.  I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift. And yet  why is it that  in creative writing courses today  the very first thing we teach students is  write what you know   Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all. Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about. We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel. We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next. In the end  stories move like whirling dervishes  drawing circles beyond circles. They connect all humanity  regardless of identity politics  and that is the good news. And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem   Come  let us be friends for once  let us make life easy on us  let us be lovers and loved ones  the earth shall be left to no one.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Julian  welcome. It's been reported that WikiLeaks  your baby  has  in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world's media combined. Can that possibly be true  Julian Assange  Yeah  can it possibly be true  It's a worry    isn't it     that the rest of the world's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined. CA  How does it work  How do people release the documents  And how do you secure their privacy  JA  So these are    as far as we can tell    classical whistleblowers  and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us. So we use this state of the art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet  to hide trails  pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections. We get information in the mail  the regular postal mail  encrypted or not  vet it like a regular news organization  format it    which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do  when you're talking about giant databases of information    release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks. CA  So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate  but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is  JA  That's right  yeah. Very rarely do we ever know  and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible. CA  I think that's the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership. So let's take  an  example  actually. This is something you leaked a few years ago. If we can have this document up ... So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago. Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened  JA  So this is the Kroll Report. This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in     . Prior to       Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about    years. He was a soft dictator of Kenya. And when Kibaki got into power    through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya    they commissioned this report  spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report. And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi  who was the richest man    still is the richest man    in Kenya. It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism. So I went there in       and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election    the national election  December   . When we released that report  we did so three days after the new president  Kibaki  had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out  Daniel arap Moi  so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck. CA  And    I mean  to cut a long story short    word of the report leaked into Kenya  not from the official media  but indirectly  and in your opinion  it actually shifted the election. JA  Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya  in Tanzanian and South African press. And so it came in from the outside. And that  after a couple of days  made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it. And it ran for    nights straight on Kenyan TV  shifted the vote by    percent  according to a Kenyan intelligence report  which changed the result of the election. CA  Wow  so your leak really substantially changed the world  JA  Yep. CA  Here's    We're going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video. The video itself is longer  but here's a short clip. This is    this is intense material  I should warn you. Radio  ... just fuckin'  once you get on 'em just open 'em up. I see your element  uh  got about four Humvees  uh  out along ... You're clear. All right. Firing. Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot. Light 'em all up. C'mon  fire  Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n. Hotel ... Bushmaster Two Six  Bushmaster Two Six  we need to move  time now  All right  we just engaged all eight individuals. Yeah  we see two birds  helicopters   and we're still firing. Roger. I got 'em. Two Six  this is Two Six  we're mobile. Oops  I'm sorry. What was going on  God damn it  Kyle. All right  hahaha. I hit 'em. CA  So  what was the impact of that  JA  The impact on the people who worked on it was severe. We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story. So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene. CA  So  I mean     people died in that attack  right  including two Reuters employees  JA  Yeah. Two Reuters employees  two young children were wounded. There were between    and    people killed all together. CA  And releasing this caused widespread outrage. What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage  do you think  JA  I don't know. I guess people can see the gross disparity in force. You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street  and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing    millimeter cannon shells on everyone    looking for any excuse to do so    and killing people rescuing the wounded. And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents because that's their full time job. CA  I mean  there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst  Bradley Manning  arrested  and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you  along with         classified U.S. embassy cables. I mean  did he  JA  We have denied receiving those cables. He has been charged  about five days ago  with obtaining         cables and releasing   . Now  we had released  early in the year  a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy  but this is not necessarily connected. I mean  I was a known visitor of that embassy. CA  I mean  if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ... JA  We would have released them.  CA  You would   JA  Yeah.  CA  Because   JA  Well  because these sort of things reveal what the true state of  say  Arab governments are like  the true human rights abuses in those governments. If you look at declassified cables  that's the sort of material that's there. CA  So let's talk a little more broadly about this. I mean  in general  what's your philosophy  Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information  JA  Well  there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world  what sort of information can achieve reform. And there's a lot of information. So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing  that's a really good signal that when the information gets out  there's a hope of it doing some good    because the organizations that know it best  that know it from the inside out  are spending work to conceal it. And that's what we've found in practice  and that's what the history of journalism is. CA  But are there risks with that  either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large  where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence  JA  Not that we have seen with anything we have released. I mean  we have a harm immunization policy. We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal    personally identifying information in it. But there are legitimate secrets    you know  your records with your doctor  that's a legitimate secret    but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well motivated. CA  So they are well motivated. And what would you say to  for example  the  you know  the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military  and he says   You know what  you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out. It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying. That gives the impression  has given the impression  to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people. Actually  they're not. My son isn't. How dare you   What would you say to that  JA  Yeah  we do get a lot of that. But remember  the people in Baghdad  the people in Iraq  the people in Afghanistan    they don't need to see the video  they see it every day. So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception. That's what they see every day. It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all  and that's our hope. CA  So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government. Light is good. But do you see any irony in the fact that  in order for you to shine that light  you have to  yourself  create secrecy around your sources  JA  Not really. I mean  we don't have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet. We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources. Should they come forward  that would be a tricky situation for us  but we're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission  not to screw it up. CA  I'd actually be interested  just based on what we've heard so far    I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience. You know  there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian. You know  hero    people's hero    bringing this important light. Dangerous troublemaker. Who's got the hero view  Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view  JA  Oh  come on. There must be some. CA  It's a soft crowd  Julian  a soft crowd. We have to try better. Let's show them another example. Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked  but I think for TED you are. I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened  right  What is this  JA  So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day. So late last year    in November last year    there was a series of well blowouts in Albania  like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico  but not quite as big. And we got a report    a sort of engineering analysis into what happened    saying that  in fact  security guards from some rival  various competing oil firms had  in fact  parked trucks there and blown them up. And part of the Albanian government was in this  etc.  etc. And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it  so it was an extremely difficult document for us. We couldn't verify it because we didn't know who wrote it and knew what it was about. So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up. So under that basis  we put it out and said   Look  we're skeptical about this thing. We don't know  but what can we do  The material looks good  it feels right  but we just can't verify it.  And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it  wanting to track down the source    saying   Hey  we want to track down the source.  And we were like   Oh  tell us more. What document is it  precisely  you're talking about  Can you show that you had legal authority over that document  Is it really yours   So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID. Yeah. That's happened quite a lot though. This is like one of our methods of identifying  of verifying  what a material is  is to try and get these guys to write letters. CA  Yeah. Have you had information from inside BP  JA  Yeah  we have a lot  but I mean  at the moment  we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort. So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we're re engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have. That's a problem. I mean  like any sort of growing startup organization  we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth  and that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information. CA  So that's the key bottleneck  basically journalistic volunteers and or the funding of journalistic salaries  JA  Yep. Yeah  and trusted people. I mean  we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with  so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff  and then lower security cases. CA  So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this. And I think I read that as a kid you went to    different schools. Can that be right  JA  Well  my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult  so the combination between the two ... CA  I mean  a psychologist might say that's a recipe for breeding paranoia. JA  What  the movie business  CA  And you were also    I mean  you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on. JA  Well  I was a journalist. You know  I was a very young journalist activist at an early age. I wrote a magazine  was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager. So you have to be careful with hacker. I mean there's like    there's a method that can be deployed for various things. Unfortunately  at the moment  it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts. So this phrase is not  not as nice as it used to be. CA  Yeah  well  I certainly don't think you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account  but what about your core values  Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them  JA  I'm not sure about the incident. But the core values  well  capable  generous men do not create victims  they nurture victims. And that's something from my father and something from other capable  generous men that have been in my life. CA  Capable  generous men do not create victims  they nurture victims  JA  Yeah. And you know  I'm a combative person  so I'm not actually so big on the nurture  but some way    there is another way of nurturing victims  which is to police perpetrators of crime. And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time. CA  So just tell us  very quickly in the last minute  the story  what happened in Iceland  You basically published something there  ran into trouble with a bank  then the news service there was injuncted from running the story. Instead  they publicized your side. That made you very high profile in Iceland. What happened next  JA  Yeah  this is a great case  you know. Iceland went through this financial crisis. It was the hardest hit of any country in the world. Its banking sector was    times the GDP of the rest of the economy. Anyway  so we release this report in July last year. And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air  like out of a movie  injunction landed on the news desk  and the news reader was like   This has never happened before. What do we do   Well  we just show the website instead  for all that time  as a filler  and we became very famous in Iceland  went to Iceland and spoke about this issue. And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again  and as a result  working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts  we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press  with the strongest journalistic protections in the world  with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech. Iceland's a Nordic country  so  like Norway  it's able to tap into the system. And just a month ago  this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously. CA  Wow. Last question  Julian. When you think of the future then  do you think it's more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control  more secrecy  or us watching Big Brother  or it's just all to be played for either way  JA  I'm not sure which way it's going to go. I mean  there's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world    within the E.U.  between China and the United States. Which way is it going to go  It's hard to see. That's why it's a very interesting time to be in    because with just a little bit of effort  we can shift it one way or the other. CA  Well  it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion to say  Julian  be careful  and all power to you. JA  Thank you  Chris.  CA  Thank you.  In October       the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The   . Icons like Batman  Superman  Wonder Woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons Jabbar  Noora  Jami and their colleagues. It's a story of intercultural intersections  and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies  As fascism took over Europe in the     s  an unlikely reaction came out of North America. As Christian iconography got changed  and swastikas were created out of crucifixes  Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men in the United States and Canada  also going back to the Bible. Consider this  like the prophets  all the superheroes are missing parents. Superman's parents die on Krypton before the age of one. Bruce Wayne  who becomes Batman  loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City. Spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle. And all of them  just like the prophets who get their message from God through Gabriel  get their message from above. Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan when the spider descends from above and gives him his message through a bite. Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom when a big bat flies over his head  and he sees it as an omen to become Batman. Superman is not only sent to Earth from the heavens  or Krypton  but he's sent in a pod  much like Moses was on the Nile. And you hear the voice of his father  Jor El  saying to Earth   I have sent to you my only son.  These are clearly biblical archetypes  and the thinking behind that was to create positive  globally resonating storylines that could be tied to the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message. And it's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked. This is the kind of thinking that went into creating The   . The    references the    attributes of Allah in the Koran  things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about. It doesn't matter what your religion is  even if you're an atheist  you don't raise your kid telling him  you know   Make sure you lie three times a day.  Those are basic human values. And so the backstory of The    takes place in       which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it. All the books from Bait al Hikma library  the most famous library in its day  were thrown in the Tigris River  and the Tigris changes color with ink. It's a story passed on generation after generation. I rewrote that story  and in my version  the librarians find out that this is going to happen    and here's a side note  if you want a comic book to do well  make the librarians the hero. It always works well. So the librarians find out and they get together a special solution  a chemical solution called King's Water  that when mixed with    stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books. But the Mongols get there first. The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River. Some librarians escape  and over the course of days and weeks  they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization. Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of    stones each through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain  where they're safe for     years. But in       two important things happen. The first is the fall of Granada  the last Muslim enclave in Europe. The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India  but he gets lost. So    of the stones are smuggled onto the Nina  the Pinta and the Santa Maria and are spread in the New World. Thirty three go on the Silk Road to China  South Asia and Southeast Asia. And    are spread between Europe  the Middle East and Africa. And now it's       and there are    heroes from    different countries. Now it's very easy to assume that those books  because they were from a library called Bait al Hikma  were Muslim books  but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library  his name was al Ma'mun    he was Harun al Rashid's son. He had told his advisers   Get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic  and I will pay them its weight in gold.  After a while  his advisers complained. They said   Your Highness  the scholars are cheating. They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold.  To which he said   Let them be  because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them.  So the idea of an open architecture  an open knowledge  is not new to my neck of the desert. The concept centers on something called the Noor stones. Noor is Arabic for light. So these    stones  a few kind of rules in the game  Number one  you don't choose the stone  the stone chooses you. There's a King Arthur element to the storyline  okay. Number two  all of The     when they first get their stone  or their power  abuse it  they use it for self interest. And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone  you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers  okay. Number three  the    stones all have within them a mechanism that self updates. Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world. Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place. Some believe that means that the original interpretation from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today. I don't belong there. Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living  breathing document  and I captured that idea within these stones that self update. Now the main bad guy  Rughal  does not want these stones to update  so he's trying to get them to stop updating. He can't use the stones  but he can stop them. And by stopping them  he has more of a fascist agenda  where he gets some of The    to work for him    they're all wearing cookie cutter  same color uniforms They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are. And he controls them from the top down    whereas when they work for the other side  eventually  when they find out this is the wrong person  they've been manipulated  they actually  each one has a different  colorful kind of dress. And the last point about the    Noor stones is this. So The    work in teams of three. Why three  A couple of reasons. Number one  we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together  because the third person is temptation or the devil  right  I think that's there in all cultures  right  But this is not about religion  it's not about proselytizing. There's this very strong social message that needs to get to kind of the deepest crevices of intolerance  and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game. And so this is the way I dealt with it. They work in teams of three  two boys and a girl  two girls and a boy  three boys  three girls  no problem. And the Swiss psychoanalyst  Carl Jung  also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures  so I figure I'm covered. Well ... I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East  so you     Laughter  you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story. So here's some of the characters that we have. Mujiba  from Malaysia  her main power is she's able to answer any question. She's the Trivial Pursuit queen  if you want  but when she first gets her power  she starts going on game shows and making money. We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power. Now  Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer. So the    attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang  there's the powerful  the hegemonous  the strong  and there's also the kind  the generous. I'm like  are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong  I'm like  you know what  I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime  so ... We have Jami from Hungary  who first starts making weapons  He's the technology wiz. Musawwira from Ghana  Hadya from Pakistan  Jaleel from Iran who uses fire. And this is one of my favorites  Al Batina from Yemen. Al Batina is the hidden. So Al Batina is hidden  but she's a superhero. I came home to my wife and I said   I created a character after you.  My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots. And she said   Show me.  So I showed this. She said   That's not me.  I said   Look at the eyes. They're your eyes.  So I promised my investors this would not be another made in fifth world country production. This was going to be Superman  or it wasn't worth my time or their money. So from day one  the people involved in the project  bottom left is Fabian Nicieza  writer for X Men and Power Rangers. Next to him is Dan Panosian  one of the character creators for the modern day X Men. Top right is Stuart Moore  a writer for Iron Man. Next to him is John McCrea  who was an inker for Spiderman. And we entered Western consciousness with a tagline   Next Ramadan  the world will have new heroes   back in     . Now I went to Dubai  to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference  and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist. Didn't have a product  but had energy. And I found somebody from The New York Times  and I cornered him  and I pitched him. And I think I scared him     Laughter  because he basically promised me    we had no product    but he said   We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you'll just go away.  So I said   Great.  So I called him up a few weeks afterward. I said   Hi  Hesa.  And he said   Hi.  I said   Happy New Year.  He said   Thank you. We had a baby.  I said   Congratulations.  Like I care  right   So when's the article coming out   He said   Naif  Islam and cartoon  That's not timely. You know  maybe next week  next month  next year  but  you know  it'll come out.  So a few days after that  what happens  What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy. I became timely. So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times. Next thing you knew  there's a full page covering us positively  January   nd        which changed our lives forever  because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic  guess what they got  they got me. And The    were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world. And that led to all kinds of things  from being in curricula in universities and schools to    one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia  it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab    it looked like a school. The good news is they're all holding copies of The     smiling  and they found me to sign the picture. The bad news is they were all photocopies  so we didn't make a dime in revenue. We've been able to license The    comic books into eight languages so far    Chinese  Indonesian  Hindi  Urdu  Turkish. Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago called The    Village Theme Park            square feet     rides  all with our characters  a couple back to school licenses in Spain and Turkey. But the biggest thing we've done to date  which is just amazing  is that we've done a    episode animated series  which is done for global audiences  in fact  we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey  we know. It's  D CGI  which is going to be very high quality  written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben    and Spiderman and Star Wars  Clone Wars. In this clip I'm about to show you  which has never been seen in the public before  there is a struggle. Two of the characters  Jabbar  the one with the muscles  and Noora  the one that can use light  are actually wearing the cookie cutter fascist gray uniform because they're being manipulated. They don't know  OK  and they're trying to get another member of The    to join them. So there's a struggle within the team. So if we can get the lights ...   The      Jabbar  Dana  I can't see where to grab hold. I need more light. What's happening  Dana  There's too much darkness. Rughal  There must be something we can do. Man  I won't send any more commandos in until I know it's safe. Dr. Razem  It's time to go  Miklos. Miklos  Must download file contents. I can't forget auntie. Jabbar  Dana  I can't do this without you. Dana  But I can't help. Jabbar  You can  even if you don't believe in yourself right now. I believe in you. You are Noora the Light. Dana  No. I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything. Jabbar  Then what about the rest of us  Don't we deserve to be saved  Don't I  Now  tell me which way to go. Dana  That way. Alarm  Threat imminent. Jabbar  Aaaahhh  Miklos  Stay away from me. Jabbar  We're here to help you. Dr. Razem  Don't listen to them. Dana  Miklos  that man is not your friend. Miklos  No. He gave me access  and you want to reboot the  unclear . No more  unclear .   The      Thank you. So  The     is technology  it's entertainment  it's design. But that's only half the story. As the father of five sons  I worry about who they're going to be using as role models. I worry because all around me  even within my extended family  I see religion being manipulated. As a psychologist  I worry for the world in general  but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world. Now  I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State. I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program  and I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership  only to end up being tortured by their heroes. And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is  but when it's done by your hero  that just breaks you in so many ways. I left Bellevue  went to business school and started this. Now  one of the things that I refer to when I    about the importance of this message    is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University  where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior  and I gave the students two articles  one from The New York Times and one from New York magazine. And I took away the name of the writer  the name of the  unclear     everything was gone except the facts. And the first one was about a group called The Party of God  who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal. Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately  okay. The second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn't related to her. And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place. The first one  they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate. The second one  they were actually split between Saudi and Afghanistan. What blew their mind was the first one took place in India  it was the party of a Hindu God. The second one took place in upstate New York. It was an Orthodox Jewish community. But what breaks my heart and what's alarming is that in those two interviews  the people around  who were interviewed as well  refer to that behavior as Talibanization. In other words  good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way. This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism. But what do the students in Kuwait say  They said it's us    and this is dangerous. It's dangerous when a group self identifies itself as extreme. This is one of my sons  Rayan  who's a Scooby Doo addict. You can tell by the glasses there. He actually called me a meddling kid the other day. But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him. Last summer when we were in our home in New York  he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working  and he came in   Baba  I want you to come with me. I want my toy.   Yes  Rayan  just go away.  He left his Scooby Doo in his house. I said   Go away. I'm working. I'm busy.  And what Rayan did then is he sat there  he tapped his foot on the floor  at three and a half  and he looked at me and he said   Baba  I want you to come with me to my office in my house. I have work to do.  Rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level. And with The     that is what we aim to do. You know  I think that there's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas. And when I see pictures like this  of parents or uncles who think it's cute to have a little child holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something  the hope is by linking enough positive things to the Koran  that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they're proud there  to that. And I think    I think The    can and will achieve its mission. As an undergrad at Tufts University  we were giving away free falafel one day and  you know  it was Middle East Day or something. And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel  ate it and  you know  talked and left. And no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was  behind us   free falafel.  You know. Or so we thought  until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor  pointed up to the sign and said   Who's falafel   True story. She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting. Just today  D.C. Comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover. On that cover you see Batman  Superman and a fully clothed Wonder Woman with our Saudi member of The     our Emirati member and our Libyan member. On April           President Barack Obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech    in which he reached out to the Muslim world    the most innovative was that The    reach back out to the Justice League of America. We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols  like the falafel  can be misunderstood because of baggage  and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others. In a world like that  they'll always be a job for Superman and The   . Thank you very much. Well  indeed  I'm very  very lucky. My talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months    seemingly unrelated  but as you will see  actually all having to do with the story I want to tell you today. The first one was actually a funeral    to be more precise  a reburial. On May   nd  there was a hero's reburial in Frombork  Poland of the   th century astronomer who actually changed the world. He did that  literally  by replacing the Earth with the Sun in the center of the Solar System  and then with this simple looking act  he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution  which many call the Copernican Revolution. Now that was  ironically  and very befittingly  the way we found his grave. As it was the custom of the time  Copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave  together with    others in that cathedral. DNA analysis  one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last     years that he started  was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was Copernicus' hair    obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on. That match was unambiguous. The DNA matched  and we know that this was indeed Nicolaus Copernicus. Now  the connection between biology and DNA and life is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus because  even back then  his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask  if the Earth is just a planet  then what about planets around other stars  What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds  about life on other planets  In fact  I'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time. And at the time  people actually answered that question positively   Yes.  But there was no evidence. And here begins     years of frustration  of unfulfilled dreams    the dreams of Galileo  Giordano Bruno  many others    which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time.  What is life  What is the origin of life  Are we alone   And that especially happened in the last    years  at the end of the   th century  when the beautiful developments due to molecular biology  understanding the code of life  DNA  all of that seemed to actually put us  not closer  but further apart from answering those basic questions. Now  the good news. A lot has happened in the last few years  and let's start with the planets. Let's start with the old Copernican question  Are there earths around other stars  And as we already heard  there is a way in which we are trying  and now able  to answer that question. It's a new telescope. Our team  befittingly I think  named it after one of those dreamers of the Copernican time  Johannes Kepler  and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out  find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy  and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth happen to be out there. The telescope is actually built similarly to the  well known to you  Hubble Space Telescope  except it does have an additional lens    a wide field lens  as you would call it as a photographer. And if  in the next couple of months  you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this  you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets day and night  without any interruption  for the next four years. The way we do that  actually  is with a method  which we call the transit method. It's actually mini eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star. Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that  but if you have a million stars  you'll find enough planets. And as you see on this animation  what Kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star. We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this. All the stars for Kepler are just points of light. But we learn a lot from that  not only that there is a planet there  but we also learn its size. How much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is. We learn about its orbit  the period of its orbit and so on. So  what have we learned  Well  let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that I'm here to tell you today. What Kepler does is discover a lot of candidates  which we then follow up and find as planets  confirm as planets. It basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size. There are small planets  there are bigger planets  there are big planets  okay. So we count many  many such planets  and they have different sizes. We do that in our solar system. In fact  even back during the ancients  the Solar System in that sense would look on a diagram like this. There will be the smaller planets  and there will be the big planets  even back to the time of Epicurus and then of course Copernicus and his followers. Up until recently  that was the Solar System    four Earth like planets with small radius  smaller than about two times the size of the Earth    and that was of course Mercury  Venus  Mars  and of course the Earth  and then the two big  giant planets. Then the Copernican Revolution brought in telescopes  and of course three more planets were discovered. Now the total planet number in our solar system was nine. The small planets dominated  and there was a certain harmony to that  which actually Copernicus was very happy to note  and Kepler was one of the big proponents of. So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets. But up until  literally     years ago  that was all we knew about planets. And that's what the frustration was. The Copernican dream was unfulfilled. Finally     years ago  the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star  and we actually did pretty well. In the next    years  almost     planets were discovered orbiting other stars  with different methods. Unfortunately  as you can see  there was a very different picture. There was of course an explanation for it  We only see the big planets  so that's why most of those planets are really in the category of  like Jupiter.  But you see  we haven't gone very far. We were still back where Copernicus was. We didn't have any evidence whether planets like the Earth are out there. And we do care about planets like the Earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate  to emerge  to survive. And we didn't have the evidence for that. So today  I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope  Kepler  has been able to tell us in the last few weeks  and  lo and behold  we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus. You can see here  the small planets dominate the picture. The planets which are marked  like Earth    are  definitely more than any other planets that we see. And now for the first time  we can say that. There is a lot more work we need to do with this. Most of these are candidates. In the next few years we will confirm them. But the statistical result is loud and clear. And the statistical result is that planets like our own Earth are out there. Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets. So the question is  what do we do next  Well  first of all  we can study them now that we know where they are. And we can find those that we would call habitable  meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on Earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen. So  we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own Milky Way Galaxy harbors. And the number  as you might expect  is pretty staggering. It's about     million such planets. That's great news. Why  Because with our own little telescope  just in the next two years  we'll be able to identify at least    of them. So that's great because then we can go and study them    remotely  of course    with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years. We can find what they're made of  would their atmospheres have water  carbon dioxide  methane. We know and expect that we'll see that. That's great  but that is not the whole news. That's not why I'm here. Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part. The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next. And here comes biology    biology  with its basic question  which still stands unanswered  which is essentially   If there is life on other planets  do we expect it to be like life on Earth   And let me immediately tell you here  when I say life  I don't mean  dolce vita   good life  human life. I really mean life on Earth  past and present  from microbes to us humans  in its rich molecular diversity  the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions    and we call that  collectively  biochemistry  life as a chemical process  as a chemical phenomenon. So the question is  is that chemical phenomenon universal  or is it something which depends on the planet  Is it like gravity  which is the same everywhere in the universe  or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them  We need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that. And that's a very basic question  which we don't know the answer to  but which we can try    and we are trying    to answer in the lab. We don't need to go to space to answer that question. And so  that's what we are trying to do. And that's what many people now are trying to do. And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well. So this is one example that I want to show you here. When we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life  we think of compartmentalization  keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane  isolated from the rest of the environment  but yet  in an environment in which they actually could originate together. And in one of our labs  Jack Szostak's labs  it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed that the environments    which are very common on planets  on certain types of planets like the Earth  where you have some liquid water and some clays    you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles. But those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living thing on Earth looks like  like this. And they really help molecules  like nucleic acids  like RNA and DNA  stay inside  develop  change  divide and do some of the processes that we call life. Now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon. And in a sense  you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge  building a bridge from two sides of the river. On one hand  on the left bank of the river  are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments. We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities  and there is not too much lab  and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments. So that's what we are building from the left side of the river. From the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you  where we actually tried that  and it feeds back and forth  and we hope to meet in the middle one day. So why should you care about that  Why am I trying to sell you a half built bridge  Am I that charming  Well  there are many reasons  and you heard some of them in the short talk today. This understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives. But there is something more profound here  something deeper. And that deeper  underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it. And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way    not in a dissimilar way as     years ago  Copernicus' act did  by changing the way we view space and time. Now it's about something else  but it's equally profound. And half the time  what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind  to the Earth in a bigger space. And the more we learn  the more that was reinforced. You've all learned that in school    how small the Earth is compared to the immense universe. And the bigger the telescope  the bigger that universe becomes. And look at this image of the tiny  blue dot. This pixel is the Earth. It is the Earth as we know it. It is seen from  in this case  from outside the orbit of Saturn. But it's really tiny. We know that. Let's think of life as that entire planet because  in a sense  it is. The biosphere is the size of the Earth. Life on Earth is the size of the Earth. And let's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms. What if that Copernican insignificance was actually all wrong  Would that make us more responsible for what is happening today  Let's actually try that. So in space  the Earth is very small. Can you imagine how small it is  Let me try it. Okay  let's say this is the size of the observable universe  with all the galaxies  with all the stars  okay  from here to here. Do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be  It will be the size of a single  small atom. It is unimaginably small. We can't imagine it. I mean look  you can see the necktie  but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little  small atom. But that's not the whole story  you see. The universe and life are both in space and time. If that was the age of the universe  then this is the age of life on Earth. Think about those oldest living things on Earth  but in a cosmic proportion. This is not insignificant. This is very significant. So life might be insignificant in size  but it is not insignificant in time. Life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent  parent and offspring. So what does this tell us  This tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got to learn from the Copernican principle  it's all wrong. There is immense  powerful potential in life in this universe    especially now that we know that places like the Earth are common. And that potential  that powerful potential  is also our potential  of you and me. And if we are to be stewards of our planet Earth and its biosphere  we'd better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it. And the good news is we can actually  indeed do it. And let's do it. Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one  with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future. And let's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle. Thank you very much. Up until now  our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms. Whether it's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch  or even as complex as programming robotics  we have always had to give a command to a machine  or even a series of commands  in order for it to do something for us. Communication between people  on the other hand  is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed. We observe facial expressions  body language  and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another. This actually forms a large part of our decision making process. Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do  but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences. And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain  our center for control and experience. Well  it sounds like a pretty good idea  but this task  as Bruno mentioned  isn't an easy one for two main reasons  First  the detection algorithms. Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons  around         km of combined axon length. When these neurons interact  the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse  which can be measured. The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain  and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity  the brain surface is highly folded. Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses. Each individual's cortex is folded differently  very much like a fingerprint. So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain  by the time the structure has been folded  its physical location is very different between individuals  even identical twins. There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals. Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex  so that we can map the signals closer to its source  and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population. The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves. EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors  like the one that you can see here in the photo. A technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion. Now this is quite time consuming and isn't the most comfortable process. And on top of that  these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars. So with that  I'd like to invite onstage Evan Grant  who is one of last year's speakers  who's kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we've been able to develop. So the device that you see is a    channel  high fidelity EEG acquisition system. It doesn't require any scalp preparation  no conductive gel or paste. It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle. It's also wireless  so it gives you the freedom to move around. And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system  this headset only costs a few hundred dollars. Now on to the detection algorithms. So facial expressions    as I mentioned before in emotional experiences    are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization. But with the limited time we have available  I'd like to show you the cognitive suite  which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind. Now  Evan is new to this system  so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him. He's obviously not Joanne    so we'll  add user.  Evan. Okay. So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal. With neutral  there's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do. He just hangs out. He's relaxed. And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain  because every brain is different. It takes eight seconds to do this  and now that that's done  we can choose a movement based action. So Evan  choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind. Evan Grant  Let's do  pull.  Tan Le  Okay  so let's choose  pull.  So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen  and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that. The first time  nothing will happen  because the system has no idea how he thinks about  pull.  But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds. So  one  two  three  go. Okay. So once we accept this  the cube is live. So let's see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling. Ah  good job  That's really amazing. So we have a little bit of time available  so I'm going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task. And this one is difficult because it's all about being able to visualize something that doesn't exist in our physical world. This is  disappear.  So what you want to do    at least with movement based actions  we do that all the time  so you can visualize it. But with  disappear   there's really no analogies    so Evan  what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out  okay. Same sort of drill. So  one  two  three  go. Okay. Let's try that. Oh  my goodness. He's just too good. Let's try that again. EG  Losing concentration. TL  But we can see that it actually works  even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time. As I said  it's a very difficult process to imagine this. And the great thing about it is that we've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about  disappear.  As there is a machine learning algorithm in this    Thank you. Good job. Good job. Thank you  Evan  you're a wonderful  wonderful example of the technology. So  as you can see  before  there is a leveling system built into this software so that as Evan  or any user  becomes more familiar with the system  they can continue to add more and more detections  so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts. And once you've trained up the detections  these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform  application or device. So I'd like to show you a few examples  because there are many possible applications for this new interface. In games and virtual worlds  for example  your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character. Obviously  you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind. And also  colors  lighting  sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you're having  in real time. And moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world  with robots and simple machines  for example    in this case  flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking  lift  with your mind. The technology can also be applied to real world applications    in this example  a smart home. You know  from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains. And of course  also to the lighting    turning them on or off. And finally  to real life changing applications  such as being able to control an electric wheelchair. In this example  facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands. Man  Now blink right to go right. Now blink left to turn back left. Now smile to go straight. TL  We really    Thank you. We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today  and with the community's input  and also with the involvement of developers and researchers from around the world  we hope that you can help us to shape where the technology goes from here. Thank you so much. So let me just start with my story. So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college. Then I went on to tear my ACL  the ligament in my knee  and then developed an arthritic knee. And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story  and  by the way  I married a woman who has exactly the same story. So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me. So with that  let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain. Narrator  We are all aware of the risk of cancer  but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us  arthritis. Cancer may kill you  but when you look at the numbers  arthritis ruins more lives. Assuming you live a long life  there's a    percent chance you'll develop arthritis. And it's not just aging that causes arthritis. Common injuries can lead to decades of pain  until our joints quite literally grind to a halt. Desperate for a solution  we've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn out body parts  but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body  shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better  more natural way  Let's consider an alternative path. What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature  or within our own stem cells  This is the field of biologic replacements  where we replace worn out parts with new  natural ones. Kevin Stone  And so  the mission is  how do I treat these things biologically  And let's talk about both what I did for my wife  and what I've done for hundreds of other patients. First thing for my wife  and the most common thing I hear from my patients  particularly in the     to    year old age group     year old age group  is they come in and say   Hey  Doc  isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee  I'm not ready for joint replacement.  And so for her  I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that  knee  joint space. And  the allograft  replaces  the missing meniscus . And then for that unstable ligament  we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee. And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface  we did a stem cell paste graft  which we designed in       to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there. So here's my wife's bad knee on the left  and her just hiking now four months later in Aspen  and doing well. And it works  not just for my wife  but certainly for other patients. The girl on the video  Jen Hudak  just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee  as you see in the other image    and having a paste graft to that knee. And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically. So with all this success  why isn't that good enough  you might ask. Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles. There's not enough young  healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us. And the tissue's very expensive. And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue. But the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful  it's cheap  you can get it from young  healthy tissues  but the barrier is immunology. And the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl  or gal epitope. So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people  we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope. So my story in working with animal tissues starts in     . And I started first with cow Achilles tendon  where we would take the cow Achilles tendon  which is type I collagen  strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template. We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee. We've now done that procedure  and it's been done worldwide in over       cases  so it's an FDA approved and worldwide accepted way to regrow the meniscus. And that's great when I can degrade the tissue. But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament  I can't grind it up in a blender. So in that case  I have to design    and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek    an enzyme wash to wash away  or strip  those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme. And we call that a  gal stripping  technique. What we do is humanize the tissue. It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it  Laughter   and then we can put it back into a patient's knee. And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament    young  healthy  big tissue  put it into    patients in an FDA approved trial    and then one of our patients went on to have three Canadian Masters Downhill championships    on his  pig lig   as he calls it. So we know it can work. And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending. So what about the next step  What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement  not just the parts  How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement  Well here's how we're going to do it. So what we're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young  healthy pig  strip it of its antigens  load it with your stem cells  then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee  tack it on there  have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee. So that's our biologic approach right now. We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts. We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface. But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom. There's a benefit of     million years of ambulation. We can harness those benefits. We can use thicker  younger  better tissues than you might have injured in your knee  or that you might have when you're        or   . We can do it as an outpatient procedure. We can strip that tissue very economically  and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global. And so welcome to super biologics. It's not hardware. It's not software. It's bioware. It's version  .  of you. And so with that  coming to a    coming to an operating theater near you soon  I believe. Thank you very much. Today  I'm going to take you around the world in    minutes. My base of operations is in the U.S.  but let's start at the other end of the map  in Kyoto  Japan  where I was living with a Japanese family while I was doing part of my dissertational research    years ago. I knew even then that I would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings  but they popped up when I least expected it. On my first day  I went to a restaurant  and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar. After a pause  the waiter said   One does not put sugar in green tea.   I know   I said.  I'm aware of this custom. But I really like my tea sweet.  In response  he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation.  One does not put sugar in green tea.   I understand   I said   that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea  but I'd like to put some sugar in my green tea.  Surprised by my insistence  the waiter took up the issue with the manager. Pretty soon  a lengthy discussion ensued  and finally the manager came over to me and said   I am very sorry. We do not have sugar.  Well  since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it  I ordered a cup of coffee  which the waiter brought over promptly. Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar. My failure to procure myself a cup of sweet  green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding. This was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice. From my American perspective  when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences  she has every right to have that request met. The American way  to quote Burger King  is to  have it your way   because  as Starbucks says   happiness is in your choices.  But from the Japanese perspective  it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better    in this case  the ignorant gaijin    from making the wrong choice. Let's face it  the way I wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards  and they were doing their best to help me save face. Americans tend to believe that they've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice. They think that choice  as seen through the American lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans. Unfortunately  these beliefs are based on assumptions that don't always hold true in many countries  in many cultures. At times they don't even hold true at America's own borders. I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them. As I do so  I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds. First assumption  if a choice affects you  then you should be the one to make it. This is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for. It is essential for success. In America  the primary locus of choice is the individual. People must choose for themselves  sometimes sticking to their guns  regardless of what other people want or recommend. It's called  being true to yourself.  But do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice  Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question. In one study  which we ran in Japantown  San Francisco  we brought seven  to nine year old Anglo  and Asian American children into the laboratory  and we divided them up into three groups. The first group came in  and they were greeted by Miss Smith  who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles. The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do  and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with. When the second group of children came in  they were brought to the same room  shown the same anagrams  but this time Miss Smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with. Now when the third group came in  they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers. In reality  the kids who were told what to do  whether by Miss Smith or their mothers  were actually given the very same activity  which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen. With this procedure  we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity  making it easier for us to compare performance. Such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed. Anglo Americans  they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them  as compared to when it was chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers. It didn't matter who did the choosing  if the task was dictated by another  their performance suffered. In fact  some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted. One girl named Mary said   You asked my mother   In contrast  Asian American children performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice  second best when they chose for themselves  and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith. A girl named Natsumi even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked   Could you please tell my mommy I did it just like she said   The first generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice. For them  choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality  but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected. If they had a concept of being true to one's self  then that self  most likely   was  composed  not of an individual  but of a collective. Success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences. Or  you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others. The assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others. When  in contrast  two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected  then they may amplify one another's success by turning choosing into a collective act. To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships. Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands. It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility. It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self defining act. People that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating  but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone. The second assumption which informs the American view of choice goes something like this. The more choices you have  the more likely you are to make the best choice. So bring it on  Walmart  with         different products  and Amazon  with    million books and Match.com with    what is it        million date possibilities now. You will surely find the perfect match. Let's test this assumption by heading over to Eastern Europe. Here  I interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries  who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society. One of the most interesting revelations came not from an answer to a question  but from a simple gesture of hospitality. When the participants arrived for their interview  I offered them a set of drinks  Coke  Diet Coke  Sprite    seven  to be exact. During the very first session  which was run in Russia  one of the participants made a comment that really caught me off guard.  Oh  but it doesn't matter. It's all just soda. That's just one choice.  I was so struck by this comment that from then on  I started to offer all the participants those seven sodas  and I asked them   How many choices are these   Again and again  they perceived these seven different sodas  not as seven choices  but as one choice  soda or no soda. When I put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas  now they perceived it as only three choices    juice  water and soda. Compare this to the die hard devotion of many Americans  not just to a particular flavor of soda  but to a particular brand. You know  research shows repeatedly that we can't actually tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. Of course  you and I know that Coke is the better choice. For modern Americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world  choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is. Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better  and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters. But for Eastern Europeans  the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge. They were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim. When asked   What words and images do you associate with choice   Grzegorz from Warsaw said   Ah  for me it is fear. There are some dilemmas you see. I am used to no choice.  Bohdan from Kiev said  in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace   It is too much. We do not need everything that is there.  A sociologist from the Warsaw Survey Agency explained   The older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them. They were never given a chance to learn how to react.  And Tomasz  a young Polish man said   I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum. I don't mean to say that I want no choice  but many of these choices are quite artificial.  In reality  many choices are between things that are not that much different. The value of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options. Americans train their whole lives to play  spot the difference.  They practice this from such an early age that they've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability. In fact  though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice  we don't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent. When someone can't see how one choice is unlike another  or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast  the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating. Instead of making better choices  we become overwhelmed by choice  sometimes even afraid of it. Choice no longer offers opportunities  but imposes constraints. It's not a marker of liberation  but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae. In other words  choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in America when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it. But it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever increasing choice. Americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice. We all have physical  mental and emotional  Laughter  limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter  even in the grocery store  let alone over the course of our entire lives. A number of my studies have shown that when you give people    or more options when they're making a choice  they make poorer decisions  whether it be health care  investment  other critical areas. Yet still  many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them. This brings me to the third  and perhaps most problematic  assumption   You must never say no to choice.  To examine this  let's go back to the U.S. and then hop across the pond to France. Right outside Chicago  a young couple  Susan and Daniel Mitchell  were about to have their first baby. They'd already picked out a name for her  Barbara  after her grandmother. One night  when Susan was seven months pregnant  she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room. The baby was delivered through a C section  but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia  a loss of oxygen to the brain. Unable to breathe on her own  she was put on a ventilator. Two days later  the doctors gave the Mitchells a choice  They could either remove Barbara off the life support  in which case she would die within a matter of hours  or they could keep her on life support  in which case she might still die within a matter of days. If she survived  she would remain in a permanent vegetative state  never able to walk  talk or interact with others. What do they do  What do any parent do  In a study I conducted with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali  American and French parents were interviewed. They had all suffered the same tragedy. In all cases  the life support was removed  and the infants had died. But there was a big difference. In France  the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed  while in the United States  the final decision rested with the parents. We wondered  does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one  We found that it did. Even up to a year later  American parents were more likely to express negative emotions  as compared to their French counterparts. French parents were more likely to say things like   Noah was here for so little time  but he taught us so much. He gave us a new perspective on life.  American parents were more likely to say things like   What if  What if   Another parent complained   I feel as if they purposefully tortured me. How did they get me to do that   And another parent said   I feel as if I've played a role in an execution.  But when the American parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision  they all said   No.  They could not imagine turning that choice over to another  even though having made that choice made them feel trapped  guilty  angry. In a number of cases they were even clinically depressed. These parents could not contemplate giving up the choice  because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice. In her essay   The White Album   Joan Didion writes   We tell ourselves stories in order to live. We interpret what we see  select the most workable of the multiple choices. We live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images  by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria  which is our actual experience.  The story Americans tell  the story upon which the American dream depends  is the story of limitless choice. This narrative promises so much  freedom  happiness  success. It lays the world at your feet and says   You can have anything  everything.  It's a great story  and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it. But when you take a close look  you start to see the holes  and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways. Americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice  believing that they will be  or ought to be  welcomed with open hearts and minds. But the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn't always work out that way. The phantasmagoria  the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative  varies from place to place. No single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere. Moreover  Americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative  which has been driving their choices for so long. Robert Frost once said that   It is poetry that is lost in translation.  This suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving  whatever gives us a new way to see  cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language. But Joseph Brodsky said that   It is poetry that is gained in translation   suggesting that translation can be a creative  transformative act. When it comes to choice  we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives. Instead of replacing one story with another  we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written. No matter where we're from and what your narrative is  we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do  and what it can represent. And this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism. Rather  it teaches us when and how to act. It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice  to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn't always deliver. If we learn to speak to one another  albeit through translation  then we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness  complexity and compelling beauty. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Sheena  there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book. But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind. And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is  How does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on  Sheena Iyengar  Well  it's funny that you should ask that because one of the things that's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices. And as you just mentioned  there's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days. Yeah  I    as you would expect    get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because I have to rely on what other people suggest. And I can't decide. And so one time I was in a beauty salon  and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink. And one was called  Ballet Slippers.  And the other one was called  Adorable.  And so I asked these two ladies  and the one lady told me   Well  you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'   Well  what does it look like    Well  it's a very elegant shade of pink.   Okay  great.  The other lady tells me to wear  Adorable.   What does it look like    It's a glamorous shade of pink.  And so I asked them   Well  how do I tell them apart  What's different about them   And they said   Well  one is elegant  the other one's glamorous.  Okay  we got that. And the only thing they had consensus on  well  if I could see them  I would clearly be able to tell them apart. And what I wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color  so I decided to do a little experiment. So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory  and I stripped the labels off. And I brought women into the laboratory  and I asked them   Which one would you pick      percent of the women accused me of playing a trick  of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles. At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on. Now  of the women that could tell them apart  when the labels were off  they picked  Adorable   and when the labels were on  they picked  Ballet Slippers.  So as far as I can tell  a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe even smells different. BG  Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena. For a moment  what I need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination. We're in   th century Japan on the west coast  and a little  wizened monk is hurrying along  near midnight  to the crest of a small hill. He arrives on the small hill  dripping with water. He stands there  and he looks across at the island  Sado. And he scans across the ocean  and he looks at the sky. Then he says to himself  very quietly    Turbulent the sea    Stretching across to Sado   The Milky Way .  Basho was a brilliant man. He said more with less than any human that I have ever read or talked to. Basho  in    syllables  juxtaposed a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now past  and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars  probably hundreds and hundreds of    who knows how many    planets  maybe even an ocean that we will probably call Sylvia in time. As he was nearing his death  his disciples and followers kept asking him   What's the secret  How can you make haiku poems so beautiful so easily   And toward the end  he said   If you would know the pine tree  go to the pine tree.  That was it. Sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans. If we would know the oceans  we must go to the oceans. And what I'd like to talk to you today about  a little bit  is really transforming the relationship  or the interplay  between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet. I hope it will be. There are a few key points. One of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth. Another is that there are bold  new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet. And the last is that these bold  new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet  our oceans  and eventually how we manage probably the entire planet  for what it's worth. So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system. They define what the system is. The system isn't Chesapeake Bay. It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific. It's the whole planet  the entire planet  continents and oceans together. That's the system. And basically  our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes  two sources of energy  one of which is solar  that drives the winds  the waves  the clouds  the storms and photosynthesis. The second one is internal energy. And these two war against one another almost continuously. Mountain ranges  plate tectonics  moves the continents around  forms ore deposits. Volcanoes erupt. That's the planet that we live on. It's immensely complex. Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here  but what I want you to see is this is about    percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously  and have for the last   billion years. This is a system that's been around a very long time. And these have all co evolved. What do I mean by that  They interact with one another constantly. All of them interact with one another. So the complexity of this system that we're looking at  the one driven by the sun    upper portion  mostly    and the lower portion is partly driven by the input from heat below and by other processes. This is very  very important because this is the system  this is the crucible  out of which life on the planet came  and it's now time for us to understand it. We must understand it. That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about  understand this ocean of ours  this basic life support system  the dominant life support system on the planet. Look at this complexity here. This is only one variable. If you can see the complexity  you can see how tiny  little eddies and large eddies and the motion    this is just sea surface temperature  but it's immensely complicated. Now a layer in  the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting  partly as a function of temperature  partly as a function of all the other factors  and you've got a really complicated system. That's our challenge  is to understand  understand this system in new and phenomenal ways. And there's an urgency to this. Part of the urgency comes from the fact that  of order  a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving. And part of the issue is for Cody    who's here     years old    and I have permission to relay this number. When he     years from now  is the age of Nancy Brown  there are going to be another two and a half billion people on the planet. We can't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans  but if we don't understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more thoroughly than we do now  then the stresses that we will face  and that Cody will face  and even Nancy  who's going to live till she's     will have really problems coping. All right  let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans. Look at this diagram  which is showing warm waters in red  cool waters in blue  and on the continents  what you're seeing in bright green  is the growth of vegetation  and in olive green  the dieback of vegetation. And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away from      to      and then cycling again. What you'll see is that the rhythms of growth  of vegetation    a subset of which is food on the continents    is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface temperatures. The oceans control  or at least significantly influence  correlate with  the growth patterns and the drought patterns and the rain patterns on the continents. So people in Kansas  in a wheat field in Kansas  need to understand that the oceans are central to them as well. Another complexity  this is the age of the oceans. I'm going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates. The age of the ocean  the tectonic plates  gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference. And I share with you some very high definition video that we collected in real time. Seconds after this video was taken  people in Beijing  people in Sydney  people in Amsterdam  people in Washington D.C. were watching this. Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents  but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor  there is vast reservoir of microbial activity  which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study. Some people have estimated that the biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet. It's an astonishing insight  and we have only found out about this recently. This is very  very exciting. It may be the next rainforest  in terms of pharmaceuticals. We know little or nothing about it. Well  Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying that   The real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory  but possibly in having new sets of eyes   new ways of seeing things  a new mindset. And many of you remember the early stages of oceanography  when we had to use what we had at our fingertips. And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days. Some of you remember this  I'm sure. And now  we have an entire suite of tools that are really pretty powerful    ships  satellites  moorings. But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need. And the program that I wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here  was funded  and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image. Modeling  on the right hand side  there's a very complex computational model. On the left hand side  there's a new type of mooring  which I'll show you in just a second. And on the basis of several points  the oceans are complex  and they're central to the life on earth. They are changing rapidly  but not predictably. And the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them. The computational power is amazing. But without data  those models will never ever be predicted. And that's what we really need. For a variety of reasons they're dangerous  but we feel that OOI  this Ocean Observatory Initiative  which the National Science Foundation has begun to fund  has the potential to really transform things. And the goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across and within the ocean basins  utilizing widely accessible  interactive telepresence. It's a new world. We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean  at will  communicating in real time. And this is what the system involves  a number of sites in the southern hemisphere  shown in those circles. And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites. I won't talk a lot about most of them right here  but the one on the west coast  that's in the box  is called the regional scale nodes. It was once called Neptune. And let me show you what's behind it. Fiber  next generation way of communicating. You can see the copper tips on these things. You can transmit power  but the bandwidth is in those tiny  little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter. And this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five terabits per second. This is phenomenal bandwidth. And this is what the planet looks like. We are already laced up as if we're in a fiber optic corset  if you like. This is what it looks like. And the cables go really continent to continent. It's a very powerful system  and most of our communications consist of it. So this is the system that I'm talking about  off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate  the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. And it's going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume    in the overlying ocean  on the sea floor and below the sea floor. Bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating. This is what one of those primary nodes looks like  and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle. And the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table. They will bring it and link it in. It'll be  in a sense  like having time on a telescope  except you'll have your own port. Climate change  ocean acidification  dissolved oxygen  carbon cycle  coastal upwelling  fishing dynamics    the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume. So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place. And this is just the first of these. In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues  we've set this up. Now I want to take you into the caldera. On the left hand side there is a large volcano called Axial Seamount. And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount using animation. Here's what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point. Very powerful. That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down  but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it. Or they can transfer control to someone in India or China who can take over for a while  because it's all going to be directly connected through the Internet. There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore  all available to anyone who has any interest in using it. This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location  then move to a new location. We're flying across the caldera floor. There is a number of robotic systems. There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will  if those are your experiments. The kinds of systems that will be down there  the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor  consist of    if you can read them there    there's cameras  there's pressure sensors  fluorometers  there's seismometers. It's a full spectrum of tools. Now  that mound right there actually looks like this. This is what it actually looks like. And this is the kind of activity that we can see with high definition video  because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to    stereo HD systems running continuously and  again  directed through robotic techniques from land. Very  very powerful. And these are the things that we're funded to do today. So what can we actually do tomorrow  We're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity. There are emerging technologies throughout the field around oceanography  which we will incorporate into oceanography  and through that convergence  we will transform oceanography into something even more magical. Robotics systems are just incredible these days  absolutely incredible. And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts into the ocean. Nanotechnology  this is a small generator. It's smaller than a postage stamp  and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move. Just as you move  it generates power. There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean  continuously. Imaging  Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I  but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in HD will be routine within five years. And this is the magic one. As a result of the human genome process  we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean    like an erupting volcano  or something of that sort    can actually be sampled. We pump the fluid through one of these systems  and we press the button  and it's analyzed for the genomic character. And that's transmitted back to land immediately. So in the volume of the ocean  we will know  not just the physics and the chemistry  but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis. Grid computing  the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here. We will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything  like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data. The power generation will come from the ocean itself. And the next generation fiber will be simply magic. It's far beyond what we currently have. So the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented. So within five to seven years  I see us having a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean and have all of that connected to the Internet  so we can reach many  many folks. Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation. Here's an example. When earthquakes take place  massive amounts of these new microbes we've never seen before come out of the sea floor. We have a way of addressing that  a new way of addressing that. We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here that the top of that volcano is erupting  so we deploy the troops. What are the troops  The troops are the autonomous vehicles  of course. And they fly into the erupting volcano. They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption  which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before. They eject it to the surface where it floats  and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane  and it's brought back to the laboratory within    hours of the eruption. This is doable. All the pieces are there. A laboratory  many of you heard what happened on    . Some doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a woman in France. We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning  and it would be on live TV  if we have interesting things to show. So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world  throughout the ocean. This    I've shown you sea floor    but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth. It's going to be amazing. And as I go here  I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms  and indeed  what we can bring into your pocket. Many of you don't think of this yet  but the ocean will be in your pocket. It won't be long. It won't be long. So let me leave you then with a few words from another poet  if you'll forgive me. In       T.S. Eliot wrote the  Four Quartets.  He won the Nobel Prize for literature in     . In  Little Gidding  he says    speaking I think for the human race  but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia     We shall not cease from exploration  and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time  arrive through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning. At the source of the longest river the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for  but heard  half heard in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea.  Thank you. I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species. The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious  and that's that our species  Homo sapiens  is actually really  really smart    like  ridiculously smart    like you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now. And this is  of course  not the first time you've probably recognized this. Of course  in addition to being smart  we're also an extremely vain species. So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart. You know  so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral. But of course  there's a second observation about the human species that I want to focus on a little bit more  and that's the fact that even though we're actually really smart  sometimes uniquely smart  we can also be incredibly  incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making. Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there. Don't worry  I'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes. But of course  just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude. And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face. We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create    these markets that were supposed to be foolproof    we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes. But both of these two embarrassing examples  I think  don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make  which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog worthy decisions. But it turns out  what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us  when put in certain contexts  will actually make very specific mistakes. The errors we make are actually predictable. We make them again and again. And they're actually immune to lots of evidence. When we get negative feedback  we still  the next time we're face with a certain context  tend to make the same errors. And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature. What I'm most curious about is  how is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time  You know  we're the smartest thing out there  why can't we figure this out  In some sense  where do our mistakes really come from  And having thought about this a little bit  I see a couple different possibilities. One possibility is  in some sense  it's not really our fault. Because we're a smart species  we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super  super complicated  sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand  even though we've actually created them. We create financial markets that are super complex. We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with. And of course  if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it  in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up. If this was the case  we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error. We'd actually just say  okay  let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with  the kinds of environments that are bad    get rid of those  design things better  and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be. But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying  which is  maybe it's not our environments that are messed up. Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly. This is a hint that I've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors. And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way  over and over again. It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways. This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about  because  if it's us that's messed up  it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it. We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it. So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at. How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two  What we need is a population that's basically smart  can make lots of decisions  but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have  any of the things that might mess us up    no human technology  human culture  maybe even not human language. And so this is why we turned to these guys here. These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey. These guys are New World primates  which means they broke off from the human branch about    million years ago. This means that your great  great  great great  great  great    with about five million  greats  in there    grandmother was probably the same great  great  great  great grandmother with five million  greats  in there as Holly up here. You know  so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant  but albeit evolutionary  relative. The good news about Holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do. You know  she's a smart  very cut creature  a primate as well  but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up. So she's the perfect test case. What if we put Holly into the same context as humans  Does she make the same mistakes as us  Does she not learn from them  And so on. And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do. My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago. We said  all right  let's  you know  throw so problems at Holly  see if she messes these things up. First problem is just  well  where should we start  Because  you know  it's great for us  but bad for humans. We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts. You know  where are we actually going to start with this  And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse  around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news  we said  hhmm  maybe we should actually start in the financial domain. Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do. Of course  that's when we hit a sort second problem    a little bit more methodological    which is that  maybe you guys don't know  but monkeys don't actually use money. I know  you haven't met them. But this is why  you know  they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM    you know  they don't do this stuff. So now we faced  you know  a little bit of a problem here. How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it  So we said  well  maybe we should just  actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money. So that's just what we did. What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non human currency. We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies  so we just called it a token. But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans  to actually buy different pieces of food. It doesn't look like much    in fact  it isn't like much. Like most of our money  it's just a piece of metal. As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know  once you get home  it's actually pretty useless. It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it. When we first gave it to them in their enclosures  they actually kind of picked them up  looked at them. They were these kind of weird things. But very quickly  the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food. And so you see one of our monkeys  Mayday  up here doing this. This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things    doesn't know. There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter  and Mayday quickly figures out  apparently the human wants this. Hands it over  and then gets some food. It turns out not just Mayday  all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman. So here's just a quick video of what this looks like. Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food. Here's Felix  I think. He's our alpha male  he's a kind of big guy. But he too waits patiently  gets his food and goes on. So the monkeys get really good at this. They're surprisingly good at this with very little training. We just allowed them to pick this up on their own. The question is  is this anything like human money  Is this a market at all  or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something  looking smart  but not really being smart. And so we said  well  what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency  if they were really using it like money  Well  you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other. You might have them start paying attention to price  paying attention to how much they buy    sort of keeping track of their monkey token  as it were. Do the monkeys do anything like this  And so our monkey marketplace was born. The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure. When they get a hankering for some treats  we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market. Upon entering the market    it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because  as the monkeys entered the door of the market  a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here    two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from. The salesmen were students from my lab. They dressed differently  they were different people. And over time  they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn  you know  who sold what at what price    you know  who was reliable  who wasn't  and so on. And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little  yellow food dish. and that's what the monkey can for a single token. So everything costs one token  but as you can see  sometimes tokens buy more than others  sometimes more grapes than others. So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like. Here's a monkey eye view. Monkeys are shorter  so it's a little short. But here's Honey. She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently. All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice  one grapes or two grapes. You can see Honey  very good market economist  goes with the guy who gives more. She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two. So not just Honey  most of the monkeys went with guys who had more. Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food. When we introduced sales  we saw the monkeys paid attention to that. They really cared about their monkey token dollar. The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools  they basically matched  not just qualitatively  but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market. So much so that  if you saw the monkeys' numbers  you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market. And what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that  at least for the monkeys and us  works like a real financial currency. Question is  do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do  Well  we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might. One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving    you know  just like our own species. The monkeys entered the market  spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else. The other thing we also spontaneously saw  embarrassingly enough  is spontaneous evidence of larceny. The monkeys would rip off the tokens at every available opportunity    from each other  often from us    you know  things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing  but things we spontaneously saw. So we said  this looks bad. Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do  One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out  you know  see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years. We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit. So we said  let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges  or certain kinds of economic experiments. And so  since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself  I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action. So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars    so    crisp hundred dollar bills. Take these  put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it. Because it's yours now  you can buy whatever you want. Donate it  take it  and so on. Sounds great  but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money. And here's your choice  you can either be risky  in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens. If it comes up heads  you're going to get a thousand dollars more. If it comes up tails  you get nothing. So it's a chance to get more  but it's pretty risky. Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure. I'm just going to give you     bucks. You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately. So see what your intuition is here. Most people actually go with the play it safe option. Most people say  why should I be risky when I can get       dollars for sure  This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that. You might say  eh  that's not really irrational. People are a little risk averse. So what  Well  the  so what   comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently. So now imagine that I give each and every one of you       dollars       crisp hundred dollar bills. Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before. Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet. And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time  it's a little bit worse. Now  you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money  but you're going to get the same choice. You can either take a risky loss    so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads  you're going to actually lose a lot. If it comes up tails  you lose nothing  you're fine  get to keep the whole thing    or you could play it safe  which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those      bills  for certain. And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there. So maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this  which is when presented with these options  people don't choose to play it safe. They actually tend to go a little risky. The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice. It's a       shot of a thousand or        or just       dollars with certainty. But people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with. So what's going on  Well  it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level. One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms. You really have to do work to figure out  well  one option's a thousand         one is      . Instead  we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another. So we think of things as   Oh  I'm going to get more   or  Oh  I'm going to get less.  This is all well and good  except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not. And this leads to the second bias  which economists have called loss aversion. The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red. We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money. And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this. What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss. That means when we're in a risk mindset    excuse me  when we're in a loss mindset  we actually become more risky  which can actually be really worrying. These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans. They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer    because they're evaluating them in relative terms. They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house    because they don't want to sell at a loss. The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases. If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market  would they do the same thing as people  And so this is what we did  we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe    they did the same thing every time    or guys who were risky    they did things differently half the time. And then we gave them options that were bonuses    like you guys did in the first scenario    so they actually have a chance more  or pieces where they were experiencing losses    they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got. And so this is what this looks like. We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen. The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape  so it looks pretty good. But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses. The guy on the left is a safe bonus. All the time  he adds one  to give the monkeys two. The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus. Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus    so this is a bonus of zero. Sometimes the monkeys get two extra. For a big bonus  now they get three. But this is the same choice you guys just faced. Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial  or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky  but big  bonus  but risk the possibility of getting no bonus. People here played it safe. Turns out  the monkeys play it safe too. Qualitatively and quantitatively  they choose exactly the same way as people  when tested in the same thing. You might say  well  maybe the monkeys just don't like risk. Maybe we should see how they do with losses. And so we ran a second version of this. Now  the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses  they're actually giving them less than they expect. So they look like they're starting out with a big amount. These are three grapes  the monkey's really psyched for this. But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect. They guy on the left is a safe loss. Every single time  he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two. the guy on the right is the risky loss. Sometimes he gives no loss  so the monkeys are really psyched  but sometimes he actually gives a big loss  taking away two to give the monkeys only one. And so what do the monkeys do  Again  same choice  they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time  or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three. The remarkable thing to us is that  when you give monkeys this choice  they do the same irrational thing that people do. They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started. This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains. So what does all of this mean  Well  what we've shown is that  first of all  we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency  and they do very similar things with it. They do some of the smart things we do  some of the kind of not so nice things we do  like steal it and so on. But they also do some of the irrational things we do. They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do. This is the first take home message of the Talk  which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought  oh  I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser. They're way cuter than the one at ... you know    Don't do that  they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have. So  you know  a little bad    Sorry  sorry  sorry. A little bad for monkey investors. But of course  you know  the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too. Because we've answered the question we started out with. We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from. And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions  tweak our technologies to make ourselves better. But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that. In fact  they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history. You know  maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey. Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back. And this  if we believe the capuchin monkey results  means that these duncey strategies might be    million years old. That's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around    really  really old. What do we know about other old strategies like this  Well  one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome. You know  think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things  fatty things like cheesecake. You can't just shut that off. You can't just look at the dessert cart as say   No  no  no. That looks disgusting to me.  We're just built differently. We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after. My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions. When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red  when you're watching your house price go down  you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms. This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly  that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome. So that's the bad news. The question is  is there any good news  I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news. Well  the good news  I think  is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk  which is that humans are not only smart  we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom. We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations    you know  I flew over here in an airplane. I didn't have to try to flap my wings. I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you. I don't have to rely on my own near sightedness. We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means  seemingly pretty easily. But we have to recognize that we have those limitations. And here's the rub. It was Camus who once said that   Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is.  But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them. The hope is that you all will think about your limitations  not necessarily as unovercomable  but to recognize them  accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out. That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be. Thank you. Last year when I was here  I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole. And while that swim took place three years ago  I can remember it as if it was yesterday. I remember standing on the edge of the ice  about to dive into the water  and thinking to myself  I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening. The water is completely black. The water is minus  .  degrees centigrade  or    degrees Fahrenheit. It's flipping freezing in that water. And then a thought came across my mind  if things go pear shaped on this swim  how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean  And then I said to myself  I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible. And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up  listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy  and then committing myself a hundred percent    there is nothing more powerful than the made up mind    and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water. And that swim took me    minutes and    seconds  and it felt like    days. And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers  and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because    you know  we're made partially of water    when water freezes it expands  and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst. And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following  I'm never  ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again. Anyway  last year  I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the     Laughter  and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change. I heard about this lake  Lake Imja. This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier. The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake. And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great  big battleground on this earth. Nearly two billion people    so one in three people on this earth    rely on the water from the Himalayas. And with a population increasing as quickly as it is  and with the water supply from these glaciers    because of climate change    decreasing so much  I think we have a real risk of instability. North  you've got China  south  you've India  Pakistan  Bangladesh  all these countries. And so I decided to walk up to Mt. Everest  the highest mountain on this earth  and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt. Everest. Now  I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest  but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.    great  big  powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain    I don't just have my Speedo  but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world. The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude. I wanted to do the swim at       meters above sea level. So it's right up in the heavens. It's very  very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness. I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time. That's not the worst part of it. The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest. Many  many people have died on Mt. Everest  and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain. And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before  and  in fact  no fish    there are no fish up there swimming at       meters    When you're trying to do that  and then the bodies are coming past you  it humbles you  and you also realize very  very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are. And we walked up this pathway  all the way up. And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier. And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice. And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest  and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself  for this swim which was going to be so very difficult. I put on my iPod  I listened to some music  I got myself as aggressive as possible    but controlled aggression    and then I hurled myself into that water. I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters  and then I realized very  very quickly  I had a huge problem on my hands. I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air. I then began to choke  and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water. And it all happened so quickly  I then    I don't know how it happened    but I went underwater. And luckily  the water was quite shallow  and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air. And then I said  carry on. Carry on. Carry on. I carried on for another five or six strokes  and then I had nothing in my body  and I went down to the bottom of the lake. And I don't where I got it from  but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake. I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have. I have never  ever heard such utter bollocks. It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have. I got myself to the side of the lake. My crew grabbed me  and then we walked as quickly as we could down    over the rubble    down to our camp. And there  we sat down  and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest. And my team just gave it to me straight. They said  Lewis  you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim. Every single thing which you have learned in the past    years of swimming  you must forget. Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army  about speed and aggression  you put that to one side. We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time. Take some time to rest and think about things. We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time  and instead of swimming fast  swim as slowly as possible. Instead of swimming crawl  swim breaststroke. And remember  never ever swim with aggression. This is the time to swim with real humility. And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later. And I stood there on the edge of the lake  and I looked up at Mt. Everest    and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth    and I said to myself  just do this slowly. And I swam across the lake. And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side. But I learned two very  very important lessons there on Mt. Everest  and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this. The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well  doesn't mean it's going to work in the future. And similarly  now  before I do anything  I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task. And taking that into the world of climate change    which is  frankly  the Mt. Everest of all problems    just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long  just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long  doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on. The warning signs are all there. When I was born  the world's population was  .  billion people. We're now  .  billion people  and we're expected to be   billion people by     . And then the second lesson  the radical  tactical shift. And I've come here to ask you today  what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment  which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world  and most importantly  in a sustainable world  And I ask you  please  to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make  which will make that big difference  and then commit a hundred percent to doing it. Blog about it  tweet about it  talk about it  and commit a hundred percent  because very  very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it. So thank you very  very much.
