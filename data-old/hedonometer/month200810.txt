I want to argue to you that in fact  politics and religion  which are the two primary factors    not the sole  but overwhelmingly  the primary factors    which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely    bordering on the inevitable at this point  whether one is in favor of that or not    that politics and religion are  in fact  themselves better conceptualized as kinds of technology  and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider in the space of conceptual design. Here's what I mean. Politics and    let's focus on the political system in particular question here  which is the system of democracy. Democracy  as a type of politics  is a technology for the control and deployment of power. You can deploy power in a wide range of ways. The famous ones    despotism is a good one  anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way  to do it in a radically diffused fashion  and democracy is a set of technologies  which have the effect of  in principle  diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern  and who themselves are  in principle  authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader public has done. Now  consider religion    in this case Islam  which is the religion that  in some direct sense  can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter. Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case  because I think it's a potentially controversial statement. I would put it in the following equation  no       no war. At the beginning of the Bush administration  when President Bush  now President Bush  was running for president  he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world. In fact  the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world. That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol  for example. After       the tables were turned. And the president decided  with his advisors  to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us. That began with Afghanistan  and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly  a decision was made through the technology of democracy    again  notice  not a perfect technology    but through the technology of democracy that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war    this time  a war in Iraq. Now  the reason I begin by saying  no       no war  is that we have to acknowledge that Islam  as interpreted by a very  very small  extremely radical group of people  was a precipitating cause of the      attacks    the precipitating cause of the      attacks    and as a consequence  at one degree of remove  the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in. And I would add that bin Laden and his followers are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy  or at least capitalist democracy  on the one hand  and the world of Islam as they see and define it. Now  how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus  Well  it's a technology for  first  salvation in its most basic sense. It's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer  but it's also meant by the Islamists    and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam    they follow the slogan  Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions  whether they're social  or political  or personal  or spiritual. Within the sphere of people who have that view  and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world who disagree with bin Laden in his application  but agree that Islam is the answer. Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals. And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are  in principle  peace  justice and equality  but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings. Now  I don't want to leave a misimpression by identifying either of these propositions    rather  either of these phenomena  democracy or Islam    as technologies. I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to. And I think a good way to prove this is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke. And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem  you can't show a picture of democracy. You can show a slogan  or a symbol  or a sign that stands for democracy. You can show the Capitol    I had the same problem when I was designing the cover of my forthcoming book  in fact    what do you put on the cover to show democracy  And the same problem with respect to Islam. You can show a mosque  or you can show worshippers  but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam. That's because these are the kinds of concepts that are not susceptible to easy representation. Now  it follows from that  that they're deeply contestable. It follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are Muslims can  in principle  subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations of what Islam really is  and the same is true of democracy. In other words  unlike the word hope  which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for  and  perhaps  reach some kind of a consensual use analysis  these are essentially contested concepts. They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense. And as a consequence of this disagreement  it's very  very difficult for anyone to say   I have the right version of Islam.  You know  post       we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of George W. Bush saying   Islam means peace.  Well  so says George W. Bush. Other people would say it means something else. Some people would say that Islam means submission. Other people would say it means an acknowledgement or recognition of God's sovereignty. There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean. And ostensibly  the same is true of democracy. Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections. Other people say no  that's not enough  there have to be basic liberal rights  free speech  free press  equality of citizens. These are contested points  and it's impossible to answer them by saying   Ah ha  I looked in the right place  and I found out what these concepts mean.  Now  if Islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation  what does that mean  Well  you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks. You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago  which was fear. Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner and with a very  very high likelihood that many  many people are going to die as a consequence of this confrontation    a confrontation which many  many people in the Muslim world do not want  many  many people in the American democracy do not want  many people elsewhere in the world do not want  but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people    at least in the relevant space  which is the United States    to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all. And I think that that's  in fact  probably the first appropriate response. What I want to suggest to you  though  in the next couple of minutes is that there's also a hopeful response to this. And the hopeful response derives from recognizing that Islam and democracy are technologies. And by virtue of being technologies  they're manipulable. And they're manipulable in ways that can produce some extremely positive outcomes. What do I have in mind  Well  all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously  people who care about Islam  for whom it's a source either of faith  or of civilization  or of deep values  or just a source of powerful personal identity  who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict  but are in fact deeply compatible. And these Muslims    and it's the vast majority of Muslims    disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach  profoundly. And they furthermore think overwhelmingly    again one can't speak of every person  but overwhelmingly  and one can find this by reading any of the sources that they have produced  and they're all over the Internet and in all sorts of languages    one can see that they're saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life  in the sphere of economics  in the sphere of politics  and  yes  in the sphere of religion  which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world. And many of these Muslims further say that their disagreement with the United States is that it  in the past and still in the present  has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world in order to promote America's short term interests. Now  during the Cold War  that may have been a defensible position for the United States to take. That's an academic question. It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East  and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism. And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other  and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them. But now that the Cold War is over  there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world    and pretty close to the same here in the United States  if you talk to people and ask them    that in principle  there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co exist. And we see this among activist  practical Muslims  like the Muslims who are presently the elected  parliamentary  democratic government of Turkey  who are behaving pragmatically  not ideologically  who are promoting their own religious values  who are elected by their own people because they were perceived as honest and sincere because of their religious values  but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance are fundamentally incompatible. Now  you may say  but surely  what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy    namely  free political choice  basic liberty and basic equality. But I'm here to tell you that technologies are more malleable than that. I'm here to tell you that many  many Muslims believe    the vast majority  in fact    in fact I think I would go so far as to say that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam  namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty and basic human equality before God  are themselves compatible with liberty  equality and free political choice. And there are Muslims  many Muslims out there  who are saying precisely this. And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it. But their governments  needless to say  are relatively threatened by this. And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument. So  for example  a group of young activists in Egypt try to form a party known as the Center Party  which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy. They weren't even allowed to form a party. They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there. Why  Because they would have done extraordinarily well. In the most recent elections in the Muslim world    which are those in Pakistan  those in Morocco and those in Turkey    in each case  people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats were far and away the most successful vote getters every place they were allowed to run freely. So in Morocco  for example  they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats. So had they contested a larger number of the seats  they would have done even better. Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims    who care very  very deeply about their traditions  who do not want to compromise those values    believe  through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam  that these two ideas can work together. Now what would that look like  What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy  Well  one thing is  it's not going to look identical to democracy as we know it in the United States. That may be a good thing  in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today    for example  in the regulatory context    of what democracy produces. It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room  or Muslims out in the rest of the world    I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here  there probably are    conceptualize Islam. It will be transformative of Islam as well. And as a result of this convergence  this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together  there's a real possibility that  instead of a clash of Islamic civilization    if there is such a thing    and democratic civilization    if there is such a thing    we'll in fact have close compatibility. Now  I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room  and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues. The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war  many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government. On the other hand  there's a further possibility that many Americans  swept up in the fever of a war  will say  and feel  and think that Islam is the enemy somehow    that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy. And even though  for political tactical reasons  the president has been very  very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy  nonetheless  there's a natural impulse when one enters war to think of the other side as an enemy. And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize  as much as possible  in defining who that enemy is. So the risks are very great. On the other hand  the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated  even by  and I would say especially by  people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place. Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens  it cannot be the right strategy  either pragmatically  or spiritually  or morally  to say after the war   Well  let's let it all run itself out  and play out however it wants to play out  because we opposed the war in the first place.  That's not the way human circumstances operate. You face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward. Well  what I'm here to say then is  for people who are skeptical about the war  it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the United States and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly Islamic. And it is crucial    it is crucial in a practical  activist way    for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy  in this system  they exercise their preferences  their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome. That's a hopeful message  but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us. And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation  but only if we put what we can into it. And if we do  then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether. Thanks. Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space  architecture is nothing but a special effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses. Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes. It's small and large. This is an ashtray  a water glass. From urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff. The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space. And these are everyday conventions  conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity. And I've assembled a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect. And that is something like nothing  or something next to nothing. It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through. This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo      on Lake Neuchatel  near Geneva. And we wanted to use the water not only as a context  but as a primary building material. We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere. So  no walls  no roof  no purpose    just a mass of atomized water  a big cloud. And this proposal was a reaction to the over saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions  which feeds  or has been feeding  our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity. High definition  in our opinion  has become the new orthodoxy. And we ask the question  can we use technology  high technology  to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition  that also challenges the conventions of space and skin  and rethinks our dependence on vision  So this is how we sought to do it. Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high pressure fog nozzles         of them. And a weather station is on the structure. It reads the shifting conditions of temperature  humidity  wind direction  wind speed  dew point  and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout. And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather. So  this is just in construction  and there's a tensegrity structure. It's about     feet wide  the size of a football field  and it sits on just four very delicate columns. These are the fog nozzles  the interface  and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather  and producing kind of semi artificial and real weather. So  we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why. Now  here we go  one side  the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was. Unlike entering any normal space  entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium. It's formless  featureless  depthless  scaleless  massless  purposeless and dimensionless. All references are erased  leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles. So  this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do. And we pride ourselves    it's a spectacular anti spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head. So  the audience is dispersed  focused attention and dramatic build up and climax are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog. And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way. So here the world is put out of focus  while our visual dependence is put into focus. The public  you know  once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar. So  all the waters of the world are served there  so we thought that  you know  after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water  you could also drink this building. And so it is sort of a theme  but it goes a little bit  you know  deeper than that. We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense  and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses. You know  when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell  because the Swiss said   Well  why are we going to spend  you know     million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate   And  you know  we thought    well  we tried to convince them. And in the end  you know  they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt  which we    you know  it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of. Anyway  it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed  and so it's now a memory of an apparition  actually  but it continues to live in edible form. And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland    to have a chocolate bar. Anyway  moving along. So in the '  s and '  s  we were mostly known for independent work  such as installation artist  architect  commissioned projects by museums and non for profit organizations. And we did a lot of media work  also a lot of experimental theater projects. In       the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '  s and '  s. However  the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective  and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show. This was a piece on tourism in the United States. This is  Soft Sell  for   nd Street. This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.  Master Slave  at the MOMA  the project series  a piece called  Parasite.  And so there were many  many of these kinds of projects. Anyway  they gave us the whole fourth floor  and  you know  the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with. It's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work. And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all. And one of the recurring themes  by the way  that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself  and asking about the conventions of the museum  like the wall  the white wall. So  what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there. And we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces  which didn't belong together. But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time. We used the wall to partition the    installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation. And what you see is    actually  the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element  which was a new piece that created    that we created for the    which was a robotic drill  basically  that went all the way around  cruised the museum  went all around the walls and did a lot of damage. So  the drill was mounted on this robotic arm. We worked with  by the way  Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain. Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller  and it was really very much fun to work with them. They weren't doing their primary work  which was for the government  while they were helping us with this. In any case  the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls. So  unfolded it's about     linear feet. And it randomly generates points within a three dimensional matrix. It selects a point  it guides the drill to that point  it pierces the dry wall  leaving a half inch hole before traveling to the next location. Initially these holes were lone blemishes  and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated. So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned  opening views from gallery to gallery. Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall. And so this was a three month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element. And also the acoustic separation was destroyed. Also the visual separation. And there was also this constant background groan  which was very annoying. And this is one of the blackout spaces where there's a video piece that became totally not useful. So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display  the wall now actively competed for attention. And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective. It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text. Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago. It's the ICA    the Institute of Contemporary Art    in Boston  which is on the waterfront. And there's not enough time to really introduce the building  but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site    you know  it's a really great waterfront site in Boston    and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum. So  the nature of the building is that it looks at looking    I mean that's its primary objective  both its program and its architectural conceit. The building incorporates the site  but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed. So  you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater  by the belly of the theater  into this very compressed space where the view is turned off. Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall. This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment. And then  this is a view going up  and then you could come into the theater  which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop. And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open. The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light  and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view. The original intention of this space  which was unfortunately never realized  was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out. In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax  but to have the view stalk you  so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other. This was eliminated because the view was too good  and the mayor said   No  we just want this open.  The architect lost here. But culminating    and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk    is this Mediatheque  which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building. So this is an    foot cantilever    it's quite substantial. So  it's already sticking out into space enough  and then from that is this  is this small area called the Mediatheque. The Mediatheque has something like    stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web. And this was really a kind of very important part of this building  and here is a point where architecture    this is like technology free    architecture is only a framing device  it only edits the harbor view  the industrial harbor just through its walls  its floors and its ceiling  to only expose the water itself  the texture of water  much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that. And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project. But there is just no information  it's just    it's just hypnosis. Moving along to Lincoln Center. These are the guys that did the project in the first place     years ago. We're taking over now  doing work that ranges in scale from small scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions. But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone. This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by     . And for the purposes of this talk  I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects  and it happens to be our current obsession  and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction. It's Alice Tully Hall  and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street. So  this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be  before the renovation  which we just started. And we asked ourselves  why couldn't it be exhibitionistic  like the Met  or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center  And one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity  expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible. And this building  which is just naturally hermetic  we stripped. We basically did a striptease  architectural striptease  where we're framing with this kind of canopy    the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard  about        square feet    cutting it to the angle of Broadway  and then exposing  using that canopy to frame Tully Hall. Before and after shot.  Applause  Wait a minute  it's just in that state  we have a long way to go. But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself  which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work. So  the hall is a multi purpose hall. The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall. Now  that's really tough to do with a hall that has       seats. Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy. How do you bring an intimacy into a hall  Intimacy for us means a lot of different things. It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy. One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall. Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall. It's like a coffin  it basically sends all the sound  like a gutter ball effect  down the aisles. The walls are made of absorptive surface  half absorptive  half reflective  which is not very good for concert sound. This is Avery Fisher Hall  but the notion of junk    visual junk    was very  very important to us  to get rid of visual noise. Because we can't eliminate a single seat  the architecture is restricted to    inches. So it's a very  very thin architecture. First we do a kind of partial box and box separation  to take away the distraction of the subway noise. Next we wrap the entire hall    almost like this Olivetti keyboard    with a material  with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces  wall  ceiling  floor  stage  steps  everything  boxes. But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf. Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage. Just everything is lined  it incorporates    every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high performance skin. But one more added feature. So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction  everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house  the audience  with the performers  we add one little detail  one piece of architectural excess  a special effect  lighting. We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts. So what we wanted to do was produce this effect  this lighting effect  which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls. And what it entails is the use of resin  of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall  in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light  like a belt of light  rather than separating  like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers  it connects audience with players. And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full scale. And this is a guy from Salt Lake City  this is what they look like out there. And for us  I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing  but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin  very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier  the walls will just exude this glow  temporarily stealing attention from the stage. And this is Tully in construction now. I have no ending to say  except that I'm a couple of minutes over. Thank you very much. I was a student in the '  s  a time of social upheaval and questioning  and    on a personal level    an awakening sense of idealism. The war in Vietnam was raging  the Civil Rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me. Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another. I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans. Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism. They not only recorded history    they helped change the course of history. Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and  as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience  change became not only possible  but inevitable. It puts a human face on issues which  from afar  can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact. What happens at ground level  far from the halls of power  happens to ordinary citizens one by one. And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. My TED wish. There s a vital story that needs to be told and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era. Thank you very much.     . .      The story breaks.      I have been a witness  and these pictures are my testimony.      South Africa     This is happening now.

I grew up in Northern Ireland  right up in the very  very north end of it there  where it's absolutely freezing cold. This was me running around in the back garden mid summer. I couldn't pick a career. In Ireland the obvious choice is the military  but to be honest it actually kind of sucks. My mother wanted me to be a dentist. But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up. So I actually went to school in Belfast  which was where all the action happened. And this was a pretty common sight. The school I went to was pretty boring. They forced us to learn things like Latin. The school teachers weren't having much fun  the sports were very dirty or very painful. So I cleverly chose rowing  which I got very good at. And I was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day  and I flipped over right in front of the entire school. And that was the finishing post right there. So this was extremely embarrassing. But our school at that time got a grant from the government  and they got an incredible computer    the research machine  DZ    and they left the programming manuals lying around. And so students like myself with nothing to do  we would learn how to program it. Also around this time  at home  this was the computer that people were buying. It was called the Sinclair ZX  . This was a  K computer  and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape. Actually I'm just going to pause for one second  because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED    you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair. So I brought a picture with big hair. I just want to get that out of the way. So after the Sinclair ZX   came along the very cleverly named Sinclair ZX  . And    you see the picture at the bottom  There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son. That's what they thought they had built it for. The reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it. We were programming in BASIC  which is a pretty awful language for games  so we ended up learning Assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware. This is the guy that invented it  Sir Clive Sinclair  and he's showing his machine. You had this same thing in America  it was called the Timex Sinclair    . To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing  Battlestar Galactica.  The graphics were just horrible. You had to have an even better imagination to play this game   Death Rider.  But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves. They started making their own video games. This is one of my favorite ones here  where they have rabbit breeding  so males choose the lucky rabbit. It was around this time we went from  K to   K  which was quite the leap. And if you're wondering how much   K is  this eBay logo here is   K. And in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program. And that's what it looked like. I spent ages flying this flight simulator  and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it. Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer. He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe. He's a multi millionaire  and I think that's why he's smiling in this photograph. So I went on for the next    years or so making a lot of different games. Some of the highlights were things like  The Terminator    Aladdin   the  Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.  Because I was from the United Kingdom  they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children  so they decided to call it hero instead. I personally preferred the Spanish version  which was  Tortugas Ninja.  That was much better. Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry and Hollywood to actually work together on something    instead of licensing from each other  to actually work. Now  Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me  so I've done that. The video game industry in      became a    billion dollar business. It grows every year. Last year was the biggest year. By       we're going to kick the butt of the music industry. By       we're going to hit    billion.    percent of gamers are female. So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware. The average age of gamers  Well  obviously it's for children  right  Well  no  actually it's    years old. And interestingly  the people who buy the most games are   . So    is our target audience. All video games are violent. Of course the newspapers love to beat on this. But    percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever  so it's just not true. Online gaming statistics. I brought some stuff on  World of Warcraft.  It's  .  million players. It makes about    million bucks a month in subscriptions. It costs    bucks just to install it on your computer  making the publisher about another     million. The game costs about    million dollars to make  so basically it pays for itself in about a month. A player in a game called  Project Entropia  actually bought his own island for        dollars. You have to remember that this is not a real island. He didn't actually buy anything  just some data. But he got great terms on it. This purchase included mining and hunting rights  ownership of all land on the island  and a castle with no furniture included. This market is now estimated at over     million dollars annually. And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves. They found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games. I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on  typed in World of Warcraft  got       items. I liked this one the best  a level    Warlock with lots of epics for         dollars. It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it. So as far as popularity of games  what do you think these people are doing here  It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music. That's what the show looks like. You would expect it to be cheesy  but it's not. It's very  very epic and a very beautiful concert. And the people that went there absolutely loved it. What do you think these people are doing  They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other. And this is happening in every city around the world. This is happening in your local cities too  you're probably just not aware of it. Now  Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving. I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it. But what I want you to do is to try to understand it. We're on this curve  and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better. And I'm going to show you up to maybe     . But I want you to try and think about what games could look like    years from now. So we're going to start that video. Video  Throughout human history people have played games. As man's intellect and technology have evolved so too have the games he plays. David Perry  The thing again I want you to think about is  don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is. Think about that's where we are right now  and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue to get better. This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today. You need to be really an incredible artist. And once we get enough of those guys  we're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we've never been to before  or characters that we've just never seen before. So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio. But if you were to go to a game developers conference  what they're all talking about is emotion  purpose  meaning  understanding and feeling. You'll hear about talks like  can a video game make you cry  And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about. I came across a student who's absolutely excellent at expressing himself  and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at TED had seen it. So I'd like to play this video. So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are. Video  I  like many of you  live somewhere between reality and video games. Some part of me    a true living  breathing person    has become programmed  electronic and virtual. The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble. I'm a video game addict and this is my story. In the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development. I played in the backyard  learned to read  and even ate some of my vegetables. Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos. But as was the case for most of my generation  I spent a lot of time in front of the TV. Mr. Rogers  Walt Disney  Nick Junior  and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me. When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo  whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me. At some point something clicked. With the combination of simple  interactive stories and the warmth of the TV set  my simple    bit Nintendo became more than just an escape. It became an alternate existence  my virtual reality. I'm a video game addict  and it's not because of a certain number of hours I have spent playing  or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level. It is because I have had life altering experiences in virtual space  and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not. I'm addicted  because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality  I still crave more. From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen. Today  after    years of watching TV geared to make me emotional  even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes. I am just one of a new generation that is growing up. A generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world. Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap  a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres  or the news we watch on TV. And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited  what I do learn applies to my real life. Play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard  fly a plane  drive a nine second quarter mile  or kill a man. I know I can. Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it  video games actually allow us to become part of the machine. They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive  downloaded  streaming  HD reality. We are interacting with our entertainment. I have come to expect this level of interaction. Without it  the problems faced in the real world    poverty  war  disease and genocide    lack the levity they should. Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV. But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics  the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound. It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional. I have fought in wars  feared for my own survival  watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story. The people who create these games are smart. They know what makes me scared  excited  panicked  proud or sad. Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create. A well designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience. As one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts away. I know what I want and I do it. No buttons to push  no triggers to pull  just me and the game. My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands. I know violent video games make my mother worry. What troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence  but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game. These are all troubles outside of myself. I  however  have a problem very close to home. Something has happened to my brain. Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts  the things we know to do before we even think. While some of these instincts may be innate  most are learned  and all of them are hardwired into our brains. These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds. Only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli. As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life  only virtually. Consider this    my real life car has about        miles on it. In all my driving games  I've driven a total of        miles. To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game. The sensory cues are very similar. It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the TV than you have in real life. When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is  this is almost as beautiful as my games are. For my virtual worlds are perfect. More beautiful and rich than the real world around us. I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are  but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me. Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply TVs. Video games are fun  engaging  and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re programming. But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad. Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other  or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing in the real world. There is a potential to do good as well. It is critical  as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in  that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them. I'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization. But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way I do. What I have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics  sound  game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me. I know that I am losing my grip. Part of me is just waiting to let go. I know though  that no matter how amazing video games may become  or how flat the real world may seem to us  that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug. DP  Wow. I found that video very  very thought provoking  and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see. And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio. But as you heard  Michael talked about all these other elements as well. Video games give an awful lot of other things too  and that's why people get so addicted. The most important one being fun. The name of this track is  The Magic To Come.  Who is that going to come from  Is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would  I don't think so. I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past. They're going to do it their way  using the tools that we've created. The same with students or highly creative people  writers and people like that. As far as colleges go  there's about     colleges around the world teaching video game courses. That means there's literally thousands of new ideas. Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great. There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and pitch you a really bad video game idea. Chris Anderson  You're off  you're off. That's it. He's out of time. DP  I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me. CA  Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though. DP  This is just a cool shot  because this is students coming to school after class. The school is closed  they're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video game ideas. I'm sitting at the front of the class  and they're actually pitching their ideas. So it's hard to get students to come back to class  but it is possible. This is my daughter  her name's Emma  she's    months old. And I've been asking myself  what is Emma going to experience in the video game world  And as I've shown here  we have the audience. She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button and have millions of people ready to play. You know  we have the technology. She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't stunning and really immersive. And as the student video showed  we can impact and move. She's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry. I just hope she likes video games. So  my closing thought. Games on the surface seem simple entertainment  but for those that like to look a little deeper  the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers to creative minds that like to think big. Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED  Thank you. Chris Anderson  David Perry. That was awesome. So  indeed  I have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive. Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning  thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night. But when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life  my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson. He taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms  work  love and play. And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other  is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age. Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication  is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement  but with serenity. So since I tell stories  let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point    Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson. As for that first sphere of work  I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing. He had a huge ambition. But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame    what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it. Even as a child  it seemed  Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams. He somehow had to escape that hard scrabble farm from which he was born. No schooling was possible for him  except a few weeks here  a few weeks there. But he read books in every spare moment he could find. It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or  Aesop's Fables   he was so excited he couldn't sleep. He couldn't eat. The great poet Emily Dickinson once said   There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away.  How true for Lincoln. Though he never would travel to Europe  he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England  he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal. Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings. But there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death. His mother died when he was only nine years old  his only sister  Sarah  in childbirth a few years later  and his first love  Ann Rutledge  at the age of   . Moreover  when his mother lay dying  she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld. She simply said to him   Abraham  I'm going away from you now  and I shall never return.  As a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away    dust to dust. But only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion    but followed by other cultures as well    that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life  you could live on in the memory of others. Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence. And that worthy ambition became his lodestar. It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early   s. Three things had combined to lay him low. He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd  not certain he was ready to marry her  but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that. His one intimate friend  Joshua Speed  was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died. And his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide. He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal. They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room. And his great friend Speed went to his side and said   Lincoln  you must rally or you will die.  He said that   I would just as soon die right now  but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived.  So fueled by that ambition  he returned to the state legislature. He eventually won a seat in Congress. He then ran twice for the Senate  lost twice.  Everyone is broken by life   Ernest Hemingway once said   but some people are stronger in the broken places.  So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced  far more educated  far more celebrated rivals. And then when he won the general election  he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet. It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought   He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people.  They said   Why are you doing this  Lincoln   He said   Look  these are the strongest and most able men in the country. The country is in peril. I need them by my side.  But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion   Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out  than outside the tent pissing in.  But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team. For each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external r sum . For one thing  he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view. He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility. He shared credit with ease  assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates  constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes. These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in     . He refused to be provoked by petty grievances. He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights. And he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language  in metaphors  in stories. And with a beauty of language    almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul. In       when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed  he brought his old friend  Joshua Speed  back to the White House  and remembered that conversation of decades before  when he was so sad. And he  pointing to the Proclamation  said   I believe  in this measure  my fondest hopes will be realized.  But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception. So he put the pen down. He said   If ever my soul were in an act  it is in this act. But if I sign with a shaking hand  posterity will say  'He hesitated.'  So he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand. But even in his wildest dreams  Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach. I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer  Leo Tolstoy  in a New York newspaper in the early     s. And in it  Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus  where there were only wild barbarians  who had never left this part of Russia. Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst  they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history. So he said   I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great and Julius Caesar  and they loved it. But before I finished  the chief of the barbarians stood up and said  'But wait  you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all. We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder  who laughed like the sunrise  who came from that place called America  which is so far from here  that if a young man should travel there  he would be an old man when he arrived. Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'  He was stunned. He told them everything he could about Lincoln. And then in the interview he said   What made Lincoln so great  Not as great a general as Napoleon  not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great.  But his greatness consisted  and historians would roundly agree  in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being. So in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized. That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself  to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war. His story would be told. So as for that second sphere  not of work  but of love    encompassing family  friends and colleagues    it  too  takes work and commitment. The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life  when I helped him on his memoirs  was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work  power and individual success  that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone. My relationship with him began on a rather curious level. I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was    years old. We had a big dance at the White House. President Johnson did dance with me that night. Not that peculiar    there were only three women out of the    White House Fellows. But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House. But it was not to be that simple. For in the months leading up to my selection  like many young people  I'd been active in the anti Vietnam War movement  and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson  which unfortunately came out in The New Republic two days after the dance in the White House. And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power. So I was certain he would kick me out of the program. But instead  surprisingly  he said   Oh  bring her down here for a year  and if I can't win her over  no one can.  So I did end up working for him in the White House. Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs  never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with. I like to believe it was because I was a good listener. He was a great storyteller. Fabulous  colorful  anecdotal stories. There was a problem with these stories  however  which I later discovered  which is that half of them weren't true. But they were great  nonetheless. So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales. But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman. And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation. So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends  even when I didn't have any at all. Everything was working perfectly  until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship. Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake  conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson. And there was wine and cheese and a red checked tablecloth    all the romantic trappings. And he started out   Doris  more than any other woman I have ever known ...   And my heart sank. And then he said   You remind me of my mother.  It was pretty embarrassing  given what was going on in my mind. But I must say  the older I've gotten  the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man. A victor in a thousand contests  three great civil rights laws  Medicare  aid to education. And yet  roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam. And because he was so sad and so vulnerable  he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power    sharing his fears  his sorrows and his worries. And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure  that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then. But it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life. For on the surface  Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years  in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency  he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted  he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside  a penthouse in the city  sailboats  speedboats. He had servants to answer any whim  and he had a family who loved him deeply. And yet  years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family  in recreation  in sports or in hobbies. It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family  without work  could not fill it. As his spirits sagged  his body deteriorated until  I believe  he slowly brought about his own death. In those last years  he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him. He spoke with immense sadness in his voice  saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children  and their children in turn. But it was too late. Despite all that power  all that wealth  he was alone when he finally died    his ultimate terror realized. So as for that third sphere of play  which he never had learned to enjoy  I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy    enough so that a hobby  a sport  a love of music  or art  or literature  or any form of recreation  can provide true pleasure  relaxation and replenishment. So deep  for instance  was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare  that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater  even during those dark days of the war. He said  when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on  for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time. But an even more important form of relaxation for him  that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy  was a love of    somehow    humor  and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness. He once said that he laughed so he did not cry  that a good story  for him  was better than a drop of whiskey. His storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois. The lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other  and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town  they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories. He would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales. And all these stories became part of his memory bank  so he could call on them whenever he needed to. And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument. One of his favorite stories  for example  had to do with the Revolutionary War hero  Ethan Allen. And as Lincoln told the story  Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war. And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution  so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse  where he'd have to encounter it. They figured he'd be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse. But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all. And so they said   Well  did you see George Washington in there    Oh  yes   he said   perfectly appropriate place for him.   What do you mean   they said.  Well   he said   there's nothing to make an Englishman shit faster than the sight of General George Washington.  So you can imagine  if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting    and he had hundreds of these stories    you would have to relax. So between his nightly treks to the theater  his story telling  and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry  he found that form of play which carried him through his days. In my own life  I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball. Which allows me  from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall  to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work. It all began when I was only six years old  and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games    so that when he went to work in New York during the day  I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodgers game. Now  when you're only six years old  and your father comes home every single night and listens to you    as I now realize that I  in excruciating detail  recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon. But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story. It makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention. In fact  I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father. Because at first  I'd be so excited I would blurt out   The Dodgers won   or   The Dodgers lost   Which took much of the drama of this two hour telling away. So I finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end. I must say  so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball. The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher  Roy Campanella  came to my hometown of Rockville Centre  Long Island  just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion. And I was so excited    first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field. But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church. When you are brought up as a Catholic  you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church  you'll be struck dead at the threshold. So I went to my father in tears   What are we going to do   He said   Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall. We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship. It's not a sin.  But as I left that night  I was certain that somehow I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella. And there were no indulgences around that I could buy. So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession. I told the priest right away. He said   No problem. It wasn't a religious service.  But then  unfortunately  he said   And what else  my child   And then came my second sin. I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church  wishing harm to others  being mean to my sisters. And he said   To whom did you wish harm   And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players would break arms  legs and ankles       so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series. He said   How often do you make these horrible wishes   And I had to say  every night when I said my prayers. So he said   Look  I'll tell you something. I love the Brooklyn Dodgers  as you do  but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely. You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen.   Oh yes   I said. But luckily  my first confession    to a baseball loving priest  Well  though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my   s  before I had gotten married and had my three sons  I have passed his memory    as well as his love of baseball    on to my boys. Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.  I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston and became an irrational Red Socks fan. And I must say  even now  when I sit with my sons with our season tickets  I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself  a young girl once more  in the presence of my father  watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below  Jackie Robinson  Roy Campanella  Pee Wee Reese  and Duke Snider. I must say there is magic in these moments. When I open my eyes and I see my sons in the place where my father once sat  I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see  but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told. Which is why  in the end  I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history  allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past. Allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life. Allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families  and the public figures we have respected in our history  just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe  really can live on  so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives. Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today. Thank you. I want to take you back basically to my hometown  and to a picture of my hometown of the week that  Emergence  came out. And it's a picture we've seen several times. Basically   Emergence  was published on     . I live right there in the West Village  so the plume was luckily blowing west  away from us. We had a two and a half day old baby in the house that was ours    we hadn't taken it from somebody else. And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby  and having this event happen so close    that my first thought  when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building  was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written. Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density  of largely urban density  of connecting people and putting them together in one place  and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together. And it seemed to me looking at that    that tower burning and then falling  those towers burning and falling    that in fact  one of the lessons here was that density kills. And that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being  probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that enable        people to live in two buildings     stories above the ground. If they hadn't been crowded    you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers  and you can see that very powerfully. And so I started to think  well  you know  density  density    I'm not sure if  you know  this was the right call. And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days. And then about two days later  the wind started to change a little bit  and you could sense that the air was not healthy. And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village where we lived  my wife sent me out to buy a  you know  a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond  which was located about    blocks away  north. And so I went out. And obviously I'm physically a very strong person  as you can tell     Laughter     so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing    blocks. And I walked out  and this really miraculous thing happened to me as I was walking north to buy this air filter  which was that the streets were completely alive with people. There was an incredible    it was  you know  a beautiful day  as it was for about a week after  and the West Village had never seemed more lively. I walked up along Hudson Street    where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what I was writing in  Emergence     past the White Horse Tavern  that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death  and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids. And all the people who lived in the neighborhood  who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood  were all out there    had them all open. People were out. There were no cars  so it seemed even better  in some ways. And it was a beautiful urban day  and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working. The city was there. All the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating    they were all on display there on those streets. And I thought  well  this is the power of a city. I mean  the power of the city    we talked about cities as being centralized in space  but what makes them so strong most of the time is they're decentralized in function. They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail. If they did  it probably was right there at Ground Zero. I mean  you know  the emergency bunker was right there  was destroyed by the attacks  and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives. But nonetheless  just    blocks north  two days later  the city had never looked more alive. If you'd gone into the minds of the people  well  you would have seen a lot of trauma  and you would have seen a lot of heartache  and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover. But the system itself of this city was thriving. So I took heart in seeing that. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well  and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now. The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is    when you've talked about emergent behavior  when you've talked about collective intelligence  the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask  who builds a neighborhood  Who decides that Soho should have this personality and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality  Well  there are some kind of executive decisions  but mostly the answer is    everybody and nobody. Everybody contributes a little bit. No single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood. Same thing to the question of  who was keeping the streets alive post      in my neighborhood  Well  it was the whole city. The whole system kind of working on it  and everybody contributing a small little part. And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways    most of which weren't around  actually  except in very experimental things  when I was writing  Emergence  and when the book came out. So it's been a very optimistic time  I think  and I want to just talk about a few of those things. I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that's starting to emerge online right now. And the old one looked like this. This is not the future King of England  although it looks like it. It's some guy  it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online who's interested  if you look at the bottom  in soccer and Jesus and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and  my hometown     those are his links. But nothing really says this model of interactivity    which was so exciting and captures the real  the Web Zeitgeist of         than  Click here for a picture of my dog.  That is    you know  there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that  I think  which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it  and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link. And  you know  I don't want to belittle that. That  in a sense    to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday    that was  in a sense  the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web  that you could put up a link  and somebody could click on it  and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go. But it's still a very one to one kind of relationship. There's one person putting up the link  and there's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not. The new model is much more like this  and we've already seen a couple of references to this. This is what happens when you search  Steven Johnson  on Google. About two months ago  I had the great breakthrough    one of my great  kind of shining achievements    which is that my website finally became a top result for  Steven Johnson.  There's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson who has dropped two spots  I'm happy to say. And  you know  I mean  I'll look at a couple of things like this  but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing. It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze. Because effectively  what's happening here  what's creating this page  obviously    and we all know this  but it's worth just thinking about it    is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson  but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it  and Google just sitting there and running the numbers. So there's this collective decision making that's going on. This page is effectively  collectively authored by the Web  and Google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place. Now  they're more innovative    well  Google's pretty innovative    but there are some new twists on this. There's this incredibly interesting new site    Technorati    that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these. And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs. He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking. And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs  and so you have kind of an authority    a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it. And so at any given time  on any given page on the Web  actually  you can say  what does the weblog community think about this page  And you can get a list. This is what they think about my site  it's ranked by blog authority. You can also rank it by the latest posts. So when I was talking in  Emergence   I talked about the limitations of the one way linking architecture that  basically  you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them. And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two way linking  you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things. Well  something like Technorati is supplying that. Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger  where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web    there's nothing artificial. He has this line where he says  you know  you're going to put up a link there  if you see a link  somebody decided to put it there. And he says  the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page  like a tree fungus.  And in fact  I think that's not entirely true anymore. I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati on the right hand side of my page  and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes. That little list there would change. I wouldn't really be directly in control of it. So it's much closer  in a way  to a data fungus  in a sense  wrapped around that page  than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there. Now  what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking. And there are all these interesting tools. Google does the Google Zeitgeist  which looks at search requests to test what's going on  what people are interested in  and they publish it with lots of fun graphs. And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google  so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing. There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist  which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for Britney Spears pictures  which is not necessarily news. The Columbia blows up  suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia. Well  you know  we should expect to see that. That's not necessarily something we didn't know already. So the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain  that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream    the question is  are you finding out something new  And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share which is basically  you take an abstract term  and you search Google for that term  and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name. So basically  the number of pages that mention this term  that also mention this page  the percentage of those pages is that person's Google Share of that term. So you can do kind of interesting contests. Like for instance  this is a Google Share of the TED Conference. So Richard Saul Wurman has about a    percent Google Share of the TED conference. Our good friend Chris has about a six percent    but with a bullet  I might add. But the interesting thing is  you can broaden the search a little bit. And it turns out  actually  that    percent is the Mola mola fish. I had no idea. No  that's not true. I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish. I also did    and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel    but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection. So right here    now this is a big category  you have smaller percentages  so this is  .  percent    Dan Dennett  who'll be speaking shortly. Right below him   .  percent  Steven Pinker. So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there. But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there. So Gary Bauer is not too far behind    has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection. And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So    you can see we're in the ascot  which is always good. And by the way  Chris  that would've been a really good panel  I think  right there. Hubbard apparently started to reach  but besides that  I think it would be good next year. Another quick thing    this is a slightly different thing  but this analysis some of you may have seen. It just came out. This is bursty words  looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses. So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere  so they're kind of  you know  memes that start taking off  that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before. So the first one is    these are the bursty words around     s    slaves  emancipation  slavery  rebellion  Kansas. That's Britney Spears. I mean  you know  OK  interesting. They're talking about slavery in     .         relief  depression  recovery banks. And OK  I didn't learn anything new there as well    that's pretty obvious.       right at the center of the Reagan years    that's  we're  there's  we've  it's. Now  there's one way to interpret this  which is to say that  emancipation  and  depression  and  recovery  all have a lot of syllables. So you know  you can actually download    it's hard to remember those. But seriously  actually  what you can see there  in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise  is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more intimate  much more folksy  much more telegenic    contracting all those verbs. You know     years before it was still   Ask not what you can do   but with Reagan  it's   that's where  there's Nancy and I   that kind of language. And so something we kind of knew  but you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing. I'll go very quickly. The question now    and this is the really interesting question    is  what kind of higher level shape is emerging right now in the overall Web ecosystem    and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge. And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system. Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago  and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs. It follows a power law  so that there are a few extremely well linked to  popular blogs  and a long tail of blogs with very few links. So    percent of the blogs get    percent of the links. Now this is a very interesting thing. It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man  one modem democracy  where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard. And so the question is   Why is this happening   It's not being imposed by fiat from above. It's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now. Now  what's great about it is that people are working on    within seconds of Clay publishing this piece  people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing. And basically  the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first mover advantage. if you're the first site there  everybody links to you. If you're the second site there  most people link to you. And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links  and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future  and then you get this kind of shape. And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on  literally as Shirky started    after he published his piece    was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers. And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links  that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last    hours. So in a sense  bursty weblogs coming from new voices. So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system. And it creates a kind of planned emergence. You're not totally in control  but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices. So the most amazing thing about this    and I'll end on this note    is  most emergent systems  most self organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not. So the most wonderful thing  I think  about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation. I hope it continues here. Thanks a lot. Whoa  dude. Check out those killer equations. Sweet.  Laughter  Actually  for the next    minutes I'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations. It turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral. Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal. Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps. These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors. If we imagine this to be a hyper intelligent coral  we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question. We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors    if it was just chance  or destiny  or what  Now  after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high  he would tell us that our question was completely stupid. These corals can be quite kind of mean  you see  and I have surfing scars to prove that. But this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him. That he was in all these other locations as well  but experiencing them as separate individuals. For a coral  branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world. Unlike us  a hyper intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics. The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works. And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities  just like a coral. It's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around  since we only ever get to experience one possibility. This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schr dinger and his cat. The cat likes this version better. In this setup  Schr dinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that  by the laws of quantum mechanics  branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not. In the branch in which the sample radiates  it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schr dinger is dead. But in the other branch of reality  he remains alive. These realities are experienced separately by each individual. As far as either can tell  the other one doesn't exist. This seems weird to us  because each of us only experiences an individual existence  and we don't get to see other branches. It's as if each of us  like Schr dinger here  are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities. The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales. It can be summed up in a single sentence  Everything that can happen  does. That's quantum mechanics. But this does not mean everything happens. The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't. What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles. And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced. Now I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles  what they are and how this balance works. In this machine  a beam of protons and anti protons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision  producing a burst of pure energy. This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles  with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties. This enormous machine    the large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva    has a circumference of    miles and  when it's operating  draws five times as much power as the city of Monterey. We can't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision. Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized. But physics does tell us what particles can be produced. These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti proton. Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced  and remain invisible to us. This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting. It's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before  so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon. But before talking about what we might see  let me describe the particles we already know of. There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles. Most of us are familiar with electrons. A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around. But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino  with no electric charge and a very tiny mass. In contrast  the up and down quarks have very large masses  and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms. All of these matter particles come in left  and right handed varieties  and have anti particle partners that carry opposite charges. These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations  which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses. These matter particles all interact with the various force particles. The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons. There is also a very weak force called  rather unimaginatively  the weak force  that interacts only with left handed matter. The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge  called color charge  and come in three different varieties  red  green and blue. You can blame Murray Gell Mann for these names    they're his fault. Finally  there's the force of gravity  which interacts with matter via its mass and spin. The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces. These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has. A particle that hasn't been seen yet  but we're pretty sure exists  is the Higgs particle  which gives masses to all these other particles. The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to see this Higgs particle  and we're almost certain it will. But the greatest mystery is what else we might see. And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk. Now  if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges  there are    . That's a lot of particles to keep track of. And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles. But if we plot them out according to their charges  some beautiful patterns emerge. The most familiar charge is electric charge. Electrons have an electric charge  a negative one  and quarks have electric charges in thirds. So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton  it has a total electric charge of plus one. These particles also have anti particles  which have opposite charges. Now  it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges  hypercharge and weak charge. If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two dimensional charge space  the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction. The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge  which make this pattern. This is called the Unified Electroweak Model  and it was put together back in     . The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle. The Higgs  over here on the left  has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern. It makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass. Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram  the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space. So the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two dimensional space. We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions. The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four dimensional charge space  and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them. Whenever particles interact  nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions. If a particle and an anti particle collide  it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions. At this point  anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero. For example  this weak force particle and its anti particle can be created in a collision. In further interactions  the charges must always balance. One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti neutrino  and these three still add to zero total charge. Nature always keeps a perfect balance. So these patterns of charges are not just pretty. They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen. And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction  which has this nice hexagonal symmetry. In a strong interaction  a strong force particle  such as this one  interacts with a colored quark  such as this green one  to give a quark with a different color charge    this red one. And strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies  holding the atomic nuclei together. But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story. We can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force. When we include these  each matter particle has two different spin charges  spin up and spin down. So they all split  and give a nice pattern in six dimensional charge space. We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions  and see that it's quite pretty. Right now  this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles. This is what we know for certain. Some of these particles are at the very limit of what we've been able to reach with experiments. From this pattern  we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales. The way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful. But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don't know yet. We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone  and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada. We want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe. And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies. So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges  which is not very symmetric  could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken    similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism. In order to do this  we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions. When we introduce a new direction  we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction  and then we can rotate it in with the others. If we guess wisely  we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions. This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in     . When we look at this new unified pattern  we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing. This is the way theories of unification work. A physicist looks for larger  more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset. The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen. This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles  which should act a lot like the weak force  only weaker. Now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles  the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six dimensional charge space as the first generation. These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges. They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space. However  if we work in eight dimensional charge space  then we can assign unique new charges to each particle. Then we can spin these in eight dimensions  and see what the whole pattern looks like. Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called  triality.  This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics. It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group  E . This Lie group is a smooth  curved shape with     dimensions. Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape. One small part of this E  shape can be used to describe the curved space time of Einstein's general relativity  explaining gravity. Together with quantum mechanics  the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales. The pattern of this shape living in eight dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful  and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles  each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape. As we spin it  we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one. And with a particular rotation  we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once. It's a very beautiful object  and as with any unification  we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern. There are    gaps where new particles should be  two of which have been filled by the Pati Salam particles. From their location in this pattern  we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle  but have color charge and interact with the strong force. Filling in these new particles completes this pattern  giving us the full E . This E  pattern has very deep mathematical roots. It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics. It's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable. And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new. In       Galileo wrote this   Nature's grand book  which stands continually open to our gaze  is written in the language of mathematics. Its characters are triangles  circles and other geometrical figures  without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it  without these  one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth.  I believe this to be true  and I've tried to follow Galileo's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles  circles and other geometrical figures. Of course  when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff  the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth. But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure  beautiful geometry. Joined with quantum mechanics  this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E  coral  with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern. And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the Large Hadron Collider  we may be able to see whether nature uses this E  pattern or a different one. This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in. If the LHC finds particles that fit this E  pattern  that will be very  very cool. If the LHC finds new particles  but they don't fit this pattern    well  that will be very interesting  but bad for this E  theory. And  of course  bad for me personally. Now how bad would that be  Well  pretty bad. But predicting how nature works is a very risky game. This theory and others like it are long shots. One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won't end up being true about nature. That's what doing theoretical physics is like  there are a lot of wipeouts. In this regard  new physics theories are a lot like start up companies. As with any large investment  it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out. But in science  if something isn't working  you have to toss it out and try something else. Now  the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life. I've tried the best I can to live a balanced life. I try to balance my life equally between physics  love and surfing    my own three charge directions. This way  even if the physics I work on comes to nothing  I still know I've lived a good life. And I try to live in beautiful places. For most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui  a very beautiful place. Now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full time employment. I'm going to let you in on that secret. This was a view from my home office on Maui. And this is another  and another. And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar  but in slightly different places. That's because this used to be my home and office on Maui. I've chosen a very unusual life. But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what I love. Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times  but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with. It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyper intelligent coral. But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper intelligent people. So I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I probably understood two percent of that  but I still absolutely loved it. So I'm going to sound dumb. Your theory of everything    Garrett Lisi  I'm used to coral. CA  That's right. The reason it's got a few people at least excited is because  if you're right  it brings gravity and quantum theory together. So are you saying that we should think of the universe  at its heart    that the smallest things that there are  are somehow an E  object of possibility  I mean  is there a scale to it  at the smallest scale  or ...  GL  Well  right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics    that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape. And that's the one that I said we knew for certain. And that shape has remarkable similarities    and the way it fits into this E  pattern could be the rest of the picture. And these patterns of points that I've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience. And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see. CA  But a string theorist  as I understand it  explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating    I know you don't like string theory    vibrating inside it. How should we think of an electron in relation to E   GL  No  it would be one of the symmetries of this E  shape. So what's happening is  as the shape is moving over space time  it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see. So it would be    CA  The size of the E  shape  how does that relate to the electron  I kind of feel like I need that for my picture. Is it bigger  Is it smaller  GL  Well  as far as we know electrons are point particles  so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales. So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is  all possibilities are expanding and developing at once. And this is why I use the analogy to coral. And in this way  the way that E  comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space time. And  as I said  the way the shape twists    the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface    is what the elementary particles are  themselves. So through quantum field theory  they manifest themselves as points and interact that way. I don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer. CA  It doesn't really matter. It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder  and I certainly want to understand more of this. But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating. I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design  I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art. But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges  they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way  and transform it so that it can be used by people like us. And so that gives me an opportunity  because every design show that I curate kind of looks at a different world. And it's great  because it seems like every time I change jobs. And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I'm working on  which is called  Design and the Elastic Mind.  The world that I decided to focus on this particular time is the world of science and the world of technology. Technology always comes into play when design is involved  but science does a little less. But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them. And this is what this exhibition looks at. If you think about your life today  you go every day through many different scales  many different changes of rhythm and pace. You work over different time zones  you talk to very different people  you multitask. We all know it  and we do it kind of automatically. Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic  others are a little slower  others have a few stretch marks  but nonetheless this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint. Other people are not as elastic. I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet. He doesn't want to put high speed Internet at home. And that's because there's some little bit of fear  little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms. So designers work on this particular malaise that we have  these kinds of discomforts that we have  and try to make life easier for us. Elasticity of mind is something that we really need  you know  we really need  we really cherish and we really work on. And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic  and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity. And one last thing is that it's not only designers  but it's also scientists. And before I launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview  I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design. You can say that the relationship between science and design goes back centuries. You can of course talk about Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women    and there's a gigantic history behind it. But according to a really great science historian you might know  Peter Galison    he teaches at Harvard    what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest  this real passion for design. So basically  the idea of being able to build things bottom up  atom by atom  has made them all into tinkerers. And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers  just like designers are seeking scientists. It's a brand new love affair that we're trying to cultivate at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly  who is the founder of Seed magazine    that's now a multimedia company  you might know it    we founded about a year ago a monthly salon for designers and scientists  and it's quite beautiful. And Keith has come  and also Jonathan has come and many others. And it was great  because at the beginning was this apology fest    you know  scientists would tell designers  you know  I don't know what style is  I'm not really elegant. And designers would like  oh  I don't know how to do an equation  I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden they really started talking each others' language  and now we're already at the point that they collaborate. Paul Steinhardt  a physicist from New York  and Aranda Lasch  architects  collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine. And it's really interesting to see how this happens. The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists  and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us. I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now  just to give you a taste of it. Nanophysics and nanotechnology  for instance  have really opened the designer's mind. In this case I'm showing more the designers' work  because they're the ones that have really been stimulated. A lot of the objects in the show are concepts  not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here is the work of some scientists from UCLA. This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins    not only by color but literally by alphabet letters. So they construct it  and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor  Tony Dunne  and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future. New sensing elements on the body    you can grow hairs on your nails  and therefore grab some of the particles from another person. They seem very  very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate. So they're working on enhancing everything  touch  smell    everything they can  in order to find the perfect mate. Very interesting. This is a typeface designer from Israel who has designed    he calls them  typosperma.  He's thinking    of course it's all a concept    of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa  I don't know how to say it in English    spermatazoi    in order to make them become    to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation.  Laughter  I tell you  designers are quite fantastic  you know. So  tissue design. In this case too  you have a mixture of scientists and designers. This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts. The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint. One of the assignments for a year was to work with in vitro meat. You know that already you can grow meat in vitro. In Australia they did it    this research company  called SymbioticA. But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty. And so  the assignment to the students was  how should the steak of tomorrow be  When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape  what should it be like  So this particular student  James King  went around the beautiful English countryside  picked the best  best cow that he could see  and then put her in the MRI machine. Then  he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat    of course  this is done with a Japanese resins food maker  but you know  in the future it could be made better    which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find. Instead  this element here is much more banal. Something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue  so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one    literally. So  this is indeed made of human bone tissue. This is SymbioticA  and they've been working    they were the first ones to do this in vitro meat    and now they've also done an in vitro coat  a leather coat. It's miniscule  but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one. So  we'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future. One of the most important topics of the show    you know  as anything in our life today  we can look at it from many  many different viewpoints  and at different levels. One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale. We change scale very often  we change resolution of screens  and we're not really fazed by it  we do it very comfortably. So you go  even in the exhibition  from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data    the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world. In this particular case a section will be devoted to information design. You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is  Human vs. Chimps     the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps. It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine. And here's the whole code of Pac Man  visualized with all the go to  go back to  also made into a beautiful choreography. And then also graphs by scientists  this beautiful diagraph of protein homology. Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics. We were discussing with Keith Shrubb  this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations  otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes. So they pick the worst background from any kind of PowerPoint presentation  the worst typeface. It's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first  pretty     if we can say so    scientific presentations. Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind opening  promising and will really be the future of design  is the idea of collective design. You know  the whole XO laptop  from One Laptop per Child  is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking. So  the more the merrier. The more computers  the stronger the signal  and children work on the interface so that it's all based on doing things together  tasks together. So the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future  and this is chosen as an example. Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectiveness  collectivity is the idea of existence maximum. That's a term that I coined a few years ago while I was thinking of how pressed we are together  and at the same time how these small objects  like the Walkman first and then the iPod  create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space. You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your iPod. And this is the work of several designers that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various techniques. This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa  you have a massage  you have a facial  maybe a rub  and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature  and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time. And same thing here  Social Tele presence. It's actually already used by the military a little bit  but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you're removed from it physically. And this is called Blind Date. It's a  unclear   so if you're too shy to be really at the date  you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you. Rapid manufacturing is another big area in which technology and design are  I think  bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times. Rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine. It used to be called rapid prototyping  rapid modeling. It started out in the '  s  but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very  very fragile  and could not have any real use. Slowly but surely  the materials became better    better resins. Techniques became better    not only carving but also stereolithography and laser    solidifying all kinds of resins  whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger  to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing. It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair  but you know what  One day it will take seven hours. And then the dream is that you'll be able to  from home  customize your chair. You know  companies and designers will be designing the matrix or the margins that respect both solidity and brand  and design identity. And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner and go get your chair. Now  the implications of this are enormous  not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process  but also no tracking  no warehousing  no wasted materials. Also  I can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change. And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine    you know  the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much    that shows you can have your desktop  D printer and print your own basketball. But here instead are examples  you can already  D print textiles  which is very interesting. This is just a really nice touch    it's called slow prototyping. It's a designer that put        bees at work and they built this vase. They had a particular shape that they had to stay in. Mapping and tagging. As the capacity of computers becomes really  really big  and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger  we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path. Also  we do it in order to share with other people. Again  this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today. So  various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays. Also  the senses    designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more. And also animal senses in a way. This particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment    the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense  and so    much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer    bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer  and also pregnancy. And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies  in this case  pregnancy. Another shape is made for cancer. Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves. Some designers don't design objects  products  things that we're going to actually use  but rather  they design scenarios that are object based. They're still very useful. They help companies and other designers think better about the future. And usually they are accompanied by videos. This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby   All the Robots.  Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of. We always think that robots will take care of us  and instead they designed these robots that are very  very needy. You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something. Another one gets really  really nervous if you get in to the room  and starts shaking  so you have to calm it down. So it's really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us. Noam Toran and  Accessories for Lonely Men   the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup  what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person. So he designed all these series of accessories. This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night. Then there's another one that breathes on your neck. There's another one that throws plates and breaks them. So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life. Elio Caccavale  he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia. He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation  and also the spider gene into the goat  from a few years ago. He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today. Because it's not anymore Mom  Dad  the flowers and the bees  and then there's the baby. No  it can be two moms  three dads  in vitro    there's the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed. So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now. One of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on life  even though they take technology into account. And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning  and what we can do about it today with new technologies. Or how we should behave about it with new technologies. These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very  very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away. So instead of having only the pictures  you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have  you know  Gertrude's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive. And this is even better. This is Auger Loizeau   AfterLife.  It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife. So to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death  they take the gastric juices of people who passed away and concentrate them  and put them into a battery that can actually be used to power flashlights. They also go    you know  sex toys  whatever. It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile  can make you laugh  can make you cry sometimes. But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going    which is always  hopefully  a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going. Thank you very much. You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses  and one answer to that is  because I'm here to talk about glamour. So  we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is. It's glamorous movie stars  like Marlene Dietrich. And it comes in a male form  too    very glamorous. Not only can he shoot  drive  drink    you know  he drinks wine  there actually is a little wine in there    and of course  always wears a tuxedo. But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning    one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters  but also comes in other forms. A magazine  Well  it's certainly not this one. This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand    it's all about sex tips. Sex tips are not glamorous. And Drew Barrymore  for all her wonderful charm  is not glamorous either. But there is a glamour of industry. This is Margaret Bourke White's    one of her pictures she did. Fantastic  glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places. And there's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur. This is the Hewlett Packard garage. We know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding Hewlett Packard. There's the glamour of physics. What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe  grand unification  And  by the way  it helps if you're Brian Greene    he has other kinds of glamour. And there is  of course  this glamour. This is very  very glamorous  the glamour of outer space    and not the alien style glamour  but the nice  clean  early '  s version. So what do we mean by glamour  Well  one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary. And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary  in this case the      dictionary. Because for centuries  glamour had a very particular meaning  and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it. You had  a  glamour. It wasn't glamour as a quality    you  cast a glamour.  Glamour was a literal magic spell. Not a metaphorical one  the way we use it today  but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent  Celtic magic. And over the years  around the turn of the   th century  it started to take on this other kind of deception    this definition for any artificial interest in  or association with  an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified. But still  glamour is an illusion. Glamour is a magic spell. And there's something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell on you  it was not in your self interest    it was to get you to act against your interest. Well of course  in the   th century  glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood. And this is Hedy Lamarr. Hedy Lamarr said   Anyone can look glamorous  all you have to do is sit there and look stupid.   Laughter  But in fact  with all due respect to Hedy    about whom we'll hear more later    there's a lot more to it. There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this Hollywood glamour. There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make up experts. You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up. So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth    it was a portrait of a star. And actually  we see glamorized photos of stars all the time    they call them false color. Glamour is a form of falsification  but falsification to achieve a particular purpose. It may be to illuminate the star  it may be to sell a film. And it involves a great deal of technique. It's not    glamour is not something    you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are. Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous. There is a process of  idealization  glorification and dramatization   and it's not just the case for people. Glamour doesn't have to be people. Architectural photography    Julius Schulman  who has talked about transfiguration  took this fabulous  famous picture of the Kauffman House. Architectural photography is extremely glamorous. It puts you into this special  special world. This is Alex Ross's comic book art  which appears to be extremely realistic  as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art. Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world. When you stack people in rows  the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground    but not in the world of glamour. What glamour is all about    I took this from a blurb in the table of contents of New York magazine  which was telling us that glamour is back    glamour is all about transcending the everyday. And I think that that's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is. This is Filippino Lippi's      portrait of Saint Apollonia. And I don't know who she is either  but this is the    th  century equivalent of a supermodel. It's a very glamorous portrait. Why is it glamorous  It's glamorous  first  because she is beautiful    but that does not make you glamorous  that only makes you beautiful. She is graceful  she is mysterious and she is transcendent  and those are the central qualities of glamour. You don't see her eyes  they're looking downward. She's not looking away from you exactly  but you have to mentally imagine her world. She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs  where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture. Mel Gibson's  Passion Of The Christ     not glamorous. That's glamour  that's Michelangelo's  Pieta   where Mary is the same age as Jesus and they're both awfully happy and pleasant. Glamour invites us to live in a different world. It has to simultaneously be mysterious  a little bit distant    that's why  often in these glamour shots  the person is not looking at the audience  it's why sunglasses are glamorous    but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person. In some sense  there has to be something like us. So as I say  in religious art  you know  God is not glamorous. God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent  omniscient    too far above us. And yet you will see in religious art  saints or the Virgin Mary will often be portrayed    not always    in glamorous forms. As I said earlier  glamour does not have to be about people  but it has to have this transcendent quality. What is it about Superman  Aside from Alex Ross's style  which is very glamorous  one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly. Glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized  perfect place. And this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous. The less experience we have with them  the more glamorous they are. So you can do a glamorized picture of a car  but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic. You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane  but not the inside. The notion is that it's going to transport you  and the story is not about  you know  the guy in front of you in the airplane  who has this nasty little kid  or the big cough. The story is about where you're arriving  or thinking about where you're arriving. And this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling. This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period  but because  in it's streamlining  it transports us from the everyday. The same thing    arches are very glamorous. Arches with stained glass    even more glamorous. Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous. I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because  to me  it captures the whole promise of the academic contemplative life    but maybe that's because I went to Princeton. Anyway  skylines are super glamorous  city streets    not so glamorous. You know  when you get  actually to this town it has reality. The horizon  the open road  is very  very glamorous. There are few things more glamorous than the horizon    except  possibly  multiple horizons. Of course  here you don't feel the cold  or the heat    you just see the possibilities. In order to pull glamour off  you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura  which is a term coined by Castiglione in his book   The Book Of The Courtier.  There's the not glamorous version of what it looks like today  after a few centuries. And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art. It makes things look effortless. You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress    she just looks completely natural. And I remember reading  after the Lara Croft movies  how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue. Of course  they covered that with make up  because Lara Croft did all those same stunts    but she doesn't get black and blue  because she has sprezzatura.  To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort   And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour. Glamour is about editing. How do you create the sense of transcendence  the sense of evoking a perfect world  The sense of  you know  life could be better  I could join this    I could be a perfect person  I could join this perfect world. We don't tell you all the grubby details. Now  this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos  from last year. This is underneath Jeff's desk. This is what the real world of computers  lamps  electrical appliances of all kinds  looks like. But if you look in a catalog    particularly a catalog of modern  beautiful objects for your home    it looks like this. There are no cords. Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail    you can usually figure out where they hid the cord. But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp  you will live in a world without cords.  Laughter  And the same thing is true of  if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer    and even in these wireless eras  you don't get to live in the world without cords. You have to have mystery and you have to have grace. And there she is    Grace. This is the most glamorous picture  I think  ever. Part of the thing is that  in  Rear Window   the question is  is she too glamorous to live in his world  And the answer is no  but of course it's really just a movie. Here's Hedy Lamarr again. And  you know  this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because  like sunglasses  it conceals and reveals at the same time. Translucence is glamorous    that's why all these people wear pearls. It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent    not transparent  not opaque. It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture. And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person  maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot  because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous. It has that sense of going up and away  and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were    particularly going down. And of course glass block has that sense of translucence. So  this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning. All individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized in reality. They have contradictions  they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other    whatever it is    and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals. And the way we deal with that is we displace them    we put them into a golden world  an imagined world  an age of heroes  the world to come. And in the life of an individual  we often associate that with some object. The white picket fence  the perfect house. The perfect kitchen    no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen. You know  you buy that Viking range  this is what your kitchen will look like. The perfect love life    symbolized by the perfect necklace  the perfect diamond ring. The perfect getaway in your perfect car. This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia. The perfect office    again  no cords  as far as I can tell. And certainly  no  it doesn't look a thing like my office. I mean  there's no paper on the desk. We want this golden world. And some people get rich enough  and if they have their ideals    in a sort of domestic sense  they get to acquire their perfect world. Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater  which is    I don't think accidentally    in Art Deco style. That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home. This is not always good  because what is your perfect world  What is your ideal  and also  what has been edited out  Is it something important   The Matrix  is a movie that is all about glamour. I could do a whole talk on  The Matrix  and glamour. It was criticized for glamorizing violence  because  look    sunglasses and those long coats  and  of course  they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world. This is another Margaret Bourke White photo. This is from Soviet Union. Attractive. I mean  look how happy the people are  and good looking too. You know  we're marching toward Utopia. I'm not a fan of PETA  but I think this is a great ad. Because what they're doing is they're saying  your coat's not so glamorous  what's been edited out is something important. But actually  what's even more important than remembering what's been edited out is thinking  are the ideals good  Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive. And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor. This is from  Triumph Of The Will     brilliant editing to cut together things. There's a glamour shot. National Socialism is all about glamour. It was a very aesthetic ideology. It was all about cleaning up Germany  and the West  and the world  and ridding it of anything unglamorous. So glamour can be dangerous. I think glamour has a genuine appeal  has a genuine value. I'm not against glamour. But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life. And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it. And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice and confront the manipulation of it all  and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy  but also enjoy how it happens. And here's Hedy Lamarr. She's very glamorous but  you know  she invented spread spectrum technology. So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid  even though she thought she could look stupid. David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash  which only took a fraction of a second to happen. There is a book out in the bookstore    it's called  Symphony In Steel   and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center. And that has a fascination. It's not necessarily glamorous  but unveiling the glamour has an appeal. There's a wonderful book called  Crowns  that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats. And there's a quote from one of these women  and she talks about   As a little girl  I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats. They looked like beautiful dolls  like they'd just stepped out of a magazine. But I also knew how hard they worked all week. Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow.  And  actually  you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it. Thank you. This session is on natural wonders  and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness. I want to try to combine them all  because to me  healing is really the ultimate natural wonder. Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself  and much more quickly than people had once realized  if you simply stop doing what s causing the problem. And so  really  so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet. I love doing this work  because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn t have before  and it allows us to talk about things that    not just diet  but that happiness is not    we're talking about the pursuit of happiness  but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions  what Aldous Huxley called the  perennial wisdom   when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people  it s really about    our nature is to be happy  our nature is to be peaceful  our nature is to be healthy. And so it s not something    happiness is not something you get  health is generally not something that you get. But rather all of these different practices    you know  the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn t develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure  unclog your arteries  even though it can do all those things. They re powerful tools for transformation  for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy  to be peaceful  to be joyful and to realize that it s not something that you pursue and get  but rather it s something that you have already until you disturb it. I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda and people would say   What are you  a Hindu   He d say   No  I m an undo.  And it s really about identifying what s causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness  and then to allow that natural healing to occur. To me  that s the real natural wonder. So  within that larger context  we can talk about diet  stress management    which are really these spiritual practices    moderate exercise  smoking cessation  support groups and community    which I ll talk more about    and some vitamins and supplements. And it s not a diet. You know  when most people think about the diet I recommend  they think it s a really strict diet. For reversing disease  that s what it takes  but if you re just trying to be healthy  you have a spectrum of choices. And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction  you re going to live longer  you re going to feel better  you re going to lose weight  and so on. And in our studies  what we ve been able to do is to use very expensive  high tech  state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost    and in many ways  ancient    interventions  can be. We first began by looking at heart disease  and when I began doing this work    or    years ago  it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse. And what we found was that  instead of getting worse and worse  in many cases it could get better and better  and much more quickly than people had once realized. This is a representative patient who at the time was       totally needed to have a bypass  decided to do this instead. We used quantitative arteriography  showing the narrowing. This is one of the arteries that feed the heart  one of the main arteries  and you can see the narrowing here. A year later  it s not as clogged  normally  it goes the other direction. These minor changes in blockages caused a     percent improvement in blood flow  and using cardiac positron emission tomography  or  PET   scans  blue and black is no blood flow  orange and white is maximal. Huge differences can occur without drugs  without surgery. Clinically  he literally couldn t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain  within a month  like most people  was pain free  and within a year  climbing more than     floors a day on a Stairmaster. This is not unusual  and it s part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes  because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life. Overall  if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients  they got worse and worse  from one year to five years  in the comparison group. This is the natural history of heart disease  but it s really not natural because we found it could get better and better  and much more quickly than people had once thought. We also found that the more people change  the better they got. It wasn t a function of how old or how sick they were    it was mainly how much they changed  and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones. I got this as a Christmas card a few years ago from two of the patients in one of our programs. The younger brother is     the older one s     they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were. And the following year they sent me this one  which I thought was kind of funny. You just never know. And what we found was that    percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease. Now I thought  you know  if we just did good science  that would change medical practice. But  that was a little naive. It s important  but not enough. Because we doctors do what we get paid to do  and we get trained to do what we get paid to do  so if we change insurance  then we change medical practice and medical education. Insurance will cover the bypass  it ll cover the angioplasty  it won t  until recently  cover diet and lifestyle. So  we began through our nonprofit institute's training hospitals around the country  and we found that most people could avoid surgery  and not only was it medically effective  it was also cost effective. And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost        dollars per patient  and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they re paying for       people to go through the program on the sites that we train. The fortuneteller says   I give smokers a discount because there s not as much to tell.   Laughter  I like this slide  because it s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change  and what doesn t. And what doesn t work is fear of dying  and that s what s normally used. Everybody who smokes knows it s not good for you  and still    percent of Americans smoke       percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it  Well  because it helps them get through the day. And I ll talk more about this  but the real epidemic isn t just heart disease or obesity or smoking    it s loneliness and depression. As one woman said   I ve got    friends in this package of cigarettes  and they re always there for me and nobody else is. You re going to take away my    friends  What are you going to give me   Or they eat when they get depressed  or they use alcohol to numb the pain  or they work too hard  or watch too much TV. There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain  but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem. And the pain is not the problem  it s the symptom. And telling people they re going to die is too scary to think about  or  they re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary  and so they don t want to think about it  so they don t. The most effective anti smoking ad was this one. You ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth  and  impotence     the headline is   Impotent     it s not emphysema. What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago  Viagra  right  Why  Because a lot of guys need it. It s not like you say   Hey Joe  I m having erectile dysfunction  how about you   And yet  look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold. It s not so much psychological  it s vascular  and nicotine makes your arteries constrict. So does cocaine  so does a high fat diet  so does emotional stress. So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired  lethargic  depressed and impotent  and that s not much fun. But when you change those behaviors  your brain gets more blood  you think more clearly  you have more energy  your heart gets more blood in ways I ve shown you. Your sexual function improves. And these things occur within hours. This is a study  a high fat meal  and within one or two hours blood flow is measurably less    and you ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving. When you eat a big fatty meal  how do you feel  You feel kind of sleepy afterwards. On a low fat meal  the blood flow doesn t go down    it even goes up. Many of you have kids  and you know that s a big change in your lifestyle  and so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they re worth it. And the paradox is that when you make big changes  you get big benefits  and you feel so much better so quickly. For many people  those are choices worth making    not to live longer  but to live better. I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic  because it really is a problem. Two thirds of adults are overweight or obese  and diabetes in kids and    year olds has increased    percent in the last    years. It s no joke  it s real. And just to show you this  this is from the CDC. These are not election returns  these are the percentage of people who are overweight. And if you see from '   to '   to '    '    '    '    '      you get a new category     to    percent  '    '    '    '    '    '      you get a new category  '    '          and     . Mississippi  more than    percent of people are overweight. Why is this  Well  this is one way to lose weight that works very well ... but it doesn t last  which is the problem. Now  there s no mystery in how you lose weight  you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories. Now  one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food  which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food  or if you restrict entire categories of foods. But the problem is  you get hungry  so it s hard to keep it off. The other way is to change the type of food. And fat has nine calories per gram  whereas protein and carbs only have four. So  when you eat less fat  you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food. So you can eat the same amount of food  but you ll be getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories. And it s the volume of food that affects satiety  rather than the type of food. You know  I don t like talking about the Atkins diet  but I get asked about it every day  and so I just thought I d spend a few minutes on that. The myth that you hear about is  Americans have been told to eat less fat  the percent of calories from fat is down  Americans are fatter than ever  therefore fat doesn t make you fat. It s a half truth. Actually  Americans are eating more fat than ever  and even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower  the actual amount is higher  and so the goal is to reduce both. Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died  and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs  the  bad carbs   and these are things like       sugar  white flour  white rice  alcohol. And you get a double whammy  you get all these calories that don t fill you up because you ve removed the fiber  and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up. Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down  which is good. But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat. So  the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages    these are not health foods    but to go from  bad carbs  to what are called  good carbs.  And these are things like whole foods  or unrefined carbs  fruits  vegetables  whole wheat flour  brown rice  in their natural forms  are rich in fiber. And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories  and it slows the absorption so you don t get that rapid rise in blood sugar. So  and you get all the disease protective substances. It s not just what you exclude from your diet  but also what you include that s protective. Just as all carbs are not bad for you  all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats. And these are predominantly what are called the Omega   fatty acids. You find these  for example  in fish oil. And the bad fats are things like trans fatty acids and processed food and saturated fats  which we find in meat. If you don t remember anything else from this talk  three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by    to    percent. Three grams a day. They come in one gram capsules  more than that just gives you extra fat you don t need. It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast  prostate and colon cancer. Now  the problem with the Atkins diet  everybody knows people who have lost weight on it  but you can lose weight on amphetamines  you know  and fen phen. I mean  there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren t good for you. You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it. And the problem is that it s based on this half truth  which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs  so if you eat fewer simple carbs you re going to lose weight. You ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat  and you ll enhance your health rather than harming it. He says   I ve got some good news. While your cholesterol level has remained the same  the research findings have changed.  Now  what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet  The red is good at the beginning  and a year later    this is from a study done in a peer reviewed journal called Angiology    there s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend  there s less red  less blood flow after a year on an Atkins type diet. So  yes  you can lose weight  but your heart isn t happy. Now  one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center found that    percent of the people were constipated     percent had bad breath     percent had headaches   this is not a healthy way to eat. And so  you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you  but when they get too close it s going to be a problem. And more seriously  there are case reports now of    year old girls who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet    of bone disease  kidney disease  and so on. And that s how your body excretes waste  is through your breath  your bowels and your perspiration. So when you go on these kinds of diet  they begin to smell bad. So  an optimal diet is low in fat  low in the bad carbs  high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats. And then  again  it s a spectrum  when you move in this direction  you re going to lose weight  you re going to feel better and you re going to gain health. Now  there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too  whether it s the deforestation of the Amazon  or making more protein available  to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day    not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have. So  there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health. Now  we re about to publish the first study looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer  and  in collaboration with Sloane Kettering and with UCSF. We took    men who had biopsy proven prostate cancer and who had elected  for reasons unrelated to the study  not to have surgery. We could randomly divide them into two groups  and then we could have one group that is a non intervention control group to compare to  which we can t do with  say  breast cancer  because everyone gets treated. What we found was that  after a year  none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment  whereas six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation. When we looked at their PSA levels    which is a marker for prostate cancer    they got worse in the control group  but they actually got better in the experimental group  and these differences were highly significant. And then I wondered  was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle    whichever group they were in    and the changes in PSA  And sure enough  we found a dose response relationship  just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies. And in order for the PSA to go down  they had to make pretty big changes. I then wondered  well  maybe they re just changing their PSA  but it s not really affecting the tumor growth. So we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA  they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture  and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group       versus   percent. And finally  I said  I wonder if there s any relationship between how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth  whichever group they happened to be in. And this really got me excited because again  we found the same pattern  the more people change  the more it affected the growth of their tumors. And finally  we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients  and the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient  and you can see clearly it s better a year later  along with the PSA going down. So  if it s true for prostate cancer  it ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well. And whether or not you have conventional treatment  in addition  if you make these changes  it may help reduce the risk of recurrence. The last thing I want to talk about  apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness  is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed    and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture    are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely  in part because  as we talked about  they re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on. But also  through mechanisms that we don t fully understand  people who are lonely and depressed are many times    three to five to ten times  in some studies    more likely to get sick and die prematurely. And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that. Now  on the other hand  anything that promotes intimacy is healing. It can be sexual intimacy   I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing. Friendship  altruism  compassion  service   all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures    once you stop trying to see the differences  these are the things in our own self interest  because they free us from our suffering and from disease. And it s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do. Just take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford. He took women with metastatic breast cancer  randomly divided them into two groups. One group of people just met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group. It was a nurturing  loving environment  where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood  because they were going through it too. They just met once a week for a year. Five years later  those women lived twice as long  and you can see that the people    and that was the only difference between the groups. It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet. Other studies have shown this as well. So  these simple things that create intimacy are really healing  and even the word healing  it comes from the root  to make whole.  The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit  meaning  union  to yoke  to bring together.  And the last slide I want to show you is from    I was    again  this swami that I studied with for so many years  and I did a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds at the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago. And at the end of it  somebody said   Hey  Swami  what s the difference between wellness and illness   And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word  illness   and circled the first letter  and then wrote the word  wellness   and circled the first two letters ... To me  it s just shorthand for what we re talking about  that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing. And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process. Thank you.  Applause  You all know this story. In the summer of       Enrico Fermi  the Italian American physicist and atomic pile builder  went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there  and asked them a question   Where is everybody   This confused his colleagues  obviously  because they were sitting right there with him. And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them. He was talking about the space aliens. You see  this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell  New Mexico. And even though that turned out to be nothing  nothing at all    merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths ... Still  America had gone saucer mad  even famous scientists who were eating lunch. Fermi's reasoning  if I may paraphrase badly  is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason  there should be other intelligent life out there. And the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve  we should have some evidence of their existence by now. And yet  to the best of our knowledge  we are alone.  Where is everybody   asked Fermi  and his colleagues had no answer. Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies  Sasquatch  God  the possibility of love    and thereafter  as you know  Enrico Fermi ate alone. Now  I am not a scientist. I have never built an atomic pile. Although  I might argue that  technically  every pile is atomic. However  with respect  I might point out two possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider. One is that the aliens might be very far away. Perhaps  I dare say  even on other planets. The other possibility    is  perhaps  Enrico Fermi himself was an alien. Think about it. Isn't it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War  out of nowhere  suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after  And isn't it a little strange that he required no payment for this  That he asked for only one thing    a gift of two healthy sperm whales  That's    that's not true. But it is strange. And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien  wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here  For it is given in certain UFO ology or UFOlogy circles  that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia  that they have walked among us in disguise  observing us  guiding our evolution from ape to man    if you believe in that sort of thing    and  occasionally  kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids. It's a difficult theory to discount  I think you'll agree. For even in my own life  there are memories I have that are difficult to explain    happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird  that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life. For how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that I had and will describe to you now  Encounter one  Ocean City  New Jersey      . This was the summer when the special edition of  Close Encounters of the Third Kind  was released. And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore. Within    hours  I was horribly sunburned  just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie. And so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night  the sidewalk still warm from the sun  watching the skies for UFOs. What did I see  Stars  satellites  blinking airplanes    typical sky junk. Occasionally  kids would come and join me and watch  but their necks soon got sore  and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans. I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part  so I stayed alone with the cosmos. And that's when it happened. An elderly couple came walking down the street. I would say they were in their late seventies  and I would say that they were on a date  because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie    a brown suit. And she was wearing a cardigan  because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean. I remember  for some reason  that they were exactly the same height. And then they stopped  and the man turned to me and said   What are you looking for  flying saucers   You have to admit  that's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date. But what was stranger still    and even I realized it at the time  as a nine year old child    was that they stopped at all. That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child.  Oh   he said   little green men.  And then his girlfriend joined in  too.  There's no such thing as space men   she said.  There's no such thing.  And then they both laughed.  Ha  ha  ha.  I looked around. The street was entirely empty. I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean. It was as though time had stopped. I did not know why they were teasing me. I looked into their strangely angry faces  and I remember wondering  are they wearing rubber masks  And what would be behind those rubber masks  if they were  Giant  almond shaped  unblinking eyes  Slits for mouths  The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun  and then he made laser sounds.  Kew  kew  kew    watch out.  And they turned at once and walked away. The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand  and found it  and left me alone. Now  you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding    a strange encounter among humans. Maybe it was swamp gas  but    I know what I saw. Close encounter two  Brookline  Massachusetts      . I went to see the movie  Dune   and a girl talked to me. Now  on its face    this is impossible on its face  I realize    but it is absolutely true. It was opening night  naturally. I went with my friend Tim McGonigal  who sat on my left. On my right was the girl in question. She had long  curly black hair  a blue jean jacket. I remember  she had some sort of injury to her ankle  an Ace bandage  and she had crutches. She was very tall  I would say. I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior  but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school. I didn't know her name  and I never will. She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother  and they were talking about the novel   Dune.  They were both big fans  mother and daughter    very unusual. They were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms. And then it got stranger. That's when she turned to me and said   Are you looking forward to seeing the movie   First of all  I was embarrassed because I had not read the novel  Dune  at that time. I was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets  as I still am. But it was also the tone of how she asked the question  apropos of nothing  like she didn't even care about the answer  as though she just wanted to talk to me. I did not know what to say. I said   Yes.  I did not even turn my head. The movie began. I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of  Dune   in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time. There was a character called the Third Stage Guild Navigator  which was a kind of giant  floating fetus creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him  allowing him to bend space and time. He could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world. He had become  in his isolation  so deformed and so sexy  that he had to talk through a kind of old timey radio to the outside world  and could never touch them. I mean  I liked him a lot better than the sandworms. The sandworms were fine  but your favorite character  Please. When the movie ended  everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible. Except for the girl. As I walked out  her pace slowed. Perhaps it was the crutches  but it seemed    it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again. When I say it out loud  it sounds so ridiculous  but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what  in the alien abductee community  they call a  screen memory   a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma    say  of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid. And so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her. I sure am glad I never saw her again. Close encounter three  Philadelphia  Pennsylvania      . In the mid to late '  s  the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called  Communion   in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens. And he also described the phenomenon known in this community as  lost time   where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes  or the previous ten hours  or the previous ten days. And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes. This book became  naturally  an enormous best seller. This image by Ted Joseph was from that book  and was his  sort of  police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him. And it was so successful that they made it into a movie. And in       the way I remember it  I was in Philadelphia visiting my girlfriend  and we decided  apropos of nothing  to go see this movie. And the way I remember it  the movie featured these details. One  Whitley Strieber was played by Christopher Walken. Two  the alien was played by a rubber puppet. Three  there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe. Four  this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City  Philadelphia. Five  all of which is to say  they made a movie out of the book   Communion   and it starred Christopher Walken. Does something seem strange about this to you  Something odd  Something off  Something wrong with this picture  Think about it. Yes. The answer is  I had a girlfriend. What  How did this happen  When did this happen  I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact  as we walked hand in hand  and pondering these very same questions. And to this day  I have no answer for you. Close encounter four  the Algarve  Portugal      . Some years later  I and this woman    we'll call her  Catherine Fletcher     went traveling through the south of Portugal together. We stayed in old  crumbling  walled cities  in tiny little hotels  and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers. What  Did we do this  Really  Does anyone do this  We went to some topless beaches. Excuse me  No  not in my life. For what it's worth  we went to Sagres  which was considered  at the time  to be the end of the world. And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock  and the lead dog bit me on the ass  requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot. Make of that what you will. Our last day in Portugal  we were in the district capital of Faro  and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time. Now  Faro is a bustling little city  and to get to the beach  she explained  you would have to take a bus and then a boat. And did I want to come with  But I was exhausted and dog bitten  and so I said   No.  I remember what she looked like before she left. The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders  clustering into a kind of a tan. A tan  we were both tan    is this true  Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue  as a result. She was smiling. She was a single woman about to go alone into a country  not even speaking the language  to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen. I loved her  and then she went out into that strange  alien land. It took me some time to come to my senses. I had my own  lost time  moment  where I woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day  almost dinnertime  and she had not come back. Nervous  I went down to the street to look for her. Now  I did not speak Portuguese. I did not know where the beach was. I could not call her on a cell phone because this was       and the aliens had not given us that technology yet. I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes  either Catherine would come back to the hotel  or she would never come back to the hotel. And so I sat down to wait. I did not watch the skies  but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along. And I watched those constellations shift  hoping that they would part and I would see her face. It was at that moment  in that very small town of        or so  that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it. And that's when the Liberians came along. Five young men    all laughing  happy  traveling together  coming back to this hotel where they were staying. One of them was named Joseph  and he asked me what was I doing  and I explained. And he said   Don't worry.  He was sure that Catherine would be safe. But he did not seem so very sure  for he sat down to wait with me. And for the next two hours  they all waited with me  taking turns  going up to their room  coming back  telling me jokes  distracting me. Two hours  they gave me a message. We are not alone. And then  in the middle of a sentence  at the very birth of twilight  I turned and looked down the street. The stars aligned  and she came back. She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried. Neither did the Liberians  although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back  and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street  holding hands. An event like this leaves a scar on the memory  much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a  Portuguese doctor.  And even now  a decade and a half later  even now that we are married  I look for her still  whenever she is not in the room. And even though  I think you'll agree  it is probable that during the time she was away  she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone  I love her and wait for her still. Thank you for your kind attention. You hear that this is the era of environment    or biology  or information technology ... Well  it's the era of a lot of different things that we're in right now. But one thing for sure  it's the era of change. There's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth. And you all sort of know it  but it's hard to get it so that you really understand it. And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this. I've tried to show in this    though the color doesn't come out    that what I'm concerned with is the little    year time bubble that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past  a generation future    your parents  your kids  things you can change over the next few decades    and this    year time bubble you kind of move along in. And in that    years  if you look at the population curve  you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we're up three and a half times since I was born. When you have a new baby  by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born. This is unprecedented  and it's big. Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part. Now  the human part related to animals  look at the left side of that. What I call the human portion    humans and their livestock and pets    versus the natural portion    all the other wild animals and just    these are vertebrates and all the birds  etc.  in the land and air  not in the water. How does it balance  Certainly         years ago  the civilization's beginning  the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now. You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle    that's your    year time bubble. Humans  livestock and pets are now    percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation doesn't even have to worry about this game    it is over. And the biggest problem came in the last    years  it went from    percent up to that    percent. And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we  humans  are in charge of life on earth  we're like the capricious Gods of old Greek myths  kind of playing with life    and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it. Now  the third curve is information technology. This is Moore's Law plotted here  which relates to density of information  but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology    computers  their use  Internet  etc. And what's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve  and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these. This is the size of the earth going through that same       frame. And to make it really clear  I've put all four on one graph. There's no need to see the little detailed words on it. That first one is humans versus nature  we've won  there's no more gain. Human population. And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into  that's not a good one    protecting natural creatures. Human population is going up  it's going to continue for quite a while. Good business in obstetricians  morticians  and farming  housing  etc.    they all deal with human bodies  which require being fed  transported  housed and so on. And the information technology  which connects to our brains  has no limit    now  that is a wonderful field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity  It's just going up through the roof. And then  the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with. So  that's the stage out of all this. I find  for reasons I don't understand  I really do have a goal. And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age    and I think that's    in other words  the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share. I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically  it's achievable  economically  it's achievable  politically  it means sort of the habits  institutions of people    it's impossible. The institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future  except they're there and we have to deal with them. I spend about    percent of my time trying to save the world  the other    percent  the usual    and whatever else we devote ourselves to. And in that    percent  the main focus is on human mind  thinking skills  somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school  which is putting information and dogma into them  get them so they really think  ask tough questions  argue about serious subjects  don't believe everything that's in the book  think broadly or creative. They can be. Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization  they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff. We can't go into that today because there isn't time    it's a broad subject. One thing for sure  in the future there is an essential feature    necessary  but not sufficient    which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy  less material. Your great great grandparents got by on muscle power  and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient  conserve  recycle  etc. Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done. Human powered airplane    Gossamer Condor sort of started me in this direction in      and     winning the Kremer prize in aviation history  followed by the Albatross. And we began making various odd planes and creatures. Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail. Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job  and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature. This was the full size of the original creature. We did things on land  in the air  on water    vehicles of all different kinds  usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same  whether its land  air or water. I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar powered airplane        miles carrying a person from France to England as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors    the Sunracer    that won the race in Australia. We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars  what you could do with them. A few years later  when we suggested to GM that now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact  they sponsored it  and here's the Impact that we developed with them on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product. With that preamble  let's show the first two minute videotape  which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane. Narrator  A tiny airplane  the AV Pointer serves for surveillance    in effect  a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry  assemble and launch by hand. Battery powered  it is silent and rarely noticed. It sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator. With onboard GPS  it can navigate autonomously  and it is rugged enough to self land without damage. The modern sailplane is superbly efficient. Some can glide as flat as    feet forward for every foot of descent. They are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere    an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy. Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown over       miles  and the altitude record is over        feet. The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol that photovoltaic cells can produce real power and will be part of the world's energy future. In       it flew     miles from Paris to England  solely on the power of sunbeams  and established a basis for the Pathfinder. The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less    gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature. The stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future. Buckminster Fuller said it clearly   there are no passengers on spaceship Earth  only crew. We  the crew  can and must do more with less    much less.  Paul MacCready  If we could have the second video  the one minute  put in as quickly as you can  which    this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii  and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to        feet    higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown. It's amazing  just on the puny power of the sun    by having a super lightweight plane  you're able to get it up there. It's part of a long term program NASA sponsored. And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort  and with wonderful results like that flight. And we're working on a bigger plane        foot span    and an intermediate size  one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day  feed it back at night  and stay up        feet for months at a time. Ray Morgan's voice will come in here. There he's the project manager. Anything they do is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ... some things he showed as a celebration at the very end. Ray Morgan  We'd just ended a seven month deployment of Hawaii. For those who live on the mainland  it was tough being away from home. The friendly support  the quiet confidence  congenial hospitality shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts    this is starting    made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable. PM  We have real time IR scans going out through the Internet while the plane is flying. And it's exploring without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal  the stratosphere  the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is    probing that is very important. And also we consider it as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite  because it can stay right overhead for months at a time        times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite. We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you. But now let's look at the other end. In the video you saw that nine pound or eight pound Pointer airplane surveillance drone that Keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos that have gotten down to  oh     or    grams  his weigh one third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here is a surveillance drone that weighs about   ounces    that includes the video camera  the batteries that run it  the telemetry  the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it  we hope  with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice. So Matt Keenan  just any time you're    all right    ready to let her go. But first  we're going to make sure that it's appearing on the screen  so you see what it sees. You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it  looking out of its camera. Matt Keenan  It's switched on. PM  But now we're trying to get the video. There we go. MK  Can you bring up the house lights  PM  Yeah  the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better. MK  All right  we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in. Here we go. PM  The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it    there it goes. Oh  that was only a minute  but I think you'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight  perhaps. We get to do the classic. All right. If this hits you  it will not hurt you. OK. Thank you very much. Thank you. But now  as they say in infomercials  we have something much better for you  which we're working on  planes that are only six inches       centimeters    in size. And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month  showing what this can lead to. And in a while  something this size will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly nine miles through the air at    miles an hour with just a little battery in it. But there's a lot of technology going. There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things. This one doesn't have the video in it  but you get a little feel from what it can do. OK  here we go. MK  Sorry. OK. PM  If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah  I think    I lost a little orientation  I looked up into this light. It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed  actually. But you're beginning to see what can be done. We're working on projects now    even wing flapping things the size of hawk moths    DARPA contracts  working with Caltech  UCLA. Where all this leads  I don't know. Is it practical  I don't know. But like any basic research  when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology  you can get there with micro technology  nanotechnology. You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales  you realize we have a lot to learn from nature    not with    s    but when you get down to the nature's realm  nature has     million years of experience. It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake  you don't leave any progeny. We should have nothing but success stories from nature  for you or for birds  and we're learning a lot from its fascinating subjects. In concluding  I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective. The first I'll just read. At last  I put in three sentences and had it say what I wanted. Over billions of years on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life    complex  improbable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans    a recently arrived species  no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature    have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush. And that's serious  we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom  we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead  Well  inspired by the sentences  I decided to wield the paintbrush. Every    years I do a picture. Here's the one    tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger. Sort of a timeline  very non linear scale  nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs  and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... Birds were flying overhead  after pterosaurs. And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set with a gun on it. Then traffic jams  and power systems  and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead    I have no idea. And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there  but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast. This is a warning  and we have to think seriously about it. And that time when this is happening is not     years or     years. Things are going on this decade  next decade  it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do. And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be    desirable  sustainable when your kids reach your age    I think we actually can reach it. Now  I said this was a warning  not a forecast. That was before    I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches  and now I'm beginning to wonder seriously    was this more of a forecast than I wanted  I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth is not going to be carbon based  it's going to be silicon based. And so where it all goes  I don't know. The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle  which is a little ornithopter wing flapping device that    rubber band powered    that we'll show you. MK     gram. Sorry  one gram. PM  Last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram. The tube there's hollow  about paper thin. And if this lands on you  I assure you it will not hurt you. But if you reach out to grab it or hold it  you will destroy it. So  be gentle  just act like a wooden Indian or something. And when it comes down    and we'll see how it goes. We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED. And you wonder  is it practical  And it turns out if I had not been    Unfortunately  we have some light bulb changes. We can probably get it down  but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there       than it ever had. And I wanted to make    just    But I want to make just two points. One is  you think it's frivolous  there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters like that  a little bit cruder  in         a long  long time ago    there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor  there wouldn't have been an Albatross  a Solar Challenger  there wouldn't be an Impact car  there wouldn't be a mandate on zero emission vehicles in California. A lot of these things    or similar    would have happened some time  probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time I was doing inquiry based  hands on things with teams  like they're trying to get in education systems. So I think that  as a symbol  it's important. And I believe that also is important. You can think of it as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature  and puts it all together in things that are    that make this conference  I think  more important than any that's taken place in this country in this decade. Thank you.  Applause  I grew up in Europe  and World War II caught me when I was between seven and    years old. And I realized how few of the grown ups that I knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them    how few of them could even resemble a normal  contented  satisfied  happy life once their job  their home  their security was destroyed by the war. So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living. And I tried  as a child  as a teenager  to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question. And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance. I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself  because the snow had melted and I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the    I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich  and it was about flying saucers  that  he was going to talk. And I thought  well  since I can't go to the movies  at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers. And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting. Instead of talking about little green men  he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war  and now they're projecting flying saucers into the sky. He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war. And this seemed very interesting to me. And I started reading his books after that lecture. And that was Carl Jung  whose name or work I had no idea about. Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness. This is a typical result that many people have presented  and there are many variations on it. But this  for instance  shows that about    percent of the people surveyed in the United States since      say that their life is very happy. And that hasn't changed at all. Whereas the personal income  on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation  has more than doubled  almost tripled  in that period. But you find essentially the same results  namely  that after a certain basic point    which corresponds more or less to just a few       dollars above the minimum poverty level    increases in material well being don't seem to affect how happy people are. In fact  you can find that the lack of basic resources  material resources  contributes to unhappiness  but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness. So my research has been focused more on    after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience  I tried to understand  where    in everyday life  in our normal experience    do we feel really happy  And to start those studies about    years ago  I began to look at creative people    first artists and scientists  and so forth    trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune  but which made their life meaningful and worth doing. This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '  s. And the interview was    pages long. But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview. And it describes how he feels when composing is going well. And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state. Now   ecstasy  in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something. And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines. So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality. And it's interesting  if you think about it  how  when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement    whether it's China  Greece  the Hindu civilization  or the Mayas  or Egyptians    what we know about them is really about their ecstasies  not about their everyday life. We know the temples they built  where people could come to experience a different reality. We know about the circuses  the arenas  the theaters. These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated  more ordered form. Now  this man doesn't need to go to a place like this  which is also    this place  this arena  which is built like a Greek amphitheatre  is a place for ecstasy also. We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we're used to. But this man doesn't need to go there. He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks  and as he does that  he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination. So once he gets to that point of beginning to create  like Jennifer did in her improvisation  a new reality    that is  a moment of ecstasy    he enters that different reality. Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist. And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration. But actually  our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about     bits of information per second. And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying  you need to process about    bits per second. That's why you can't hear more than two people. You can't understand more than two people talking to you. Well  when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new  as this man is  he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels  or his problems at home. He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired. His body disappears  his identity disappears from his consciousness  because he doesn't have enough attention  like none of us do  to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration  and at the same time to feel that he exists. So existence is temporarily suspended. And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself. Now  I could look at my hand for two weeks  and I wouldn't feel any awe or wonder  because I can't compose.  Laughter  So what it's telling you here is that obviously this automatic  spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique. And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than    years of technical knowledge immersion in a particular field. Whether it's mathematics or music  it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before. Now  when that happens  he says the music just flows out. And because all of these people I started interviewing    this was an interview which is over    years old    so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the  flow experience.  And it happens in different realms. For instance  a poet describes it in this form. This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States. And it describes the same effortless  spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state. This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky    a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity  when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked. But it happens in other activities. For instance  this is another student of mine  Susan Jackson from Australia  who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world. And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater  the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person. You don't think  it goes automatically  if you merge yourself with the music  and so forth. It happens also  actually  in the most recent book I wrote  called  Good Business   where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical  very socially responsible. You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it. And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say  you can't have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job. Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed. She is the founder of Body Shop  the natural cosmetics king. It's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working. This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka  who was at that time starting out Sony without any money  without a product    they didn't have a product  they didn't have anything  but they had an idea. And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation  be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content. I couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace. Now  when we do studies    we have  with other colleagues around the world  done over       interviews of people    from Dominican monks  to blind nuns  to Himalayan climbers  to Navajo shepherds    who enjoy their work. And regardless of the culture  regardless of education or whatever  there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow. There's this focus that  once it becomes intense  leads to a sense of ecstasy  a sense of clarity  you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other  you get immediate feedback. You know that what you need to do is possible to do  even though difficult  and sense of time disappears  you forget yourself  you feel part of something larger. And once the conditions are present  what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake. In our studies  we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme. And we can measure this very precisely  actually  because we give people electronic pagers that go off    times a day  and whenever they go off you say what you're doing  how you feel  where you are  what you're thinking about. And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment. So for each person we can establish an average  which is the center of the diagram. That would be your mean level of challenge and skill  which will be different from that of anybody else. But you have a kind of a set point there  which would be in the middle. If we know what that set point is  we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow  and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average. And you may be doing things very differently from other people  but for everyone that flow channel  that area there  will be when you are doing what you really like to do    play the piano  be with your best friend  perhaps work  if work is what provides flow for you. And then the other areas become less and less positive. Arousal is still good because you are over challenged there. Your skills are not quite as high as they should be  but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill. So  arousal is the area where most people learn from  because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone and to enter that    going back to flow    then they develop higher skills. Control is also a good place to be  because there you feel comfortable  but not very excited. It's not very challenging any more. And if you want to enter flow from control  you have to increase the challenges. So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into. The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal. Relaxation is fine    you still feel OK. Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative  you don't feel that you're doing anything  you don't use your skills  there's no challenge. Unfortunately  a lot of people's experience is in apathy. The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television  the next one is being in the bathroom  sitting. Even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow  but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it. So the question we are trying to address    and I'm way over time    is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel. And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand. And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice  but unfortunately a lot of people don't. And that's what our mandate is  in a way  to do. Thank you. When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe  it was difficult to understand that    percent of the population is HIV positive. It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic. For instance  this is Herbert with his grandmother. When I first met him  he was sitting on his grandmother's lap. He has been orphaned  as both of his parents died of AIDS  and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS. He liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed. When she got up to make tea  she placed him in my own lap and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated. Before I left  I actually asked him if I could get him something. I thought he would ask for a toy  or candy  and he asked me for slippers  because he said that his feet were cold. This is Joyce who's    in this picture      . Single mother  HIV positive. I photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl  Issa. And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan and got a call from a woman who I didn't know  but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away at the age of   . Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter  like so many other Zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic. So a few of the stories. With every picture  there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told. All these pictures are from Zimbabwe. Chris Anderson  Kirsten  will you just take one minute  just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa  Kirsten Ashburn  Mmm  gosh. CA  Just    KA  Actually  I was working at the time  doing production for a fashion photographer. And I was constantly reading the New York Times  and stunned by the statistics  the numbers. It was just frightening. So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle. And I first actually went to Botswana  where I spent a month    this is in December         then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half  and then went back again this March      for another month and a half in Zimbabwe. CA  That's an amazing story  thank you. KB  Thanks for letting me show these. I think all of us have been interested  at one time or another  in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed  such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan  the Easter Islanders  the Anasazi  Fertile Crescent society  Angor Wat  Great Zimbabwe and so on. And within the last decade or two  archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses. But there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse  such as Japan  Java  Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently  societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas. How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies  The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today  because today as well  there are some societies that have already collapsed  such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also societies today that may be close to collapse  such as Nepal  Indonesia and Columbia. What about ourselves  What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have  Obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single factor explanation for societal collapses  you know right away that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject. But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject  In analyzing societal collapses  I've arrived at a five point framework    a checklist of things that I go through to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five point framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society. This is a European society with literate records  so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation. In AD     Vikings went out to Greenland  settled Greenland  and around      they died out    the society collapsed  and every one of them ended up dead. Why did they all end up dead  Well  in my five point framework  the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment  people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse  the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation  which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal  to make iron. So they ended up an Iron Age European society  virtually unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter. In the case of the Vikings    in Greenland  the climate got colder in the late     s  and especially in the     s. But a cold climate isn't necessarily fatal  because the Inuit    the Eskimos inhabiting Greenland at the same time    did better  rather than worse  with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well  The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that friendly support is pulled away  that may make a society more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse  they had trade with the mother country    Norway    and that trade dwindled  partly because Norway got weaker  partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway. The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies. In the case of Norse Greenland  the hostiles were the Inuit    the Eskimos sharing Greenland    with whom the Norse got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit killed the Norse and  probably of greater importance  may have blocked access to the outer fjords  on which the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year. And then finally  the fifth item on my checklist is the political  economic  social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse  cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were  their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals  their being a competitive ranked chiefly society  and their scorn for the Inuit  from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse. What about a society today  For the past five years  I've been taking my wife and kids to Southwestern Montana  where I worked as a teenager on the hay harvest. And Montana  at first sight  seems like the most pristine environment in the United States. But scratch the surface  and Montana suffers from serious problems. Going through the same checklist  human environmental impacts  Yes  acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste have caused damage of billions of dollars. Problems from weeds  weed control  cost Montana nearly     million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization  problems of forest management  problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist  climate change. Yes    the climate in Montana is getting warmer and drier  but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack  and as the snow is melting    for example  as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing    that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture. Third thing on my checklist  relations with friendlies that can sustain the society. In Montana today  more than half of the income of Montana is not earned within Montana  but is derived from out of state  transfer payments from social security  investments and so on    which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States. Fourth  relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems as do all Americans  in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies  and terrorist attacks. And finally  last item on my checklist  question of how political  economic  social  cultural attitudes play into this. Montanans have long held values  which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems. Long held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture  and to no government regulation  values that worked well in the past  but they don't seem to be working well today. So  I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies. Are there any general conclusions that arise  In a way  just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage being different  every collapsed or endangered society is different    they all have different details. But nevertheless  there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread has to do with  in many cases  the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies that don't wind down gradually  but they build up    get richer and more powerful    and then within a short time  within a few decades after their peak  they collapse. For example  the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the early    s    literally a few decades after the Maya were building their biggest monuments  and Maya population was greatest. Or again  the collapse of the Soviet Union took place within a couple of decades  maybe within a decade  of the time when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power. An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish. These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption  or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential. In a petri dish  bacteria grow. Say they double every generation  and five generations before the end the petri dish is      ths empty  and then the next generation's    ths empty  and the next generation half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty  it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed. So  this is a frequent theme  societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power. What it means to put it mathematically is that  if you're concerned about a society today  you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function    the wealth itself    but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme is that there are many  often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors are not well understood. For example  why is it that in the Pacific  of those hundreds of Pacific islands  why did Easter Island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation  It turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors    some  rather subtle ones    that were working against the Easter Islanders  and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra  latitude  rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the Pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia. Easter  of all Pacific islands  has the least input of dust from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's a factor that we didn't even appreciate until     . So  some societies  for subtle environmental reasons  are more fragile than others. And then finally  another generalization. I'm now teaching a course at UCLA  to UCLA undergraduates  on these collapses of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is  how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing  How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment  What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree  Didn't they see what they were doing  How could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time  And I would expect that  if our human civilization carries on  then maybe in the next century people will be asking  why on earth did these people today in the year      not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action  It seems incredible in the past. In the future  it'll seem incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems    why they fail to perceive the problems or  if they perceive them  why they fail to tackle them. Or  if they tackle them  why do they fail to succeed in solving them  I'll just mention two generalizations in this area. One blueprint for trouble  making collapse likely  is where there is a conflict of interest between the short term interest of the decision making elites and the long term interest of the society as a whole  especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole  there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run. For example  among the Greenland Norse    a competitive rank society    what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs to do what's called flogging the land  overstocking the land  forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made the chiefs powerful in the short run  but led to the society's collapse in the long run. Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute in the United States today. Especially because the decision makers in the United States are frequently able to insulate themselves from consequences by living in gated compounds  by drinking bottled water and so on. And within the last couple of years  it's been obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance their short term interest by doing things that are good for them but bad for society as a whole  such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron and other businesses. They are quite correct that these things are good for them in the short term  although bad for society in the long term. So  that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions  conflicts of interest. And the other generalization that I want to mention is that it's particularly hard for a society to make quote unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances. For example  the Greenland Norse  in this difficult environment  were held together for four and a half centuries by their shared commitment to religion  and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things    commitment to religion and strong social cohesion    also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the Inuit. Or today    Australia. One of the things that enabled Australia to survive in this remote outpost of European civilization for     years has been their British identity. But today  their commitment to a British identity is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength. What's going to be the outcome today  Well  all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world  time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to    all of them  not more than    years  and any one of which can do us in  the time bombs of water  of soil  of climate change  invasive species  the photosynthetic ceiling  population problems  toxics  etc.  etc.    listing about    of them. And while these time bombs    none of them has a fuse beyond    years  and most of them have fuses of a few decades    some of them  in some places  have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now  the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest  which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me  Jared  what's the most important thing that we need to do about the world's environmental problems  And my answer is  the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do. Instead  there are a dozen things  any one of which could do us in. And we've got to get them all right  because if we solve     we fail to solve the   th    we're in trouble. For example  if we solve our problems of water and soil and population  but don't solve our problems of toxics  then we are in trouble. The fact is that our present course is a non sustainable course  which means  by definition  that it cannot be maintained. And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades. That means that those of us in this room who are less than    or    years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved  and those of us who are over the age of    may not see the resolution  but our children and grandchildren certainly will. The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms  either we will resolve these non sustainable time fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action  or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice    namely  by war  disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our non sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades. In other words  since the theme of this session is choices  we have a choice. Does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed  I draw the reverse conclusion. The big problems facing the world today are not at all things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us  something we can do nothing about. Instead  all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems  we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems. In particular  what can all of us do  For those of you who are interested in these choices  there are lots of things you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand  and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that we already do understand  but aren't doing  and that we need to be doing. Thank you. Zach Kaplan  Keith and I lead a research team. We investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years  we found over     of these things  and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for TED. Of these six  the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding. It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up. Keith Schacht  Now be sure and take the two pieces apart. What's unexpected about this is that it's soft  but it's also a strong magnet. Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this. We spent a long time thinking about why this is  and it's just recently that we realized  it's when we see something unexpected  it changes our understanding of the way things work. As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time  if you assume that all magnets had to be hard  then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work. ZK  Now  it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are. But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible  we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world. So  a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors. If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material    if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise  and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed. Imagine taking the same material  but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker. You know  this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door  in your closet  and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf. For me  I really love this idea. If you come to my apartment and see my closet  I'm sure you'd figure out why  it's a mess. KS  Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications    it helps you see why this is significant  what the potential is. But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference. ZK  It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.  and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola. He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company  The Directors Bureau. As we were talking  Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side. And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand    and you know  we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face  Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder  he opens it up and Keith and I look in  and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on. These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts  and we were just like  whoa  this guy's good. Because the way that he presented the concept    his approach was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now. When we were going in the car back to the airport  we were thinking  why was this so powerful  And as we thought about it more  we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience  just as if you saw it on TV. So  for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future. Narrator  Do you have a need for speed  Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically levitating board down a waterslide so fast  so tall  that when you hit the bottom  it uses brakes to stop. Aqua Rocket  coming this summer. KS  Now  we showed the concept to a few people before this  and they asked us  when's it coming out  So I just wanted to let you know  it's not actually coming out  just the concept is. ZK  So now  when we dream up these concepts  it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint. So I just want to quickly explain how this would work. This is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial. The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board. Now this is important for two reasons. One  the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that  if it were to hit the rider in the head  it wouldn't injure him. In addition  you can see from the diagram on the right  the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet. So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down. The force of the water rushing down  in addition to that repulsion force  would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market. It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system. When you get to the very bottom of the slide       the rider passes through an aluminum tube. And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint. KS  So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal  it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube. So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you. Now  you see the magnet fell really slowly. Now  I'm not going to get into the physics of it  but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling  the greater the stopping force. ZK  Now  our next technology is actually a    foot pole  and I have it right here in my pocket. There're a few different versions of it. KS  Some of them automatically unroll like this one. They can be made to automatically roll up  or they can be made stable  like Zach's  to hold any position in between. ZK  As we were talking to the vendor    to try to learn about how you could apply these  or how they're being applied currently    he was telling us that  in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests    very concealed    and then  when they're out on the field  erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base. In our brainstorms  we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal  so at the end of the game  you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag. KS  Now  the interesting thing about this is  you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a    foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting. So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this. Man  I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house    I do it that way. Woman  I'd make my very own walking stick. Woman  I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree. Woman  An olive server. Man  Some type of extension pole    like what the painters use. Woman  I would make a spear that  when you went deep sea diving  you could catch the fish really fast  and then roll it back up  and you could swim easier ... Yeah. ZK  Now  for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration  and so we need a volunteer from the audience. You sir  come on up. Come on up. Tell everybody your name. Steve Jurvetson  Steve. ZK  It's Steve. All right Steve  now  follow me. We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign. Right there. That's great. And hold onto this. Good luck to you. KS  No  not yet. ZK  I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target. KS  Little bit    that's perfect  just perfect. Now  Zach  we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future. So here  come on up to the front. All right  so now if you'll see here    no  no  it's OK. So  describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead. SJ  It's cold. KS  Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns    it's a dry liquid developed by  M. It's perfectly clear  it's odorless  it's colorless. It's so safe you could drink this stuff. And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates    times faster than water. All right  well thanks for coming up. ZK  Wait  wait  Steven    before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends. SJ  Excellent  thank you. KS  Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause. So what's the significance of this dry liquid  Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer. Now  the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics  that we'd get him wet  that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non conductive. So you can see here  you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage. You can circulate it to draw the heat away. But today it's most widely used in office buildings    in the sprinkler system    as a fire suppression fluid. Again  it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires  doesn't hurt anything. But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime  it could rain down on the players  cool everyone down  and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court. ZK  Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R D engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer. While he was doing this  he noticed an unexpected thing. We have a video to show you. KS  So you see there  it didn't bounce back. Now  this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing. It's technically called   shape retaining property.  Now  think about your interactions with aluminum foil. Shape retaining is common in metal  you bend a piece of aluminum foil  and it holds its place. Contrast that with a plastic garbage can    and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back. ZK  For example  you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist  but doesn't use a buckle. Taking it a little further  if you wove those strips together    kind of like a little basket    you could make a shape retaining sheet  and then you could embed it in a cloth  so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table  so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away. For our next technology  it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself  because it's an ink. So  we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper. KS  As this paper is bending  the resistance of the ink changes. So with simple electronics  you can detect how much the page is being bent. Now  to think about the potential for this  think of all the places ink is supplied  on business cards  on the back of cereal boxes  board games. Any place you use ink  you could change the way you interact with it. ZK  So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book. This could totally change the way that you interface with paper. You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages of the book  the book can actually detect what page you're on  based on the curvature of the pages. In addition  if you were to fold in one of the corners  then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes. KS  For our last technology  we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works. Old Milk Carton  Oh yeah  it smells good. Who are you  New Milk Carton  I'm New Milk. OMC  I used to smell like you. Narrator  Fresh Watch  from Inventables Dairy Farms. Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off. Don't let milk spoil your morning. ZK  Now  this technology was developed by these two guys  Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow  of the University of Illinois. KS  Now the way it works  there's a matrix of color dyes. And these dyes change color in response to odors. So the smell of vanilla  that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells. But like in the milk commercial  if you know what odor you want to detect  then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor. ZK  Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself  and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible  beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies. His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn  how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene  And he kind of comically explained that time after time  what the firemen would say is  they would rush to the scene of the crime  they would look around  if there were no dead policemen  it was OK to go. I mean  this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries. But more seriously  they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans  and say if it's safe for the firemen. In addition  he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing  where they're working on medical equipment. So  a patient can come in and actually blow into their device. By detecting the odor of particular bacteria  or viruses  or even lung cancer  the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results. This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients. Currently  they're using a method of trial and error  but this could tell you precisely what disease you have. KS  So that was the six we had for you today  but I hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating. Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this  we would have assumed  a    foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket  something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent  every one of these things    and we're constantly trying to find more. ZK  This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing. I'm sure it's obvious to you now  but it was actually yesterday that I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation with Steve Jurvetson  over downstairs by the escalators  and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box  one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand    the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son. And you know  his son was mesmerized  because he would dunk it in the water  he would take it out and it was bone dry. A few weeks later  he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair  and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair. And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said   Look  hydrophobic string.  I mean  after hearing that story    that really summed it up for me. Thank you very much. KS  Thank you. This is very strange for me  because I m not used to doing this  I usually stand on the other side of the light  and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ... The previous speaker has  I think  really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me  and my sense of loss  and trying to find the answer to the big questions. But this  for me  I mean  coming here to do this  feels like    there s this sculptor that I like very much  Giacometti  who after many years of living in France    and learning  you know  studying and working    he returned home and he was asked  what did you produce  What have you done with so many years of being away  And he sort of  he showed a handful of figurines. And obviously they were   Is this what you spent years doing  And we expected huge masterpieces   But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man s life  search  thought  everything    just in a reduced  small version. In a way  I feel like that. I feel like I m coming home to talk about what I ve been away doing for    years. And I will start with a brief taster of what I ve been about  a handful of films    nothing much  two feature films and a handful of short films. So  we ll go with the first piece. I love her  you know. She s not even my real mum. My real mum and dad dumped me and fucked off back to Nigeria. The devil is in me  Court. Court  Sleep. Woman  Have you ever been  Court  Where  Woman  Nigeria. Court  Never. My mum wanted to  couldn t afford it. Woman  Wish I could. I have this feeling I d be happy there.

The first clip  really  is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me  and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema. The first piece was  really  there's a young woman talking about Nigeria  that she has a feeling she'll be happy there. These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home. And that was something that I went through  you know  and I'm still going through. I've not been home for quite a while  for about five years now. I've been away    years in total. And so it s really    it's really how suddenly  you know  this was made in       which is the time of Abacha    the military dictatorship  the worst part of Nigerian history  this post colonial history. So  for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is. How    and it's sort of  perhaps romantic  but I think beautiful  because you just need something to hold on to  especially in a society where you feel alienated. Which takes us to the next piece  where the young man talks about lack of opportunity  living as a black person in Europe  the glass ceiling that we all know about  that we all talk about  and his reality. Again  this was my    this was me talking about    this was  again  the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom  and there was this buzzword    and it was trying to say  what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people  And what would a child    what does a child like Jamie    the young boy    think  I mean  with all this anger that's built up inside of him  What happens with that  What  of course  happens with that is violence  which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about  you know  South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff  and which eventually  when channeled  becomes  you know  evolves and manifests itself as riots    like the one in France two years ago  where I live  which shocked everybody  because everyone thought   Oh well  France is a liberal society.  But I lived in England for    years. I've lived in France for about four  and I feel actually thrown back    years  living in France. And then  the third piece. The third piece for me is the question  What is cinema to you  What do you do with cinema  There's a young director  Hollywood director  with his friends    fellow filmmakers    talking about what cinema means. I suppose that will take me to my last piece    what cinema means for me. My life started as a    I started life in       a few months before the Biafran  which lasted for three years and it was three years of war. So that whole thing  that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece. Onicha  Yes  mama. Commander  Soldiers  you are going to fight a battle  so you must get ready and willing to die.

More than that  begin a healing process and finally to    as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country s history. The beginning of hope. Mr. Ezra Gelehun  please stand. State your name and age for the commission. Ezra  My name is Ezra Gelehun. I am    or   . I don t remember. Ask my sister  she is the witch  she knows everything. CC  Mr. Gelehun  I d like to remind you you re not on trial here for any crimes you committed. E  We were fighting for our freedom. If killing in a war is a crime  then you have to charge every soldier in the world. War is a crime  yes  but I did not start it. You too are a retired General  not so  CC  Yes  correct. E  So you too must stand trial then. Our government was corrupt. Lack of education was their way to control power. If I may ask  do you pay for school in your country  CC  No  we don t. E  You are richer than us. But we pay for school. Your country talks about democracy  but you support corrupt governments like my own. Why  Because you want our diamond. Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before  No. CC  Mr. Gelehun  I'd like to remind you  you're not on trial here today. You are not on trial. E  Then let me go. CC  I can't do that  son. E  So you are a liar. NA  Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here  is that while we re making all these huge advancements  what we're doing  which for me  you know  I think we should    Africa should move forward  but we should remember  so we do not go back here again. Thank you. Emeka Okafor  Thank you  Newton. One of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers. And considering where you are coming from  and when we consider the extent to which it s not taken as seriously as it should be  what would you have to say about that  NA  In the process of my research  I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this. And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers    ex combatants  as they like to be called. I met psychosocial workers who worked with them. I met psychiatrists who spent time with them  aid workers  NGOs  the whole lot. But I remember on the flight back on my last trip  I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself  if any kid in the West  in the western world  went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through  they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives. So for me  the thought that we have all these children    it s a generation  we have a whole generation of children    who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage  and Africa has to live with that. But I m just saying to factor that in  factor that in with all this great advancement  all this pronouncement of great achievement. That s really my thinking. EO  Well  we thank you again for coming to the TED stage. That was a very moving piece. NA  Thank you. EO  Thank you. One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy. I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life. So when I thought about compassion  my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips  where he's lying there and he says   I really understand  and I really appreciate how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself. The only trouble is the people next door  I can't stand them.  This  in a way  is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea. We all  I think  believe in compassion. If you look at all the world religions  all the main world religions  you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion. So in Judaism  we have  from our Torah  that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself. And within Jewish teachings  the rabbinic teachings  we have Hillel  who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself. And all the main religions have similar teachings. And again  within Judaism  we have a teaching about God  who is called the compassionate one  Ha rachaman. After all  how could the world exist without God being compassionate  And we  as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God  so we too have to be compassionate. But what does it mean  How does it impact on our everyday life  Sometimes  of course  being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control. I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral  or when I have been sitting with the bereaved  or with people who are dying  and I am overwhelmed by the sadness  by the difficulty  the challenge that is there for the family  for the person. And I'm touched  so that tears come to my eyes. And yet  if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings  I wouldn't be doing my job    because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen  that practicalities are seen to. And yet  on the other hand  if I didn't feel this compassion  then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi. And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world. Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war  or famine  or earthquakes  or tsunamis  I know some people who say  Well  you know there's just so much out there    I can't do anything  I'm not going to even begin to try.  And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue. There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore  and so they turn off the television and don't watch. In Judaism  though  we tend to always say  there has to be a middle way. You have to  of course  be aware of the needs of others  but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people. So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick. And  of course  you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more. And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation  which says that when God created the world  God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice. Because  after all  God is just. Therefore  there should be justice throughout the world. And then God looked to the future and realized  if the world was created just with justice  the world couldn't exist. So  God thought   Nope  I'm going to create the world just with compassion.  And then God looked to the future and realized that  in fact  if the world were just filled with compassion  there would be anarchy and chaos. There had to be limits to all things. The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful  fragile glass bowl. If you put too much cold water in  it will shatter. If you put boiling water in  it will shatter. What do you have to do  Put in a mixture of the two. And so God put both of these possibilities into the world. There is something more though that has to be there. And that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world  into action. So  like Snoopy  we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors. We actually have to do something about it. And so there is also  within Judaism  this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important   chesed.  All these three things  then  have to be melded together. The idea of justice  which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life  what's right about living  what should we be doing  social justice. There has to be a willingness to do good deeds  but not  of course  at the expense of our own sanity. You know  there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion  which has to be there  if you like  at our very roots. This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God  who is ultimately the compassionate one. What does this compassion entail  It entails understanding the pain of the other. But even more than that  it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation  understanding that one is part of that creation  that there is a unity that underlies all that we see  all that we hear  all that we feel. I call that unity God. And that unity is something that connects all of creation. And  of course  in the modern world  with the environmental movement  we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things  that something I do here actually does matter in Africa  that if I use too much of my carbon allowance  it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa. So there is a connectivity  and I have to understand that    as part of the creation  as part of me being made in the image of God. And I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs. This     minutes  business  I find quite fascinating. Because in Judaism  the number     in Hebrew letters  stands for life    the word  life.  So  in a sense  the    minutes is challenging me to say   In life  this is what's important in terms of compassion.  But  something else as well  actually     minutes is important. Because at Passover  when we have to eat unleavened bread  the rabbis say  what is the difference between dough that is made into bread  and dough that is made into unleavened bread  or  matzah   And they say  It's    minutes.  Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven. What does it mean   dough becomes leaven   It means it gets filled with hot air. What's matzah  What's unleavened bread  You don't get it. Symbolically  what the rabbis say is that at Passover  what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air    our pride  our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world  and that everything should revolve round us. So we try and get rid of those  and so doing  try to get rid of the habits  the emotions  the ideas that enslave us  that make our eyes closed  give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others    and free ourselves and free ourselves from that. And that too is a basis for having compassion  for understanding our place in the world. Now there is  in Judaism  a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day. And  as many people do  he was dozing off during the sermon. And as he was dozing off  they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah. And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem  the priests used to have bread  which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem. The man was asleep  but he heard the words bread  temple  God  and he woke up. He said   God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants.  And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath  he made    loaves of bread  took them to the synagogue  went into the synagogue  opened the ark and said   God  I don't know why you want this bread  but here you are.  And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah. Then he went home. The cleaner came into the synagogue.  Oh God  I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed. My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do   He goes into the synagogue.  God  will you please help me  Ah  what a wonderful smell.  He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.  There's bread  God  you've answered my plea. You've answered my question.  Takes the bread and goes home. Meanwhile  the rich man thinks to himself   I'm an idiot. God wants bread  God  the one who rules the entire universe  wants my bread   He rushes to the synagogue.  I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it.  He goes in there  and it's not there. And he says   God  you really did want it. You wanted my bread. Next week  with raisins.  This went on for years. Every week  the man would bring bread with raisins  with all sorts of good things  put it into the ark. Every week  the cleaner would come.  God you've answered my plea again.  Take the bread. Take it home. Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things. The rabbi came in and saw what was going on. And he called the two of them to his office. And he said  you know   This is what's happening.  And the rich man    oh  dear    crestfallen.  You mean God didn't want my bread   And the poor man said   And you mean God didn't answer my pleas   And the rabbi said   You've misunderstood me. You've misunderstood totally   he said.  Of course  what you are doing   he said to the rich man   is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate. And God   he said to the poor man   is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give.  He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said   Don't you understand   He said   These are the hands of God.  So that is the way I feel  that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate  of understanding that there is a connectivity  that there is a unity in this world  that I want to try and serve that unity  and that I can try and do that by understanding  I hope  trying to understand something of the pain of others  but understanding that there are limits  that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them  and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy  to the giving I can give. I have to reevaluate them  try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me  so that I can see the world clearly. And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God. And so try to bring compassion to life in this world. A human child is born  and for quite a long time is a consumer. It cannot be consciously a contributor. It is helpless. It doesn't know how to survive  even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive. It needs the help of mother  or a foster mother  to survive. It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child. It has to totally surrender  as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist. It has to totally surrender. That implies a lot of trust. That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust. As the child grows  it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust. It doesn't know even the word  violation.  Therefore  it has to blame itself  a wordless blame  which is more difficult to really resolve    the wordless self blame. As the child grows to become an adult  so far  it has been a consumer  but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute  to be a contributor. One cannot contribute unless one feels secure  one feels big  one feels  I have enough. To be compassionate is not a joke. It's not that simple. One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself. That bigness should be centered on oneself  not in terms of money  not in terms of power you wield  not in terms of any status that you can command in the society  but it should be centered on oneself. The self  you are self aware. On that self  it should be centered    a bigness  a wholeness. Otherwise  compassion is just a word and a dream. You can be compassionate occasionally  more moved by empathy than by compassion. Thank God we are empathetic. When somebody's in pain  we pick up the pain. In a Wimbledon final match  these two guys fight it out. Each one has got two games. It can be anybody's game. What they have sweated so far has no meaning. One person wins. The tennis etiquette is  both the players have to come to the net and shake hands. The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground  throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it. And this guy has to come to the net. When he comes to the net  you see  his whole face changes. It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win. Why  Empathy. That's human heart. No human heart is denied of that empathy. No religion can demolish that by indoctrination. No culture  no nation and nationalism    nothing can touch it because it is empathy. And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people  you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life    even words  even time. Compassion is not defined in one form. There's no Indian compassion. There's no American compassion. It transcends nation  the gender  the age. Why  Because it is there in everybody. It's experienced by people occasionally. Then this occasional compassion  we are not talking about    it will never remain occasional. By mandate  you cannot make a person compassionate. You can't say   Please love me.  Love is something you discover. It's not an action  but in the English language  it is also an action. I will come to it later. So one has got to discover a certain wholeness. I am going to cite the possibility of being whole  which is within our experience  everybody's experience. In spite of a very tragic life  one is happy in moments which are very few and far between. And the one who is happy  even for a slapstick joke  accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself. That means the whole universe  known things and unknown things. All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself. The subject     me     and the object    the scheme of things    fuse into oneness  an experience nobody can say   I am denied of   an experience common to all and sundry. That experience confirms that  in spite of all your limitations    all your wants  desires  unfulfilled  and the credit cards and layoffs and  finally  baldness    you can be happy. But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy. You are the very happiness  the wholeness that you want to be. There's no choice in this  that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you  cannot be minus you. It has got to be you. You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole. Your moment of happiness reveals that reality  that realization  that recognition   Maybe I am the whole. Maybe the swami is right. Maybe the swami is right.  You start your new life. Then everything becomes meaningful. I have no more reason to blame myself. If one has to blame oneself  one has a million reasons plus many. But if I say  in spite of my body being limited    if it is black it is not white  if it is white it is not black  body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited. Your knowledge is limited  health is limited  and power is therefore limited  and the cheerfulness is going to be limited. Compassion is going to be limited. Everything is going to be limitless. You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless  and nobody can become limitless  either you are or you are not. Period. And there is no way of your being not limitless too. Your own experience reveals  in spite of all limitations  you are the whole. And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. It is love first. When you relate to the world  the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is  what we say  love. And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion. Then that again transforms into giving  into sharing. You express yourself because you have compassion. To discover compassion  you need to be compassionate. To discover the capacity to give and share  you need to be giving and sharing. There is no shortcut  it is like swimming by swimming. You learn swimming by swimming. You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water. You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling. You learn cooking by cooking  having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook. And  therefore  what I say  you have to fake it and make it. You need to. My predecessor meant that. You have to act it out. You have to act compassionately. There is no verb for compassion  but you have an adverb for compassion. That's interesting to me. You act compassionately. But then  how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion  That is where you fake. You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America. You fake it and make it. You act compassionately as though you have compassion  grind your teeth  take all the support system. If you know how to pray  pray. Ask for compassion. Let me act compassionately. Do it. You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion  and slowly  perhaps if you get the right teaching  you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself  which is oneness  wholeness  and that's what you are. With these words  thank you very much. Compassion  what does it look like  Come with me to     South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh  North Carolina  where I grew up. If you come in you will see us  evening time  at table    set for ten but not always all seats filled    at the point when dinner is ready to be served. Since mom had eight kids  sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were. Before we could eat  she would ask   Are all the children in   And if someone happened to be missing  we would have to  we say   Fix a plate  for that person  put it in the oven  then we could say grace  and we could eat. Also  while we were at the table  there was a ritual in our family  when something significant had happened for any one of us    whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA  or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination  or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent    the ritual at the family was  once the announcement is made  we must take five  ten minutes to do what we call  make over  that person    that is  to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way. For when one is honored  all are honored. Also  we had to make a report on our extended  visited  members  that is  extended members of the family  sick and elderly  shut in. My task was  at least once a week  to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street  Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue  and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road. Why  Because they were old and infirm  and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything. For mom said   To be family  is to care and share and to look out for one another. They are our family.  And  of course  sometimes there was a bonus for going. They would offer sweets or money. Mom says   If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them  you must always say  'Nothing.' And if they insist  say  'Whatever you mind to give me.'  This was the nature of being at that table. In fact  she indicated that if we would do that  not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family  but she said   Even God will smile  and when God smiles  there is peace  and justice  and joy.  So  at the table at      I learned something about compassion. Of course  it was a minister's family  so we had to add God into it. And so  I came to think that mama eternal  mama eternal  is always wondering  Are all the children in  And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing  we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world. Now  it was not always wonderful at that table. Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion. It was Christmas  and at our family  oh  what a morning. Christmas morning  where we open up our gifts  where we have special prayers  and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment. In fact  you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing  and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed  except that daddy messed it up. There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate. And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration. We thought he must be out of his mind. This is our time. This is intimate time. This is when we can just be who we are  and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on  while we are still in our PJs. Why would daddy bring Elder Revels  Any other time  but not to the Christmas celebration. And mom overheard us and said   Well  you know what  If you really understand the nature of this celebration  it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love. That's what the celebration is all about. It's time to make space  to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community.  So  we sucked up. But growing up at      compassion was not a word to be debated  it was a sensibility to how we are together. We are sisters and brothers united together. And  like Chief Seattle said   We did not spin the web of life. We're all strands in it. And whatever we do to the web  we do to ourselves.  Now that's compassion. So  let me tell you  I kind of look at the world this way. I see pictures  and something says   Now  that's compassion.  A harvested field of grain  with some grain in the corners  reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest  but you must always leave some on the edges  just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture. Talk about a picture of compassion. I see    always  it stirs my heart    a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr. walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled  walking across the bridge and going into Selma. Just a photograph. Arm in arm for struggle. Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being. So  there's another picture. Here  this one. I really do like this picture. When Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr. was assassinated  that day  everybody in my community was upset. You heard about riots all across the land. Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis. This is the picture. They said   It's going to be too volatile for you to go.  He insisted   I must go.  So  sitting on a flatbed truck  the elders of the community are there  and Bobby stands up and says to the people   I have bad news for you. Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated. I know that you are angry  and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But   he said   what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel. Because I had someone dear to me snatched away. I know how you feel.  And he said   I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did. I allowed my anger  my bitterness  my grief to simmer a while  and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world  and we can do that together.  That's a picture. Compassion  I think I see it. I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor  and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world. He asked them to give a message  and they each read in their own language a central affirmation  and that was some version of the golden rule   As you would that others would do unto you  do also unto them.  Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message. We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself. One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church      . Last night at Chagrin Fall  a newspaperman and a television guy said   That evening  when a service was held at the Riverside Church  we carried it on our station in this city. It was   he said   one of the most powerful moments of life together. We were all suffering. But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come  and you invited them. 'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated  when we have been despised and rejected.' And they all spoke out of their own traditions  a word about the healing power of solidarity  one with the other.  I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature  but I became a preacher. Now  as a preacher  I got a job. I got to preach the stuff  but I got to do it too. Or  as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks   Some people preach the Gospel. I have to tangibilitate the Gospel.  So  the real issue is  How do you tangibilitate compassion  How do you make it real  My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal  and challenged me when I fell beneath it. In my tradition  there is a gift that we have made to other traditions    to everybody around the world who knows the story of the  Good Samaritan.  Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity  random acts of kindness. But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly  you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable. The question was   What is the greatest commandment   And  according to Jesus  the word comes forth   You must love yourself  you must love the Lord your God with all your heart  mind and soul  and your neighbor as yourself.  And then the person asked   Well  what do you mean  'neighbor '  And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves  and how religious authorities went the other way  and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way  but an unsuspecting  despised person came along  saw the man in need  provided oil and wine for his wounds  put him on his own transportation  and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper   Take care of him.  And he said   Here  this is the initial investment  but if needs continue  make sure that you provide them. And whatever else is needed  I will provide it and pay for it when I return.  This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan. A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity  but one who provides a system of sustained care    I like that  'a system of sustained care '    in the inn  take care. I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary    that all God's children would have their needs cared for  so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks   In regards to health  are all the children in   And we could say yes. Oh  what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion. I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs  being concerned for housing  for healthcare  for the prisoners  for the infirm  for children    even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off  where they are going. To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs. But now  to be a Good Samaritan    and I always say  and to be a good American    for me  is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care. Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic. I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family  that family together that understands the nature of our unity. We are one people together. So  let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion  and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history. We would decide to establish this charter of compassion. The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history. It is the time that  biblically  we would speak of as the day  or the year  of God's favor. This is a season of grace. Unusual things are beginning to happen. Please pardon me  as a black man  for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor. And yet  there is so much more that needs to be done. We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens  all God's children  remembering mama eternal. Now  let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply  it usually takes the form of verse. And so I want to close with a little song. I close with this song    it's a children's song    because we are all children at the table of mama eternal. And if mama eternal has taught us correctly  this song will make sense  not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering  but to all who sign the charter for compassion. And this is why we do it. The song says     I made heaven so happy today      Receiving God's love and giving it away     When I looked up  heaven smiled at me     Now  I'm so happy. Can't you see      I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see      Sharing makes me happy  makes heaven happy too     I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see      Let me share my happy loving smile with you.   That's compassion.  Applause  I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view  and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion. The truth of the matter is otherwise. Our holy book  the Koran  consists of     chapters  and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala  the saying of  In the name of God  the all compassionate  the all merciful   or  as Sir Richard Burton    not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor  but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature    translates it.  In the name of God  the compassionating  the compassionate.  And in a saying of the Koran  which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity  God says to his prophet Muhammad    whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets  beginning with Adam  including Noah  including Moses  including Abraham  including Jesus Christ  and ending with Muhammad    that   We have not sent you  O Muhammad  except as a 'rahmah ' except as a source of compassion to humanity.  For us human beings  and certainly for us as Muslims  whose mission  and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet. And the prophet  in one of his sayings  said   Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God.  And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion    in fact  the Koran says that  God decreed upon himself compassion   or   reigned himself in by compassion     therefore  our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion  activators of compassion  actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion. That is all well and good  but where do we go wrong  and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world  For the answer to this  we turn to our spiritual path. In every religious tradition  there is the outer path and the inner path  or the exoteric path and the esoteric path. The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism  or  tasawwuf  in Arabic. And these doctors or these masters  these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition  refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies. In one of the battles that the prophet waged  he told his followers   We are returning from the lesser war to the greater war  to the greater battle.  And they said   Messenger of God  we are battle weary. How can we go to a greater battle   He said   That is the battle of the self  the battle of the ego.  The sources of human problems have to do with egotism   I.  The famous Sufi master Rumi  who is very well known to most of you  has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend  and he knocks on the door  and a voice answers   Who's there    It's me   or  more grammatically correctly   It is I   as we might say in English. The voice says   Go away.  After many years of training  of disciplining  of search and struggle  he comes back. With much greater humility  he knocks again on the door. The voice asks   Who is there   He said   It is you  O heartbreaker.  The door swings open  and the voice says   Come in  for there is no room in this house for two I's      two capital I's  not these eyes     for two egos.  And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path. In the presence of God  there is no room for more than one  I   and that is the  I  of divinity. In a teaching    called a  hadith qudsi  in our tradition    God says that   My servant   or  My creature  my human creature  does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to do.  And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean. You want your employees to do what you ask them to do  and if they've done that  then they can do extra. But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.  And   God says   my servant continues to get nearer to me  by doing more of what I've asked them to do     extra credit  we might call it     until I love him or love her. And when I love my servant   God says   I become the eyes by which he or she sees  the ears by which he or she listens  the hand by which he or she grasps  and the foot by which he or she walks  and the heart by which he or she understands.  It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions. Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism  the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path. When he says   I am the spirit  and I am the way   and when the prophet Muhammad said   Whoever has seen me has seen God   it is because they became so much an instrument of God  they became part of God's team    so that God's will was manifest through them  and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos. Compassion on earth is given  it is in us. All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way  get our egotism out of the way. I'm sure  probably all of you here  or certainly the very vast majority of you  have had what you might call a spiritual experience  a moment in your lives when  for a few seconds  a minute perhaps  the boundaries of your ego dissolved. And at that minute  you felt at one with the universe    one with that jug of water  one with every human being  one with the Creator    and you felt you were in the presence of power  of awe  of the deepest love  the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives. That is a moment which is a gift of God to us    a gift when  for a moment  he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on  I  I  I  me  me  me   and instead  like the person in Rumi's story  we say   Oh  this is all you. This is all you. And this is all us. And us  and I  and us are all part of you. O  Creator  O  the Objective  The source of our being and the end of our journey  you are also the breaker of our hearts. You are the one whom we should all be towards  for whose purpose we live  and for whose purpose we shall die  and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings.  Our message today  and our purpose today  and those of you who are here today  and the purpose of this charter of compassion  is to remind. For the Koran always urges us to remember  to remind each other  because the knowledge of truth is within every human being. We know it all. We have access to it all. Jung may have called it  the subconscious.  Through our subconscious  in your dreams    the Koran calls our state of sleep  the lesser death    the temporary death     in our state of sleep we have dreams  we have visions  we travel even outside of our bodies  for many of us  and we see wonderful things. We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it  and beyond the limitations of time as we know it. But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating  the compassionate. God  Bokh  whatever name you want to call him with  Allah  Ram  Om  whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity  it is the locus of absolute being  absolute love and mercy and compassion  and absolute knowledge and wisdom  what Hindus call  satchidananda.  The language differs  but the objective is the same. Rumi has another story about three men  a Turk  an Arab and    and I forget the third person  but for my sake  it could be a Malay. One is asking for angur    one is  say  an Englishman    one is asking for eneb  and one is asking for grapes. And they have a fight and an argument because     I want grapes.   I want eneb.  I want angur.     not knowing that the word that they're using refers to the same reality in different languages. There's only one absolute reality by definition  one absolute being by definition  because absolute is  by definition  single  and absolute and singular. There's this absolute concentration of being  the absolute concentration of consciousness  awareness  an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity. And these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human. For what defines humanity  perhaps biologically  is our physiology  but God defines humanity by our spirituality  by our nature. And the Koran says  He speaks to the angels and says   When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay  and breathed into him of my spirit  then  fall in prostration to him.  The angels prostrate  not before the human body  but before the human soul. Why  Because the soul  the human soul  embodies a piece of the divine breath  a piece of the divine soul. This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image. What is the imagery of God  The imagery of God is absolute being  absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love. And therefore  for us to be human    in the greatest sense of what it means to be human  in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human    means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us  and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being  of being alive  of beingness  the attribute of wisdom  of consciousness  of awareness  and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings. This is what I understand from my faith tradition  and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions  and this is the common platform on which we must all stand  and when we stand on this platform as such  I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world. And I believe  personally  that we're on the verge and that  with the presence and help of people like you here  we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah. For he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore. We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option  we must  we must lower our egos  control our egos    whether it is individual ego  personal ego  family ego  national ego    and let all be for the glorification of the one. Thank you  and God bless you. I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement  just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the   th century also agrees with us  and also calls us to this action. He said   A human being is a part of the whole  called by us  the 'universe '    a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself  his thoughts and feelings  as something separated from the rest  a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us  restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion  to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology  wherein compassion     karuna   it is called    is defined as   the sensitivity to another's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering.  It pairs closely with love  which is the will for the other to be happy  which requires  of course  that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self centeredness and selfishness to compassion  the concern for others  and  further  it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self concern suffer helplessly  while the compassionate are more free and  implicitly  more happy. The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend. It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair. Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute  most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others  even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings. In fact  suffering is so huge and enormous  his own becomes less and less monumental. And he begins to move beyond his self concern into the broader concern for others. And this immediately cheers him up  as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion. Thus  he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion. He is a very good colleague of Einstein's  we must say. Now  I want to tell a story  which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition  of the great Saint Asanga who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine. And Asanga lived     years after the Buddha's time. And he was discontented with the state of people's practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time. And so he said   I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine. They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment  but they are acting selfish and pathetic. So  Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum. I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now  but exists currently in a certain heaven     that's Maitreya     so  I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me  and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today.  So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya. And he left in disgust. And as he was leaving  he saw a man    a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain. And he had a lump of iron. And he was rubbing it with a cloth. And he became interested in that. He said   Well what are you doing   And the man said   I'm making a needle.  And he said   That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth.  And the man said   Really   And he showed him a dish full of needles. So he said   Okay  I get the point.  He went back to his cave. He meditated again. Another three years  no vision. He leaves again. This time  he comes down. And as he's leaving  he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge. And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff  its feathers brushes the rock    and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds. So he said   All right. I get the point.  He went back. Another three years. Again  no vision of Maitreya after nine years. And he again leaves  and this time  water dripping  making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream. And so  again  he goes back. And after    years there is still no vision. And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision. And he comes to the town. He's a broken person. And there  in the town  he's approached by a dog who comes like this    one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries  even in America  I think  in some areas    and he's looking just terrible. And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic  and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog. And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore. Some of it is like gangrenous  and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible. He thinks   What can I do to fix up this dog  Well  at least I can clean this wound and wash it.  So  he takes it to some water. He's about to clean  but then his awareness focuses on the maggots. And he sees the maggots  and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute. And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.  Well  if I clean the dog  I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be  That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha  no Maitreya  and everything is all hopeless. And now I'm going to kill the maggots   So  he had a brilliant idea. And he took a shard of something  and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh  and he placed it on ground. He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA. He was just immediately caught with the situation. So he thought   I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh  then clean the dog's wounds  and then I'll figure out what to do with the maggots.  So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots. Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab  these maggots. So he says   Well  I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh. And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue     the dog is kind of used up     and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing.  So he goes down  and he's sticking his tongue out like this. And he had to close his eyes  it's so disgusting  and the smell and everything. And then  suddenly  there's a pfft  a noise like that. He jumps back and there  of course  is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision    rainbow lights  golden  jeweled  a plasma body  an exquisite mystic vision    that he sees. And he says   Oh.  He bows. But  being human  he's immediately thinking of his next complaint. So as he comes up from his first bow he says   My Lord  I'm so happy to see you  but where have you been for    years  What is this   And Maitreya says   I was with you. Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you  mister dense    Looking for the Buddha in person   he said. And he said   You didn't have  until this moment  real compassion. And  until you have real compassion  you cannot recognize love.   Maitreya  means love   the loving one   in Sanskrit. And so he looked very dubious  Asanga did. And he said   If you don't believe me  just take me with you.  And so he took the Maitreya    it shrunk into a globe  a ball    took him on his shoulder. And he ran into town in the marketplace  and he said   Rejoice  Rejoice  The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is.  And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him    it wasn't Chautauqua  it was some other town    because they saw a demented looking  scrawny looking yogi man  like some kind of hippie  with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder  shouting that the future Buddha had come. So  naturally  they chased him out of town. But on the edge of town  one elderly lady  a charwoman in the charnel ground  saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog  but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya  and she offered a flower. So that encouraged him  and he went with Maitreya. Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven  which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds. And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years  dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion. And then I thought I would share with you what that method is  or one of them. A famous one  it's called the  Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion.  And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one    even animals too  but everyone is in human form. The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human. And then  among them  you think of your friends and loved ones  the circle at the table. And you think of your enemies  and you think of the neutral ones. And then you try to say   Well  the loved ones I love. But  you know  after all  they're nice to me. I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly. I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight. So  in a way  I like them so much because they're nice to me. While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine. And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me. But they are nice to somebody. I could be them.  And then the Buddhists  of course  think that  because we've all had infinite previous lives  we've all been each other's relatives  actually. Therefore all of you  in the Buddhist view  in some previous life  although you don't remember it and neither do I  have been my mother    for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you. And also  actually  I've been your mother. I've been female  and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life  the way the Buddhists reflect. So  my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother. You gave me that expression   the eternal mama   you said. That's wonderful. So  that's the way the Buddhists do it. A theist Christian can think that all beings  even my enemies  are God's children. So  in that sense  we're related. So  they first create this foundation of equality. So  we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love    just in the meditation    and we open our mind to those we don't know. And we definitely reduce the hostility and the  I don't want to be compassionate to them  to the ones we think of as the bad guys  the ones we hate and we don't like. And we don't hate anyone  therefore. So we equalize. That's very important. And then the next thing we do is what is called  mother recognition.  And that is  we think of every being as familiar  as family. We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama  and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation. And we see the mother in every being. We see that look that the mother has on her face  looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body  being a mammal  where she has true compassion  truly is the other  and identifies completely. Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life. And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism. The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings  in spiritual traditions. And so  we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings. People laugh at me because  you know  I used to say that I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom  when  of course  I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq. I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form. He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms. And you think of him as nursing you. And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem  but you think of him as a mom. And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you  and you see how they could be familiar to you. And you do that for a while  until you really feel that. You can feel the familiarity of all beings. Nobody seems alien. They're not  other.  You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings. Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general  if you can remember the kindness of your own mother  if you can remember the kindness of your spouse  or  if you are a mother yourself  how you were with your children. And you begin to get very sentimental  you cultivate sentimentality intensely. You will even weep  perhaps  with gratitude and kindness. And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility. Every being  even the most mean looking ones  can be motherly. And then  third  you step from there to what is called  a feeling of gratitude.  You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you. And then the fourth step  you go to what is called  lovely love.  In each one of these you can take some weeks  or months  or days depending on how you do it  or you can do them in a run  this meditation. And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy  when they are satisfied. And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness. Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry  they look ugly  every being  but when they're happy they look beautiful. And so you see beings in their potential happiness. And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy  even the enemy. We think Jesus is being unrealistic when he says   Love thine enemy.  He does say that  and we think he's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin.  Nice for him to say it  but I can't do that.  But  actually  that's practical. If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy. If your enemy was really happy  why would they bother to be your enemy  How boring to run around chasing you. They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time. So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy  because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble. But anyway  that's the  lovely love.   And then finally  the fifth step is compassion   universal compassion.  And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of. And you look at them  and you see how they are. And you realize how unhappy they are actually  mostly  most of the time. You see that furrowed brow in people. And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves. They're driven by this duty and this obligation.  I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something.  And they're rushing around all stressed out. And they think of it as somehow macho  hard discipline on themselves. But actually they are cruel to themselves. And  of course  they are cruel and ruthless toward others. And they  then  never get any positive feedback. And the more they succeed and the more power they have  the more unhappy they are. And this is where you feel real compassion for them. And you then feel you must act. And the choice of the action  of course  hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga  who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation  and whoever was in front of him  he wanted to help. But  of course  that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots. And I'm sure he did that later.  Laughter  But that just indicates the state of mind  you know. And so the next step    the sixth step beyond  universal compassion     is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way  and you have compassion for yourself also  and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something. Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways. And in Buddhism  they catch it in the future life. Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever. And materialism  they think they get out of it just by not existing  by dying  but they don't. And so they get reborn as whatever  you know. Never mind. I won't get into that. But the next step is called  universal responsibility.  And that is very important    the Charter of Compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion  what is called  universal responsibility.  In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama that he always teaches everywhere  he says that that is the common religion of humanity  kindness. But  kindness  means  universal responsibility.  And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us  we are responsible for that  and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it. We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it. And then  finally  that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy. One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable. Compassion makes you happy. The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself  even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else. Although  the change in your mind already does something for other beings  they can sense this new quality in yourself  and it helps them already  and gives them an example. And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over. So  practice compassion  read the charter  disseminate it and develop it within yourself. Don't just think   Well  I'm compassionate   or  I'm not compassionate   and sort of think you're stuck there. You can develop this. You can diminish the non compassion  the cruelty  the callousness  the neglect of others  and take universal responsibility for them. And then  not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile  but Karen Armstrong will smile. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective. I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule. So  I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language  and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk. I want to warn you about that. So  I do want to say  at the outset  that I think compassion's great. The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both. And I think it's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths. At the same time  I think religions don't deserve all the credit. I think nature gave them a helping hand here. I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are  in a certain sense  built into human nature. But I'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature  you realize that just affirming compassion  and affirming the golden rule  is really not enough. There's a lot of work to be done after that. OK so  a quick natural history  first of compassion. In the beginning  there was compassion  and I mean not just when human beings first showed up  but actually even before that. I think it's probably the case that  in the human evolutionary lineage  even before there were homo sapiens  feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool  and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened. It happened through a principle known as kin selection. And the basic idea of kin selection is that  if an animal feels compassion for a close relative  and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative  then  in the end  the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself. So  from a biologist's point of view  compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself. OK. I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy. I'll get there    I hope to get a little fuzzier. This doesn't bother me so much  that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self serving at the genetic level. Actually  I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family. That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural. The bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family. Now  there's more good news that came along later in evolution  a second kind of evolutionary logic. Biologists call that  reciprocal altruism.  OK. And there  the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor. Again  I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past  but from a biologist's point of view  this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self serving too. It's not that people think that  when they feel the compassion. It's not consciously self serving  but to a biologist  that's the logic. And so  you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies. I'm sure a lot of you  if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them  you feel really bad. But if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of  you can probably live with that. That's just human nature. So  it's another good news bad news story. It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic. The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself. So  there's still work to be done. Now  there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism  which I think is kind of good news  which is that the way that this is played out in the human species  it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule. I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes  but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions  no exposure to ethical philosophy  and you'll find  if you spend time with these people  that  basically  they believe that one good turn deserves another  and that bad deeds should be punished. And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes. So  they do understand that if you want to be treated well  you treat other people well. And it's good to treat other people well. That's close to being a kind of built in intuition. So  that's good news. Now  if you've been paying attention  you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here  we still aren't to universal love  and it's true because  although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural  it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule. I mean  for example  none of us  probably  want to go to prison  but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right  So  we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated. Now  we have a rationale for that. We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison. None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion. We have the capacity to carve out exceptions  put people in a special category. And the problem is that    although in the case of sending people to prison  you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule    that in everyday life  the way we all make these decisions about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to  is we use a much rougher and readier formula. Basically it's just like  if you're my enemy  if you're my rival    if you're not my friend  if you're not in my family    I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you. We all do that  and you see it all over the world. You see it in the Middle East  people who  from Gaza  are firing missiles at Israel. They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them  but they say   Well  but the Israelis  or some of them have done things that put them in a special category.  The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them  but they impose one on Gaza  and they say   Well  the Palestinians  or some of them  have brought this on themselves.  So  it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble. And it's natural to do that. So  the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not  by itself  going to bring us universal love. It's not going to save the world. Now  there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay. Are you on the edges of your seats here  Good  because before I tell you about that good news  I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain. So  I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world. It's this non zero sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about. It's just a quick introduction to game theory. This won't hurt. Okay. It's about zero sum and non zero sum games. If you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies  the technical answer is a non zero sum situation. And if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies  it's a zero sum situation. So  what do those terms mean  Basically  a zero sum game is the kind you're used to in sports  where there's a winner and a loser. So  their fortunes add up to zero. So  in tennis  every point is either good for you and bad for the other person  or good for them  bad for you. Either way  your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero sum game. Now  if you're playing doubles  then the person on your side of the net is in a non zero sum relationship with you  because every point is either good for both of you    positive  win win    or bad for both of you  it's lose lose. That's a non zero sum game. And in real life  there are lots of non zero sum games. In the realm of economics  say  if you buy something  that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money  but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise. You both feel you've won. In a war  two allies are playing a non zero sum game. It's going to either be win win or lose lose for them. So  there are lots of non zero sum games in real life. And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier  about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed  by just saying  well  compassion most naturally flows along non zero sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win win situation with some of their friends or allies. The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non zero sum channels. So  kind of webs of non zero sumness are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic. With zero sum channels you would expect something else. Okay. So  now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world. And now I can admit that it might not too  now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff. But it may. And the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non zero sumness  these webs that can be these channels for compassion. You can go back all the way to the stone age  technological evolution    roads  the wheel  writing  a lot of transportation and communication technologies    has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non zero sum relationships with more and more people at greater and greater distances. That's the story of civilization. It's why social organization has grown from the hunter gatherer village to the ancient state  the empire  and now here we are in a globalized world. And the story of globalization is largely a story of non zero sumness. You've probably heard the term  interdependence  applied to the modern world. Well  that's just another term for non zero sum. If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody  then you live in a non zero sum relationship with them. And you see this all the time in the modern world. You saw it with the recent economic crash  where bad things happen in the economy    bad for everybody  for much of the world. Good things happen  and it's good for much of the world. And  you know  I'm happy to say  I think there's really evidence that this non zero sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass. I mean  if you look at the American attitudes toward Japanese during World War II    look at the depictions of Japanese in the American media as just about subhuman  and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs  really without giving it much of a thought    and you compare that to the attitude now  I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence. Any form of interdependence  or non zero sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people. So  I think that's good. And the world is full of non zero sum dynamics. Environmental problems  in many ways  put us all in the same boat. And there are non zero sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of. For example  probably a lot of American Christians don't think of themselves as being in a non zero sum relationship with Muslims halfway around the world  but they really are  because if these Muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it  that's good for Americans  because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten American security. If they get less and less happy  that will be bad for Americans. So  there's plenty of non zero sumness. And so  the question is  If there's so much non zero sumness  why has the world not yet been suffused in love  peace  and understanding  The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk. Certainly  a couple of things are that  first of all  there are a lot of zero sum situations in the world. And also  sometimes people don't recognize the non zero sum dynamics in the world. In both of these areas  I think politicians can play a role. This isn't only about religion. I think politicians can help foster non zero sum relationships  Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on  in this regard. And politicians can be aware  and should be aware that  when people around the world are looking at them  are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a zero sum or a non zero sum relationship with a nation    like  say  America  or any other nation    human psychology is such that they use cues like  Do we feel we're being respected  Because  you know  historically  if you're not being respected  you're probably not going to wind up in a non zero sum  mutually profitable relationship with people. So  we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out. And some of this  again  is in the realm of political work. If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do  politicians  religious leaders  and us  it would be what I call  expanding the moral imagination     that is to say  your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances. This is not the same as compassion  but it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion. And I'm afraid we have another good news bad news story  which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature. That's good  but again we tend to deploy it selectively. Once we define somebody as an enemy  we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes  just naturally. So  if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American  somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag  and you see them on TV. Well  the average American is going to resist the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person. And if you tell them   Well  they think America disrespects them and even wants to dominate them  and they hate America. Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly   You know  they'll resist that comparison and that's natural  that's human. And  similarly  the person in Iran  when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil  they'll have trouble with that. So  it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it doesn't naturally go. I think it's worth the trouble because  again  it just helps us to understand. If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags  it helps to understand what makes them do it. And I think it's good moral exercise. I would say here is where religious leaders come in  because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people  at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think. I mean  religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business. It's their great calling right now  to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations  appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat. I would just sum up the way things look  at least from this secular perspective  as far as compassion and the golden rule go  by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature. It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed. And it's going to take real work to change that. But  nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.
