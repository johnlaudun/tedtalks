Let me tell you a story. It goes back     million years. It's a story of the neocortex  which means  new rind.  So in these early mammals  because only mammals have a neocortex  rodent like creatures. It was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin  and was a thin covering around their walnut sized brain  but it was capable of a new type of thinking. Rather than the fixed behaviors that non mammalian animals have  it could invent new behaviors. So a mouse is escaping a predator  its path is blocked  it'll try to invent a new solution. That may work  it may not  but if it does  it will remember that and have a new behavior  and that can actually spread virally through the rest of the community. Another mouse watching this could say   Hey  that was pretty clever  going around that rock   and it could adopt a new behavior as well. Non mammalian animals couldn't do any of those things. They had fixed behaviors. Now they could learn a new behavior but not in the course of one lifetime. In the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes  it could evolve a new fixed behavior. That was perfectly okay     million years ago. The environment changed very slowly. It could take        years for there to be a significant environmental change  and during that period of time it would evolve a new behavior. Now that went along fine  but then something happened. Sixty five million years ago  there was a sudden  violent change to the environment. We call it the Cretaceous extinction event. That's when the dinosaurs went extinct  that's when    percent of the animal and plant species went extinct  and that's when mammals overtook their ecological niche  and to anthropomorphize  biological evolution said   Hmm  this neocortex is pretty good stuff   and it began to grow it. And mammals got bigger  their brains got bigger at an even faster pace  and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area. If you took the human neocortex and stretched it out  it's about the size of a table napkin  and it's still a thin structure. It's about the thickness of a table napkin. But it has so many convolutions and ridges it's now    percent of our brain  and that's where we do our thinking  and it's the great sublimator. We still have that old brain that provides our basic drives and motivations  but I may have a drive for conquest  and that'll be sublimated by the neocortex into writing a poem or inventing an app or giving a TED Talk  and it's really the neocortex that's where the action is. Fifty years ago  I wrote a paper describing how I thought the brain worked  and I described it as a series of modules. Each module could do things with a pattern. It could learn a pattern. It could remember a pattern. It could implement a pattern. And these modules were organized in hierarchies  and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking. And there was actually very little to go on    years ago. It led me to meet President Johnson. I've been thinking about this for    years  and a year and a half ago I came out with the book  How To Create A Mind   which has the same thesis  but now there's a plethora of evidence. The amount of data we're getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year. Spatial resolution of brainscanning of all types is doubling every year. We can now see inside a living brain and see individual interneural connections connecting in real time  firing in real time. We can see your brain create your thoughts. We can see your thoughts create your brain  which is really key to how it works. So let me describe briefly how it works. I've actually counted these modules. We have about     million of them  and we create them in these hierarchies. I'll give you a simple example. I've got a bunch of modules that can recognize the crossbar to a capital A  and that's all they care about. A beautiful song can play  a pretty girl could walk by  they don't care  but they see a crossbar to a capital A  they get very excited and they say  crossbar   and they put out a high probability on their output axon. That goes to the next level  and these layers are organized in conceptual levels. Each is more abstract than the next one  so the next one might say  capital A.  That goes up to a higher level that might say  Apple.  Information flows down also. If the apple recognizer has seen A P P L  it'll think to itself   Hmm  I think an E is probably likely   and it'll send a signal down to all the E recognizers saying   Be on the lookout for an E  I think one might be coming.  The E recognizers will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing  could be an E. Ordinarily you wouldn't think so  but we're expecting an E  it's good enough  and yeah  I've seen an E  and then apple says   Yeah  I've seen an Apple.  Go up another five levels  and you're now at a pretty high level of this hierarchy  and stretch down into the different senses  and you may have a module that sees a certain fabric  hears a certain voice quality  smells a certain perfume  and will say   My wife has entered the room.  Go up another    levels  and now you're at a very high level. You're probably in the frontal cortex  and you'll have modules that say   That was ironic. That's funny. She's pretty.  You might think that those are more sophisticated  but actually what's more complicated is the hierarchy beneath them. There was a    year old girl  she had brain surgery  and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her. You can do that because there's no pain receptors in the brain. And whenever they stimulated particular  very small points on her neocortex  shown here in red  she would laugh. So at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex  but no  they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor  and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points.  You guys are so funny just standing around   was the typical comment  and they weren't funny  not while doing surgery. So how are we doing today  Well  computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex. I actually described the algorithm  which is similar to something called a hierarchical hidden Markov model  something I've worked on since the '  s.  Jeopardy  is a very broad natural language game  and Watson got a higher score than the best two players combined. It got this query correct   A long  tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping   and it quickly responded   What is a meringue harangue   And Jennings and the other guy didn't get that. It's a pretty sophisticated example of computers actually understanding human language  and it actually got its knowledge by reading Wikipedia and several other encyclopedias. Five to    years from now  search engines will actually be based on not just looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding  reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web and in books. So you'll be walking along  and Google will pop up and say   You know  Mary  you expressed concern to me a month ago that your glutathione supplement wasn't getting past the blood brain barrier. Well  new research just came out    seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione. Let me summarize it for you.  Twenty years from now  we'll have nanobots  because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology. They'll go into our brain through the capillaries and basically connect our neocortex to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud providing an extension of our neocortex. Now today  I mean  you have a computer in your phone  but if you need        computers for a few seconds to do a complex search  you can access that for a second or two in the cloud. In the     s  if you need some extra neocortex  you'll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain. So I'm walking along and I say   Oh  there's Chris Anderson. He's coming my way. I'd better think of something clever to say. I've got three seconds. My     million modules in my neocortex isn't going to cut it. I need a billion more.  I'll be able to access that in the cloud. And our thinking  then  will be a hybrid of biological and non biological thinking  but the non biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns. It will grow exponentially. And remember what happens the last time we expanded our neocortex  That was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads. Other primates have a slanted brow. They don't have the frontal cortex. But the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different. It's a quantitative expansion of neocortex  but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap and invent language and art and science and technology and TED conferences. No other species has done that. And so  over the next few decades  we're going to do it again. We're going to again expand our neocortex  only this time we won't be limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure. It'll be expanded without limit. That additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology. Thank you very much. At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we're going to become  and then when we become those people  we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made. So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get. Middle aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry. Older adults work hard to lose what middle aged adults worked hard to gain. On and on and on. The question is  as a psychologist  that fascinates me is  why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret  Now  I think one of the reasons    I'll try to convince you today   is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time. Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan  that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year. But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl  Is it teenage years  Is it middle age  Is it old age  The answer  it turns out  for most people  is now  wherever now happens to be. What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion  an illusion that history  our personal history  has just come to an end  that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives. Let me give you some data to back up that claim. So here's a study of change in people's personal values over time. Here's three values. Everybody here holds all of them  but you probably know that as you grow  as you age  the balance of these values shifts. So how does it do so  Well  we asked thousands of people. We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next    years  and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last    years. And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis  because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people  say     years old  to the reports of people who were     and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan. Here's what we found. First of all  you are right  change does slow down as we age  but second  you're wrong  because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think. At every age  from    to    in our data set  people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next    years. We call this the  end of history  illusion. To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect  you can connect these two lines  and what you see here is that    year olds anticipate changing only as much as    year olds actually do. Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things. For example  personality. Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality  neuroticism  openness to experience  agreeableness  extraversion  and conscientiousness. Again  we asked people how much they expected to change over the next    years  and also how much they had changed over the last    years  and what we found  well  you're going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over  because once again the rate of change does slow as we age  but at every age  people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade. And it isn't just ephemeral things like values and personality. You can ask people about their likes and dislikes  their basic preferences. For example  name your best friend  your favorite kind of vacation  what's your favorite hobby  what's your favorite kind of music. People can name these things. We ask half of them to tell us   Do you think that that will change over the next    years   and half of them to tell us   Did that change over the last    years   And what we find  well  you've seen it twice now  and here it is again  people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they'll have in    years  the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they'll enjoy in    years  and yet  people who are    years older all say   Eh  you know  that's really changed.  Does any of this matter  Is this just a form of mis prediction that doesn't have consequences  No  it matters quite a bit  and I'll give you an example of why. It bedevils our decision making in important ways. Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician    years ago. I put mine up on the screen to help you along. Now we asked people to predict for us  to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert    years from now  and on average  people said they would pay     dollars for that ticket. And yet  when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite    years ago perform today  they say only    dollars. Now  in a perfectly rational world  these should be the same number  but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability. Why does this happen  We're not entirely sure  but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining. Most of us can remember who we were    years ago  but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be  and then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine  it's not likely to happen. Sorry  when people say  I can't imagine that   they're usually talking about their own lack of imagination  and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they're describing. The bottom line is  time is a powerful force. It transforms our preferences. It reshapes our values. It alters our personalities. We seem to appreciate this fact  but only in retrospect. Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade. It's as if  for most of us  the present is a magic time. It's a watershed on the timeline. It's the moment at which we finally become ourselves. Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished. The person you are right now is as transient  as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been. The one constant in our life is change. Thank you. I read poetry all the time and write about it frequently and take poems apart to see how they work because I'm a word person. I understand the world best  most fully  in words rather than  say  pictures or numbers  and when I have a new experience or a new feeling  I'm a little frustrated until I can try to put it into words. I think I've always been that way. I devoured science fiction as a child. I still do. And I found poems by Andrew Marvell and Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson and William Butler Yeats because they were quoted in science fiction  and I loved their sounds and I went on to read about ottava rima and medial caesuras and enjambment and all that other technical stuff that you care about if you already care about poems  because poems already made me happier and sadder and more alive. And I became a poetry critic because I wanted to know how and why. Now  poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose any more than music or computer programming serve one purpose. The greek word poem  it just means  a made thing   and poetry is a set of techniques  ways of making patterns that put emotions into words. The more techniques you know  the more things you can make  and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love. That said  poetry does seem to be especially good at certain things. For example  we are all going to die. Poetry can help us live with that. Poems are made of words  nothing but words. The particulars in poems are like the particularities  the personalities  that distinguish people from one another. Poems are easy to share  easy to pass on  and when you read a poem  you can imagine someone's speaking to you or for you  maybe even someone far away or someone made up or someone deceased. That's why we can go to poems when we want to remember something or someone  to celebrate or to look beyond death or to say goodbye  and that's one reason poems can seem important  even to people who aren't me  who don't so much live in a world of words. The poet Frank O'Hara said   If you don't need poetry  bully for you   but he also said when he didn't want to be alive anymore  the thought that he wouldn't write any more poems had stopped him. Poetry helps me want to be alive  and I want to show you why by showing you how  how a couple of poems react to the fact that we're alive in one place at one time in one culture  and in another we won't be alive at all. So here's one of the first poems I memorized. It could address a child or an adult.  From far  from eve and morning From yon twelve winded sky  The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither  here am I. Now   for a breath I tarry Nor yet disperse apart   Take my hand quick and tell me  What have you in your heart. Speak now  and I will answer  How shall I help you  say  Ere to the wind's twelve quarters I take my endless way.   A. E. Housman  Now  this poem has appealed to science fiction writers. It's furnished at least three science fiction titles  I think because it says poems can brings us news from the future or the past or across the world  because their patterns can seem to tell you what's in somebody's heart. It says poems can bring people together temporarily  which I think is true  and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes but for how it rhymes  cleanly and simply on the two and four   say  and  way   with anticipatory hints on the one and three   answer  and  quarters   as if the poem itself were coming together. It plays up the fact that we die by exaggerating the speed of our lives. A few years on Earth become one speech  one breath. It's a poem about loneliness    the  I  in the poem feels no connection will last   and it might look like a plea for help 'til you get to the word  help   where this  I  facing you  taking your hand  is more like a teacher or a genie  or at least that's what he wants to believe. It would not be the first time a poet had written the poem that he wanted to hear. Now  this next poem really changed what I liked and what I read and what I felt I could read as an adult. It might not make any sense to you if you haven't seen it before.  The Garden   Oleander  coral from lipstick ads in the   's. Fruit of the tree of such knowledge To smack  thin air  meaning kiss or hit. It appears in the guise of outworn usages because we are bad  Big masculine threat  insinuating and slangy.   Rae Armantrout  Now  I found this poem in an anthology of almost equally confusing poems in     . I just heard that there were these scandalous writers called Language poets who didn't make any sense  and I wanted to go and see for myself what they were like  and some of them didn't do much for me  but this writer  Rae Armantrout  did an awful lot  and I kept reading her until I felt I knew what was going on  as I do with this poem. It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall and the Biblical story of the Fall  in which sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time. It's also about how appearances deceive  how our culture can sweep us along into doing and saying things we didn't intend or don't like  and Armantrout's style is trying to help us stop or slow down.  Smack  can mean  kiss  as in air kisses  as in lip smacking  but that can lead to  smack  as in  hit  as in domestic abuse  because sexual attraction can seem threatening. The red that means fertility can also mean poison. Oleander is poisonous. And outworn usages like  smack  for  kiss  or  hit  can help us see how our unacknowledged assumptions can make us believe we are bad  either because sex is sinful or because we tolerate so much sexism. We let guys tell women what to do. The poem reacts to old lipstick ads  and its edginess about statement  its reversals and halts  have everything to do with resisting the language of ads that want to tell us so easily what to want  what to do  what to think. That resistance is a lot of the point of the poem  which shows me  Armantrout shows me what it's like to hear grave threats and mortal dishonesty in the language of everyday life  and once she's done that  I think she can show other people  women and men  what it's like to feel that way and say to other people  women and men who feel so alienated or so threatened that they're not alone. Now  how do I know that I'm right about this somewhat confusing poem  Well in this case  I emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said   Yeah  yeah  that's about it.  Yeah.  Laughter   Applause  But usually  you can't know. You never know. You can't be sure  and that's okay. All we can do we is listen to poems and look at poems and guess and see if they can bring us what we need  and if you're wrong about some part of a poem  nothing bad will happen. Now  this next poem is older than Armantrout's  but a little younger than A. E. Housman's.  The Brave Man   The sun  that brave man  Comes through boughs that lie in wait  That brave man. Green and gloomy eyes In dark forms of the grass Run away. The good stars  Pale helms and spiky spurs  Run away. Fears of my bed  Fears of life and fears of death  Run away. That brave man comes up From below and walks without meditation  That brave man.   Wallace Stevens  Now  the sun in this poem  in Wallace Stevens' poem  seems so grave because the person in the poem is so afraid. The sun comes up in the morning through branches  dispels the dew  the eyes  on the grass  and defeats stars envisioned as armies.  Brave  has its old sense of showy as well as its modern sense  courage. This sun is not afraid to show his face. But the person in the poem is afraid. He might have been up all night. That is the reveal Stevens saves for that fourth stanza  where run away has become a refrain. This person might want to run away too  but fortified by the sun's example  he might just rise. Stevens saves that sonically odd word  meditation  for the end. Unlike the sun  human beings think. We meditate on past and future  life and death  above and below. And it can make us afraid. Poems  the patterns in poems  show us not just what somebody thought or what someone did or what happened but what it was like to be a person like that  to be so anxious  so lonely  so inquisitive  so goofy  so preposterous  so brave. That's why poems can seem at once so durable  so personal  and so ephemeral  like something inside and outside you at once. The Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry to a needle  a sliver of outside I cradle inside  and the American poet Terrance Hayes wrote six poems called  Wind in a Box.  One of them asks   Tell me  what am I going to do when I'm dead   And the answer is that he'll stay with us or won't stay with us inside us as wind  as air  as words. It is easier than ever to find poems that might stay inside you  that might stay with you  from long  long ago  or from right this minute  from far away or from right close to where you live  almost no matter where you live. Poems can help you say  help you show how you're feeling  but they can also introduce you to feelings  ways of being in the world  people  very much unlike you  maybe even people from long  long ago. Some poems even tell you that that is what they can do. That's what John Keats is doing in his most mysterious  perhaps  poem. It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished  he probably left it unfinished  and because it might be meant for a character in a play  but it might just be Keats' thinking about what his own writing  his handwriting  could do  and in it I hear  at least I hear  mortality  and I hear the power of older poetic techniques  and I have the feeling  you might have the feeling  of meeting even for an instant  almost becoming  someone else from long ago  someone quite memorable.  This living hand  now warm and capable Of earnest grasping  would  if it were cold And in the icy silence of the tomb  So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood So in my veins red life might stream again  And thou be conscience calm d    see here it is    I hold it towards you.  Thanks. Even nature's most disgusting creatures have important secrets  but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them  Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably  cockroaches can self stabilize running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them  or give them a perturbation like an earthquake  we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can go over complex terrain like grass  no problem  and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where  because of their shape  they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass. Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered. The animals rapidly invert and disappear in less than     milliseconds   you never see them   using the same structures that they use to run  their legs. They can run upside down very rapidly on rods  branches and wires  and if you perturb one of those branches  they can do this. They can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet. And they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access to a variety of different areas. They have wings for flying when they get warm  but they use those same wings to flip over if they get destabilized. Very effective. Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail safe. This is the foot of a cockroach. It has spines  gluey pads and claws  but if you take off those feet  they can still go over rough terrain  like the bottom video that you see  without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary. They can run up mesh without their feet. Here's an animal using a normal  alternating tripod  three legs  three legs  three legs  but in nature  the insects often have lost their legs. Here's one moving with two middle legs gone. It can even lose three legs  in a tripod  and adopt a new gait  a hopping gait. And I point out that all of these videos are slowed down    times  so they're actually really fast  when you see this. Robust systems are also damage resistant. Here's an animal climbing up a wall. It looks like a rapid  smooth  vertical climb  but when you slow it down  you see something very different. Here's what they do. They intentionally have a head on collision with the wall so they don't slow down and can transition up it in    milliseconds. And they can do this in part because they have extraordinary exoskeletons. And they're really just made up of compliant joints that are tubes and plates connected to one another. Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach. You see these plates  and you see the compliant membrane. My engineering colleague at Berkeley designed with his students a novel manufacturing technique where you essentially origami the exoskeleton  you laser cut it  laminate it  and you fold it up into a robot. And you can do that now in less than    minutes. These robots  called DASH  for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod  are highly compliant robots  and they're remarkably robust as a result of these features. They're certainly incredibly damage resistant. They even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches. So they can use their smart  compliant body to transition up a wall in a very simple way. They even have some of the beginnings of the rapid inversion behavior where they disappear. Now we want to know why they can go anywhere. We discovered that they can go through three millimeter gaps  the height of two pennies  two stacked pennies  and when they do this  they can actually run through those confined spaces at high speeds  although you never see it. To understand it better  we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton and showed that they can compress their body by over    percent. We put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis and showed that they can withstand forces     times their body weight  and after this they can fly and run absolutely normally. So you never know where curiosity based research will lead  and someday you may want a swarm of cockroach inspired robots to come at you. Thank you. Election night      was a night that tore me in half. It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.  One hundred and forty three   years after the end of slavery  and      years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act  an African American was elected president. Many of us never thought that this was possible until the moment that it happened. And in many ways  it was the climax of the black civil rights movement in the United States. I was in California that night  which was ground zero at the time for another movement  the marriage equality movement. Gay marriage was on the ballot in the form of Proposition    and as the election returns started to come in  it became clear that the right for same sex couples to marry  which had recently been granted by the California courts  was going to be taken away. So on the same night that Barack Obama won his historic presidency  the lesbian and gay community suffered one of our most painful defeats. And then it got even worse. Pretty much immediately  African Americans started to be blamed for the passage of Proposition  . This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said that blacks had voted for the measure by something like    percent. This turned out not to be true  but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in  and was grabbed on by the media. I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage. I listened to some gay commentator say that the African American community was notoriously homophobic  and now that civil rights had been achieved for us  we wanted to take away other people's rights. There were even reports of racist epithets being thrown at some of the participants of the gay rights rallies that took place after the election. And on the other side  some African Americans dismissed or ignored homophobia that was indeed real in our community. And others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights  and once again  the sinking feeling that two minority groups of which I'm both a part of were competing with each other instead of supporting each other overwhelmed and  frankly  pissed me off. Now  I'm a documentary filmmaker  so after going through my pissed off stage and yelling at the television and radio  my next instinct was to make a movie. And what guided me in making this film was  how was this happening  How was it that the gay rights movement was being pitted against the civil rights movement  And this wasn't just an abstract question. I'm a beneficiary of both movements  so this was actually personal. But then something else happened after that election in     . The march towards gay equality accelerated at a pace that surprised and shocked everyone  and is still reshaping our laws and our policies  our institutions and our entire country. And so it started to become increasingly clear to me that this pitting of the two movements against each other actually didn't make sense  and that they were in fact much  much more interconnected  and that  in fact  some of the way that the gay rights movement has been able to make such incredible gains so quickly is that it's used some of the same tactics and strategies that were first laid down by the civil rights movement. Let's just look at a few of these strategies. First off  it's really interesting to see  to actually visually see  how quick the gay rights movement has made its gains  if you look at a few of the major events on a timeline of both freedom movements. Now  there are tons of milestones in the civil rights movement  but the first one we're going to start with is the      Montgomery bus boycott. This was a protest campaign against Montgomery  Alabama's segregation on their public transit system  and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person. The campaign lasted a year  and it galvanized the civil rights movement like nothing had before it. And I call this strategy the  I'm tired of your foot on my neck  strategy. So gays and lesbians have been in society since societies began  but up until the mid   th century  homosexual acts were still illegal in most states. So just    years after the Montgomery bus boycott  a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy. It's known as Stonewall  in       and it's where a group of LGBT patrons fought back against police beatings at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked three days of rioting. Incidentally  black and latino LGBT folks were at the forefront of this rebellion  and it's a really interesting example of the intersection of our struggles against racism  homophobia  gender identity and police brutality. After Stonewall happened  gay liberation groups sprang up all over the country  and the modern gay rights  movement as we know it took off. So the next moment to look at on the timeline is the      March on Washington. This was a seminal event in the civil rights movement and it's where African Americans called for both civil and economic justice. And it's of course where Martin Luther King delivered his famous  I have a dream  speech  but what's actually less known is that this march was organized by a man named Bayard Rustin. Bayard was an out gay man  and he's considered one of the most brilliant strategists of the civil rights movement. He later in his life became a fierce advocate of LGBT rights as well  and his life is testament to the intersection of the struggles. The March on Washington is one of the high points of the movement  and it's where there was a fervent belief that African Americans too could be a part of American democracy. I call this strategy the  We are visible and many in numbers  strategy. Some early gay activists were actually directly inspired by the march  and some had taken part. Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said   We marched with Martin Luther King  seven of us from the Mattachine Society     which was an early gay rights organization    and from that moment on  we had our own dream about a gay rights march of similar proportions.  Several years later  a series of marches took place  each one gaining the momentum of the gay freedom struggle. The first one was in       and the second one took place in     . The third one was held in     . Almost a million people showed up  and people were so energized and excited by what had taken place  they went back to their own communities and started their own political and social organizations  further increasing the visibility of the movement. The day of that march  October     was then declared National Coming Out Day  and is still celebrated all over the world. These marches set the groundwork for the historic changes that we see happening today in the United States. And lastly  the  Loving  strategy. The name speaks for itself. In       the Supreme Court ruled in Loving v. Virginia  and invalidated all laws that prohibited interracial marriage. This is considered one of the Supreme Court's landmark civil rights cases. In       President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act  known as DOMA  and that made the federal government only have to recognize marriages between a man and a woman. In United States v. Windsor  a    year old lesbian named Edith Windsor sued the federal government when she was forced to pay estate taxes on her deceased wife's property  something that heterosexual  couples don't have to do. And as the case wound its way through the lower courts  the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent. When it got to the Supreme Court in       the Supreme Court agreed  and DOMA was thrown out. It was incredible. But the gay marriage movement has been making gains for years now. To date     states have passed laws allowing marriage equality. It's become the de facto battle for gay equality  and it seems like daily  laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts  even in places like Texas and Utah  which no one saw coming. So a lot has changed since that night in      when I felt torn in half. I did go on to make that film. It's a documentary film  and it's called  The New Black   and it looks at how the African American community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the gay marriage movement and this fight over the meaning of civil rights. And I wanted to capture some of this incredible change that was happening  and as luck or politics would have it  another marriage battle started gearing up  this time in Maryland  where African Americans make up    percent of the electorate. So this tension between gay rights and civil rights started to bubble up once again  and I was lucky enough to capture how some people were making the connection between the movements this time. This is a clip of Karess Taylor Hughes and Samantha Masters  two characters in the film  as they hit the streets of Baltimore and try to convince potential voters. Okay  are you registered to vote  Man  No. Karess Taylor Hughes  Okay. How old are you  Man    . KTH      You gotta get registered to vote. We got to get you registered to vote. Man  I ain't voting on no gay shit. SM  Okay  why  What's up  Man  I ain't with that. SM  That's not cool. Man  What made you be gay  SM  So what made you be straight  So what made you be straight  Man    You can't answer that question.  Laughter  KSM  I used to not have the same rights as you  but I know that because a black man like yourself stood up for a woman like me  I know that I've got the same opportunities. So you  as a black man  have the opportunity to stand up for somebody else. Whether you're gay or not  these are your brothers and sisters out here  and they need you to represent. Man    Who is you to tell somebody who they can't have sex with  who they can't be with  They ain't got that power. Nobody has that power to say  you can't marry that young lady. Who has that power  Nobody. SM  But you know what  Our state has put the power in your hands  and so what we need you to do is vote for  you gonna vote for  . Man    I got you. SM  Vote for    okay  Man    I got you. KSM  All right  do y'all need community service hours  You do  All right  you can always volunteer with us to get community service hours. Y'all want to do that  We feed you. We bring you pizza. Yoruba Richen  Thank you. What's amazing to me about that clip that we just captured as we were filming is  it really shows how Karess understands the history of the civil rights movement  but she's not restricted by it. She doesn't just limit it to black people. She sees it as a blueprint for expanding rights to gays and lesbians. Maybe because she's younger  she's like     she's able to do this a little bit more easily  but the fact is that Maryland voters did pass that marriage equality amendment  and in fact it was the first time that marriage equality was directly voted on and passed by the voters. African Americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded. It was a complete turnaround from that night in      when Proposition   was passed. It was  and feels  monumental. We in the LGBT community have gone from being a pathologized and reviled and criminalized group to being seen as part of the great human quest for dignity and equality. We've gone from having to hide our sexuality in order to maintain our jobs and our families to literally getting a place at the table with the president and a shout out at his second inauguration. I just want to read what he said at that inauguration   We the people declare today that the most evident of truths  that all of us are created equal. It is the star that guides us still  just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.  Now we know that everything is not perfect  especially when you look at what's happening with the LGBT rights issue internationally  but it says something about how far we've come when our president puts the gay freedom struggle in the context of the other great freedom struggles of our time  the women's rights movement and the civil rights movement. His statement demonstrates not only the interconnectedness of those movements  but how each one borrowed and was inspired by the other. So just as Martin Luther King learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics of civil disobedience and nonviolence  which became a bedrock of the civil rights movement  the gay rights movement saw what worked in the civil rights movement  and they used some of those same strategies and tactics to make gains at an even quicker pace. Maybe one more other reason for the relative quick progress of the gay rights movement. Whereas a lot of us continue to still live in racially segregated spaces  LGBT folks  we are everywhere. We are in urban communities and rural communities  communities of color  immigrant communities  churches and mosques and synagogues. We are your mothers and brothers and sisters and sons. And when someone that you love or a family member comes out  it may be easier to support their quest for equality. And in fact  the gay rights movement asks us to support justice and equality from a space of love. That may be the biggest  greatest gift that the movement has given us. It calls on us to access that which is most universal and most intimate  a love of our brother and our sister and our neighbor. I just want to end with a quote by one of our greatest freedom fighters who's no longer with us  Nelson Mandela of South Africa. Nelson Mandela led South Africa after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid  and out of the ashes of that  legalized racial discrimination  he led South Africa to become the first country in the world to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation within its constitution. Mandela said   For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains  but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.  So as these movements continue on  and as freedom struggles around the world continue on  let's remember that not only are they interconnected  but they must support and enhance each other for us to be truly victorious. Thank you. I grew up in a very small country town in Victoria. I had a very normal  low key kind of upbringing. I went to school  I hung out with my friends  I fought with my younger sisters. It was all very normal. And when I was     a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community achievement award. And my parents said   Hm  that's really nice  but there's kind of one glaring problem with that. She hasn't actually achieved anything.   Laughter  And they were right  you know. I went to school  I got good marks  I had a very low key after school job in my mum's hairdressing salon  and I spent a lot of time watching  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  and  Dawson's Creek.  Yeah  I know. What a contradiction. But they were right  you know. I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all. I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation. Years later  I was on my second teaching round in a Melbourne high school  and I was about    minutes into a year    legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said   Hey miss  when are you going to start doing your speech   And I said   What speech   You know  I'd been talking them about defamation law for a good    minutes. And he said   You know  like  your motivational speaking. You know  when people in wheelchairs come to school  they usually say  like  inspirational stuff    It's usually in the big hall.  And that's when it dawned on me  This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration. We are not  to this kid    and it's not his fault  I mean  that's true for many of us. For lots of us  disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists. We're not real people. We are there to inspire. And in fact  I am sitting on this stage looking like I do in this wheelchair  and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire you. Right   Laughter  Yeah. Well  ladies and gentlemen  I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you dramatically. I am not here to inspire you. I am here to tell you that we have been lied to about disability. Yeah  we've been sold the lie that disability is a Bad Thing  capital B  capital T. It's a bad thing  and to live with a disability makes you exceptional. It's not a bad thing  and it doesn't make you exceptional. And in the past few years  we've been able to propagate this lie even further via social media. You may have seen images like this one   The only disability in life is a bad attitude.  Or this one   Your excuse is invalid.  Indeed. Or this one   Before you quit  try   These are just a couple of examples  but there are a lot of these images out there. You know  you might have seen the one  the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth. You might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs. And these images  there are lots of them out there  they are what we call inspiration porn. And I use the term porn deliberately  because they objectify one group of people for the benefit of another group of people. So in this case  we're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people. The purpose of these images is to inspire you  to motivate you  so that we can look at them and think   Well  however bad my life is  it could be worse. I could be that person.  But what if you are that person  I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational  and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile. They were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  Laughter  And it is objectifying. These images  those images objectify disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people. They are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren't so bad for you  to put your worries into perspective. And life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult. We do overcome some things. But the things that we're overcoming are not the things that you think they are. They are not things to do with our bodies. I use the term  disabled people  quite deliberately  because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability  which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses. So I have lived in this body a long time. I'm quite fond of it. It does the things that I need it to do  and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have  and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well. They're not doing anything out of the ordinary. They are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity. So is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do  to share those images  People  when they say   You're an inspiration   they mean it as a compliment. And I know why it happens. It's because of the lie  it's because we've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional. And it honestly doesn't. And I know what you're thinking. You know  I'm up here bagging out inspiration  and you're thinking   Jeez  Stella  aren't you inspired sometimes by some things   And the thing is  I am. I learn from other disabled people all the time. I'm learning not that I am luckier than them  though. I am learning that it's a genius idea to use a pair of barbecue tongs to pick up things that you dropped.  Laughter  I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery. Genius. We are learning from each others' strength and endurance  not against our bodies and our diagnoses  but against a world that exceptionalizes and objectifies us. I really think that this lie that we've been sold about disability is the greatest injustice. It makes life hard for us. And that quote   The only disability in life is a bad attitude   the reason that that's bullshit is because it's just not true  because of the social model of disability. No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp. Never.  Laughter   Applause  Smiling at a television screen isn't going to make closed captions appear for people who are deaf. No amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop and radiating a positive attitude is going to turn all those books into braille. It's just not going to happen. I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception  but the norm. I want to live in a world where a    year old girl sitting in her bedroom watching  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  isn't referred to as achieving anything because she's doing it sitting down. I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning. I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people  and I want to live in a world where a kid in year    in a Melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user. Disability doesn't make you exceptional  but questioning what you think you know about it does. Thank you. Four years ago  a security researcher  or  as most people would call it  a hacker  found a way to literally make ATMs throw money at him. His name was Barnaby Jack  and this technique was later called  jackpotting  in his honor. I'm here today because I think we actually need hackers. Barnaby Jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or James Bond villain with his knowledge  but he chose to show the world his research instead. He believed that sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution. And I feel the same way. That's why I'm here today. We are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have. They scare us. But the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all. So I am here today because I think we need hackers  and in fact  they just might be the immune system for the information age. Sometimes they make us sick  but they also find those hidden threats in our world  and they make us fix it. I knew that I might get hacked for giving this talk  so let me save you the effort. In true TED fashion  here is my most embarrassing picture. But it would be difficult for you to find me in it  because I'm the one who looks like a boy standing to the side. I was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team wouldn't let me join. This is who I was  but this is who I wanted to be  Angelina Jolie. She portrayed Acid Burn in the '   film  Hackers.  She was pretty and she could rollerblade  but being a hacker  that made her powerful. And I wanted to be just like her  so I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums. I remember one late night I found a bit of PHP code. I didn't really know what it did  but I copy pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password protected site like that. Open Sesame. It was a simple trick  and I was just a script kiddie back then  but to me  that trick  it felt like this  like I had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips. This is the rush of power that hackers feel. It's geeks just like me discovering they have access to superpower  one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect  but thankfully no radioactive spiders. But with great power comes great responsibility  and you all like to think that if we had such powers  we would only use them for good. But what if you could read your ex's emails  or add a couple zeros to your bank account. What would you do then  Indeed  many hackers do not resist those temptations  and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud  malware or plain old identity theft  which is a serious issue. But there are other hackers  hackers who just like to break things  and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world and make us fix it. This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle Lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office. He learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the Internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers  no password needed. He reported it to the company  of course  but they ignored his report. Perhaps they thought universal access was a feature  not a bug  until two months ago when a group of hackers used it to get into people's files. But they didn't steal anything. They left a note  Your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world. Here's what you should do to fix it. We hope we helped. By getting into people's files like that  yeah  they broke the law  but they also forced that company to fix their product. Making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure in the hacker community  and it is controversial  but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day. This is what Khalil did. Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank  and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook which he attempted to report through the company's bug bounty program. These are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code. Unfortunately  due to some miscommunications  his report was not acknowledged. Frustrated with the exchange  he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall. This got their attention  all right  and they fixed the bug  but because he hadn't reported it properly  he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries. Thankfully for Khalil  a group of hackers were watching out for him. In fact  they raised more than        dollars to reward him for this discovery  raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing. But I think there's a greater story here still. Even companies founded by hackers  like Facebook was  still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers. And so for more conservative organizations  it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it. But I think it's worth the effort  because the alternative  to blindly fight all hackers  is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge. These are things that will come back and bite you. It is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web  especially in times like this  like today even  as governments and corporates fight to control the Internet. I find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition  its last line of defense even  perhaps someone like Anonymous  the leading brand of global hacktivism. This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today  but six years ago they were not much more than an Internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and Internet trolling campaigns. Their moment of transformation was in early      when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites. This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers. It turns out  the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it  and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world  from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide  Australia. This proved that Anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets  and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world. Since then  they've gone after many targets. They've uncovered corruption  abuse. They've hacked popes and politicians  and I think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or even leak sensitive documents. I think that  like Robin Hood  they are in the business of redistribution  but what they are after isn't your money. It's not your documents. It's your attention. They grab the spotlight for causes they support  forcing us to take note  acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be. They have been called many names from criminals to terrorists  and I cannot justify their illegal means  but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all. The reality is  hackers can do a lot more than break things. They can bring people together. And if the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it  just watch what happens when you try to shut the Internet down. This took place in Egypt in January       and as President Hosni Mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo  he sent his personal troops down to Egypt's Internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country's connection to the world overnight. For a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented  and for hackers  it made it personal. Hackers like the Telecomix group were already active on the ground  helping Egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like Morse code and ham radio. It was high season for low tech  which the government couldn't block  but when the Net went completely down  Telecomix brought in the big guns. They found European service providers that still had    year old analog dial up access infrastructure. They opened up     of those lines for Egyptians to use  serving slow but sweet Internet connection for Egyptians. This worked. It worked so well  in fact  one guy even used it to download an episode of  How I Met Your Mother.  But while Egypt's future is still uncertain  when the same thing happened in Syria just one year later  Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines  and Anonymous  they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the Syrian military by defacing their website. But with this sort of power  it really depends on where you stand  because one man's hero can be another's villain  and so the Syrian Electronic Army is a pro Assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime. They've taken down multiple high profile targets in the past few years  including the Associated Press's Twitter account  in which they posted a message about an attack on the White House injuring President Obama. This tweet was fake  of course  but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index that day was most certainly not  and a lot of people lost a lot of money. This sort of thing is happening all over the world right now. In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula to Latin America  from Europe to the United States  hackers are a force for social  political and military influence. As individuals or in groups  volunteers or military conflicts  there are hackers everywhere. They come from all walks of life  ethnicities  ideologies and genders  I might add. They are now shaping the world's stage. Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the   st century. This is because access to information is a critical currency of power  one which governments would like to control  a thing they attempt to do by setting up all you can eat surveillance programs  a thing they need hackers for  by the way. And so the establishment has long had a love hate relationship when it comes to hackers  because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large. Two years ago  I saw General Keith Alexander. He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander  but instead of his four star general uniform  he was wearing jeans and a t shirt. This was at DEF CON  the world's largest hacker conference. Perhaps like me  General Alexander didn't see        criminals that day in Vegas. I think he saw untapped potential. In fact  he was there to give a hiring pitch.  In this room right here   he said   is the talent our nation needs.  Well  hackers in the back row replied   Then stop arresting us.  Indeed  for years  hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence  but in light of what we know now  who is more watchful of our online world  The rules of the game are not that clear anymore  but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data hoarding corporates on their own playing field. To me  that represents hope. For the past three decades  hackers have done a lot of things  but they have also impacted civil liberties  innovation and Internet freedom  so I think it's time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them  because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys  how can they be the heroes too  My years in the hacker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty about hackers  They just can't see something broken in the world and leave it be. They are compelled to either exploit it or try and change it  and so they find the vulnerable aspects in our rapidly changing world. They make us  they force us to fix things or demand something better  and I think we need them to do just that  because after all  it is not information that wants to be free  it's us. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Hack the planet  It was less than a year after September     and I was at the Chicago Tribune writing about shootings and murders  and it was leaving me feeling pretty dark and depressed. I had done some activism in college  so I decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing. I thought it would be a safe way to do something positive  but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever  and we were all arrested. Police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence. My charges were dismissed  but a few weeks later  two FBI agents knocked on my door  and they told me that unless I helped them by spying on protest groups  they would put me on a domestic terrorist list. I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch  but I was terrified  and when my fear subsided  I became obsessed with finding out how this happened  how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the FBI's number one domestic terrorism threat. A few years later  I was invited to testify before Congress about my reporting  and I told lawmakers that  while everybody is talking about going green  some people are risking their lives to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines. They're physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers' harpoons and the whales. These are everyday people  like these protesters in Italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing. And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular  so in       their opponents made up a new word  eco terrorist  to shift how we view them. They just made it up. Now these companies have backed new laws like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act  which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits. Now most people never even heard about this law  including members of Congress. Less than one percent were in the room when it passed the House. The rest were outside at a new memorial. They were praising Dr. King as his style of activism was branded as terrorism if done in the name of animals or the environment. Supporters say laws like this are needed for the extremists  the vandals  the arsonists  the radicals. But right now  companies like TransCanada are briefing police in presentations like this one about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters as terrorists. The FBI's training documents on eco terrorism are not about violence  they're about public relations. Today  in multiple countries  corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms. The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago  and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism. The first of these ag gag prosecutions  as they're called  was a young woman named Amy Meyer  and Amy saw a sick cow being moved by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse as she was on the public street. And Amy did what any of us would  She filmed it. When I found out about her story  I wrote about it  and within    hours  it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges. But apparently  even exposing stuff like that is a threat. Through the Freedom of Information Act  I learned that the counter terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one. They even included this nice little write up of my book. They described it as  compelling and well written.  Blurb on the next book  right  The point of all of this is to make us afraid  but as a journalist  I have an unwavering faith in the power of education. Our best weapon is sunlight. Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man is to prove he's a man and not a piano key. Over and over throughout history  people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent. It's time we strike a new note. Thank you. In the middle of my Ph.D.  I was hopelessly stuck. Every research direction that I tried led to a dead end. It seemed like my basic assumptions just stopped working. I felt like a pilot flying through the mist  and I lost all sense of direction. I stopped shaving. I couldn't get out of bed in the morning. I felt unworthy of stepping across the gates of the university  because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton or any other scientist whose results I had learned about  because in science  we just learn about the results  not the process. And so obviously  I couldn't be a scientist. But I had enough support and I made it through and discovered something new about nature. This is an amazing feeling of calmness  being the only person in the world who knows a new law of nature. And I started the second project in my Ph.D  and it happened again. I got stuck and I made it through. And I started thinking  maybe there's a pattern here. I asked the other graduate students  and they said   Yeah  that's exactly what happened to us  except nobody told us about it.  We'd all studied science as if it's a series of logical steps between question and answer  but doing research is nothing like that. At the same time  I was also studying to be an improvisation theater actor. So physics by day  and by night  laughing  jumping  singing  playing my guitar. Improvisation theater  just like science  goes into the unknown  because you have to make a scene onstage without a director  without a script  without having any idea what you'll portray or what the other characters will do. But unlike science  in improvisation theater  they tell you from day one what's going to happen to you when you get onstage. You're going to fail miserably. You're going to get stuck. And we would practice staying creative inside that stuck place. For example  we had an exercise where we all stood in a circle  and each person had to do the world's worst tap dance  and everybody else applauded and cheered you on  supporting you onstage. When I became a professor and had to guide my own students through their research projects  I realized again  I don't know what to do. I'd studied thousands of hours of physics  biology  chemistry  but not one hour  not one concept on how to mentor  how to guide someone to go together into the unknown  about motivation. So I turned to improvisation theater  and I told my students from day one what's going to happen when you start research  and this has to do with our mental schema of what research will be like. Because you see  whenever people do anything  for example if I want to touch this blackboard  my brain first builds up a schema  a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do before I even start moving my hand  and if I get blocked  if my schema doesn't match reality  that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance. That's why your schemas had better match reality. But if you believe the way science is taught  and if you believe textbooks  you're liable to have the following schema of research. If A is the question  and B is the answer  then research is a direct path. The problem is that if an experiment doesn't work  or a student gets depressed  it's perceived as something utterly wrong and causes tremendous stress. And that's why I teach my students a more realistic schema. Here's an example where things don't match your schema. So I teach my students a different schema. If A is the question  B is the answer  stay creative in the cloud  and you start going  and experiments don't work  experiments don't work  experiments don't work  experiments don't work  until you reach a place linked with negative emotions where it seems like your basic assumptions have stopped making sense  like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet. And I call this place the cloud. Now you can be lost in the cloud for a day  a week  a month  a year  a whole career  but sometimes  if you're lucky enough and you have enough support  you can see in the materials at hand  or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud  a new answer  C  and you decide to go for it. And experiments don't work  experiments don't work  but you get there  and then you tell everyone about it by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C  which is a great way to communicate  but as long as you don't forget the path that brought you there. Now this cloud is an inherent part of research  an inherent part of our craft  because the cloud stands guard at the boundary. It stands guard at the boundary between the known and the unknown  because in order to discover something truly new  at least one of your basic assumptions has to change  and that means that in science  we do something quite heroic. Every day  we try to bring ourselves to the boundary between the known and the unknown and face the cloud. Now notice that I put B in the land of the known  because we knew about it in the beginning  but C is always more interesting and more important than B. So B is essential in order to get going  but C is much more profound  and that's the amazing thing about resesarch. Now just knowing that word  the cloud  has been transformational in my research group  because students come to me and say   Uri  I'm in the cloud   and I say   Great  you must be feeling miserable.  But I'm kind of happy  because we might be close to the boundary between the known and the unknown  and we stand a chance of discovering something truly new  since the way our mind works  it's just knowing that the cloud is normal  it's essential  and in fact beautiful  we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society  and it detoxifies the feeling that something is deeply wrong with me. And as a mentor  I know what to do  which is to step up my support for the student  because research in psychology shows that if you're feeling fear and despair  your mind narrows down to very safe and conservative ways of thinking. If you'd like to explore the risky paths needed to get out of the cloud  you need other emotions    solidarity  support  hope   that come with your connection from somebody else  so like in improvisation theater  in science  it's best to walk into the unknown together. So knowing about the cloud  you also learn from improvisation theater a very effective way to have conversations inside the cloud. It's based on the central principle of improvisation theater  so here improvisation theater came to my help again. It's called saying  Yes  and  to the offers made by other actors. That means accepting the offers and building on them  saying   Yes  and.  For example  if one actor says   Here is a pool of water   and the other actor says   No  that's just a stage   the improvisation is over. It's dead  and everybody feels frustrated. That's called blocking. If you're not mindful of communications  scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking. Saying  Yes  and  sounds like this.  Here is a pool of water.   Yeah  let's jump in.   Look  there's a whale  Let's grab it by its tail. It's pulling us to the moon   So saying  Yes  and  bypasses our inner critic. We all have an inner critic that kind of guards what we say  so people don't think that we're obscene or crazy or unoriginal  and science is full of the fear of appearing unoriginal. Saying  Yes  and  bypasses the critic and unlocks hidden voices of creativity you didn't even know that you had  and they often carry the answer about the cloud. So you see  knowing about the cloud and about saying  Yes  and  made my lab very creative. Students started playing off of each others' ideas  and we made surprising discoveries in the interface between physics and biology. For example  we were stuck for a year trying to understand the intricate biochemical networks inside our cells  and we said   We are deeply in the cloud   and we had a playful conversation where my student Shai Shen Orr said   Let's just draw this on a piece of paper  this network   and instead of saying   But we've done that so many times and it doesn't work   I said   Yes  and let's use a very big piece of paper   and then Ron Milo said   Let's use a gigantic architect's blueprint kind of paper  and I know where to print it   and we printed out the network and looked at it  and that's where we made our most important discovery  that this complicated network is just made of a handful of simple  repeating interaction patterns like motifs in a stained glass window. We call them network motifs  and they're the elementary circuits that help us understand the logic of the way cells make decisions in all organisms  including our body. Soon enough  after this  I started being invited to give talks to thousands of scientists across the world  but the knowledge about the cloud and saying  Yes  and  just stayed within my own lab  because you see  in science  we don't talk about the process  anything subjective or emotional. We talk about the results. So there was no way to talk about it in conferences. That was unthinkable. And I saw scientists in other groups get stuck without even having a word to describe what they're seeing  and their ways of thinking narrowed down to very safe paths  their science didn't reach its full potential  and they were miserable. I thought  that's the way it is. I'll try to make my lab as creative as possible  and if everybody else does the same  science will eventually become more and more better and better. That way of thinking got turned on its head when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller give a talk about her experiences as a woman in science. And she asked   Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science  It's not by chance. It's a matter of values.  You see  science seeks knowledge that's objective and rational. That's the beautiful thing about science. But we also have a cultural myth that the doing of science  what we do every day to get that knowledge  is also only objective and rational  like Mr. Spock. And when you label something as objective and rational  automatically  the other side  the subjective and emotional  become labeled as non science or anti science or threatening to science  and we just don't talk about it. And when I heard that  that science has a culture  everything clicked into place for me  because if science has a culture  culture can be changed  and I can be a change agent working to change the culture of science wherever I could. And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference  I talked about my science  and then I talked about the importance of the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science and how we should talk about them  and I looked at the audience  and they were cold. They couldn't hear what I was saying in the context of a    back to back PowerPoint presentation conference. And I tried again and again  conference after conference  but I wasn't getting through. I was in the cloud. And eventually I managed to get out the cloud using improvisation and music. Since then  every conference I go to  I give a science talk and a second  special talk called  Love and fear in the lab   and I start it off by doing a song about scientists' greatest fear  which is that we work hard  we discover something new  and somebody else publishes it before we do. We call it being scooped  and being scooped feels horrible. It makes us afraid to talk to each other  which is no fun  because we came to science to share our ideas and to learn from each other  and so I do a blues song  which    Applause    called  Scooped Again   and I ask the audience to be my backup singers  and I tell them   Your text is 'Scoop  Scoop.'  It sounds like this   Scoop  scoop   Sounds like this.   I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop    And then we go for it.   I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      I've been scooped again     Scoop  Scoop      Oh mama  can't you feel my pain     Heavens help me  I've been scooped again   Thank you. Thank you for your backup singing. So everybody starts laughing  starts breathing  notices that there's other scientists around them with shared issues  and we start talking about the emotional and subjective things that go on in research. It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted. Finally  we can talk about this in a scientific conference. And scientists have gone on to form peer groups where they meet regularly and create a space to talk about the emotional and subjective things that happen as they're mentoring  as they're going into the unknown  and even started courses about the process of doing science  about going into the unknown together  and many other things. So my vision is that  just like every scientist knows the word  atom   that matter is made out of atoms  every scientist would know the words like  the cloud   saying  Yes  and   and science will become much more creative  make many  many more unexpected discoveries for the benefit of us all  and would also be much more playful. And what I might ask you to remember from this talk is that next time you face a problem you can't solve in work or in life  there's a word for what you're going to see  the cloud. And you can go through the cloud not alone but together with someone who is your source of support to say  Yes  and  to your ideas  to help you say  Yes  and  to your own ideas  to increase the chance that  through the wisps of the cloud  you'll find that moment of calmness where you get your first glimpse of your unexpected discovery  your C. Thank you. Six months ago  I got an email from a man in Israel who had read one of my books  and the email said   You don't know me  but I'm your   th cousin.  And it said   I have a family tree with        people on it  including you  Karl Marx  and several European aristocrats.  Now I did not know what to make of this. Part of me was like  okay  when's he going to ask me to wire        dollars to his Nigerian bank  right  I also thought         relatives  do I want that  I have enough trouble with some of the ones I have already. And I won't name names  but you know who you are. But another part of me said  this is remarkable. Here I am alone in my office  but I'm not alone at all. I'm connected to        people around the world  and that's four Madison Square Gardens full of cousins. And some of them are going to be great  and some of them are going to be irritating  but they're all related to me. So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy  which I always thought was a very staid and proper field  but it turns out it's going through a fascinating revolution  and a controversial one. Partly  this is because of DNA and genetic testing  but partly  it's because of the Internet. There are sites that now take the Wikipedia approach to family trees  collaboration and crowdsourcing  and what you do is  you load your family tree on  and then these sites search to see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree is the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree  and if it is  then you can combine  and then you combine and combine and combine until you get these massive  mega family trees with thousands of people on them  or even millions. I'm on something on Geni called the world family tree  which has no less than a jaw dropping    million people. So that's    million people connected by blood or marriage  sometimes both. It's in all seven continents  including Antarctica. I'm on it. Many of you are on it  whether you know it or not  and you can see the links. Here's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow. She has no idea I exist  but we are officially cousins. We have just    links between us. And there's my cousin Barack Obama. And he is my aunt's fifth great aunt's husband's father's wife's seventh great nephew  so practically my old brother. And my cousin  of course  the actor Kevin Bacon    who is my first cousin's twice removed's wife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's niece's husband. So six degrees of Kevin Bacon  plus or minus several degrees. Now  I'm not boasting  because all of you have famous people and historical figures in your tree  because we are all connected  and    million may seem like a lot  but in a few years  it's quite likely we will have a family tree with all  almost all  seven billion people on Earth. But does it really matter  What's the importance  And I do think it is important  and I'll give you five reasons why  really quickly. First  it's got scientific value. This is an unprecedented history of the human race  and it's giving us valuable data about how diseases are inherited  how people migrate  and there's a team of scientists at MIT right now studying the world family tree. Number two  it brings history alive. I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein  so I told my seven year old son that  and he was totally engaged. Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy with weird hair. He's Uncle Albert.  Laughter  And my son wanted to know   What did he say  What is E   MC squared   Also  it's not all good news. I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer  the serial killer  but I will say that's on my wife's side. So I want to make that clear. Sorry  honey. Number three  interconnectedness. We all come from the same ancestor  and you don't have to believe the literal Bible version  but scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam and mitochondrial Eve  and these were about         to         years ago. We all have a bit of their DNA in us. They are our great great great great great great    continue that for about       times    grandparents  and so that means we literally all are biological cousins as well  and estimates vary  but probably the farthest cousin you have on Earth is about a   th cousin. Now  it's not just ancestors we share  descendants. If you have kids  and they have kids  look how quickly the descendants accumulate. So in        generations  you're going to have thousands of offspring  and millions of offspring. Number four  a kinder world. Now  I know that there are family feuds. I have three sons  so I see how they fight. But I think that there's also a human bias to treat your family a little better than strangers. I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots  because they're going to have to realize that they are cousins with thousands of people in whatever ethnic group they happen to have issues with  and I think you look back at history  and a lot of the terrible things we've done to each other is because one group thinks another group is sub human  and you can't do that anymore. We're not just part of the same species. We're part of the same family. We share   .  percent of our DNA. Now the final one is number five  a democratizing effect. Some genealogy has an elitist strain  like people say   Oh  I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots and you're not  so you cannot join my country club.  But that's really going to be hard to do now  because everyone is related. I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots    by marriage  but still. So it's really a fascinating time in the history of family  because it's changing so fast. There is gay marriage and sperm donors and there's intermarriage on an unprecedented scale  and this makes some of my more conservative cousins a little nervous  but I actually think it's a good thing. I think the more inclusive the idea of family is  the better  because then you have more potential caretakers  and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed Hillary Clinton says    it takes a village. So I have all these hundreds and thousands  millions of new cousins. I thought  what can I do with this information  And that's when I decided  why not throw a party  So that's what I'm doing. And you're all invited. Next year  next summer  I will be hosting what I hope is the biggest and best family reunion in history. Thank you. I want you there. I want you there. It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science  which is a great venue  but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair  which is  I think  very appropriate  because I see this as a family reunion meets a world's fair. There's going to be exhibits and food  music. Paul McCartney is    steps away  so I'm hoping he brings his guitar. He hasn't RSVP'd yet  but fingers crossed. And there is going to be a day of speakers  of fascinating cousins. It's early  but I've already  I've got some lined up. Cass Sunstein  my cousin who is perhaps the most brilliant legal scholar  will be talking. He was a former member of the Obama administration. And on the other side of the political spectrum  George H.W. Bush  number     the father  he has agreed to participate  and Nick Kroll  the comedian  and Dr. Oz  and many more to come. And  of course  the most important is that you  I want you guys there  and I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org and figure out how you're on the family tree  because these are big issues  family and tribe  and I don't know all the answers  but I have a lot of smart relatives  including you guys  so together  I think we can figure it out. Only together can we solve these big problems. So from cousin to cousin  I thank you. I can't wait to see you. Goodbye. People say things about religion all the time. The late  great Christopher Hitchens wrote a book called  God Is Not Great  whose subtitle was   Religion Poisons Everything.  But last month  in Time magazine  Rabbi David Wolpe  who I gather is referred to as America's rabbi  said  to balance that against that negative characterization  that no important form of social change can be brought about except through organized religion. Now  remarks of this sort on the negative and the positive side are very old. I have one in my pocket here from the first century BCE by Lucretius  the author of  On the Nature of Things   who said   Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum     I should have been able to learn that by heart   which is  that's how much religion is able to persuade people to do evil  and he was talking about the fact of Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter Iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice in order to preserve the prospects of his army. So there have been these long debates over the centuries  in that case  actually  we can say over the millennia  about religion. People have talked about it a lot  and they've said good and bad and indifferent things about it. What I want to persuade you of today is of a very simple claim  which is that these debates are in a certain sense preposterous  because there is no such thing as religion about which to make these claims. There isn't a thing called religion  and so it can't be good or bad. It can't even be indifferent. And if you think about claims about the nonexistence of things  one obvious way to try and establish the nonexistence of a purported thing would be to offer a definition of that thing and then to see whether anything satisfied it. I'm going to start out on that little route to begin with. So if you look in the dictionaries and if you think about it  one very natural definition of religion is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings. As I say  this is in many dictionaries  but you'll also find it actually in the work of Sir Edward Tylor  who was the first professor of anthropology at Oxford  one of the first modern anthropologists. In his book on primitive culture  he says the heart of religion is what he called animism  that is  the belief in spiritual agency  belief in spirits. The first problem for that definition is from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called  Tuff.  There's a guy talking to a rabbi. The rabbi says he doesn't believe in God. The guy says   You're a rabbi  how can you not believe in God   And the reply is   It's what's so great about being Jewish. You don't have to believe in a God per se  just in being Jewish.   Laughter  So if this guy is a rabbi  and a Jewish rabbi  and if you have to believe in God in order to be religious  then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion that since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi without believing in God  Judaism isn't a religion. That seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought. Here's another argument against this view. A friend of mine  an Indian friend of mine  went to his grandfather when he was very young  a child  and said to him   I want to talk to you about religion   and his grandfather said   You're too young. Come back when you're a teenager.  So he came back when he was a teenager  and he said to his grandfather   It may be a bit late now because I've discovered that I don't believe in the gods.  And his grandfather  who was a wise man  said   Oh  so you belong to the atheist branch of the Hindu tradition.   Laughter  And finally  there's this guy  who famously doesn't believe in God. His name is the Dalai Lama. He often jokes that he's one of the world's leading atheists. But it's true  because the Dalai Lama's religion does not involve belief in God. Now you might think this just shows that I've given you the wrong definition and that I should come up with some other definition and test it against these cases and try and find something that captures atheistic Judaism  atheistic Hinduism  and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity  but I actually think that that's a bad idea  and the reason I think it's a bad idea is that I don't think that's how our concept of religion works. I think the way our concept of religion works is that we actually have  we have a list of paradigm religions and their sub parts  right  and if something new comes along that purports to be a religion  what we ask is   Well  is it like one of these   Right  And I think that's not only how we think about religion  and that's  as it were  so from our point of view  anything on that list had better be a religion  which is why I don't think an account of religion that excludes Buddhism and Judaism has a chance of being a good starter  because they're on our list. But why do we have such a list  What's going on  How did it come about that we have this list  I think the answer is a pretty simple one and therefore crude and contentious. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it  but here's my story  and true or not  it's a story that I think gives you a good sense of how the list might have come about  and therefore helps you to think about what use the list might be. I think the answer is  European travelers  starting roughly about the time of Columbus  started going around the world. They came from a Christian culture  and when they arrived in a new place  they noticed that some people didn't have Christianity  and so they asked themselves the following question  what have they got instead of Christianity  And that list was essentially constructed. It consists of the things that other people had instead of Christianity. Now there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way  which is that Christianity is extremely  even on that list  it's an extremely specific tradition. It has all kinds of things in it that are very  very particular that are the results of the specifics of Christian history  and one thing that's at the heart of it  one thing that's at the heart of most understandings of Christianity  which is the result of the specific history of Christianity  is that it's an extremely creedal religion. It's a religion in which people are really concerned about whether you believe the right things. The history of Christianity  the internal history of Christianity  is largely the history of people killing each other because they believed the wrong thing  and it's also involved in struggles with other religions  obviously starting in the Middle Ages  a struggle with Islam  in which  again  it was the infidelity  the fact that they didn't believe the right things  that seemed so offensive to the Christian world. Now that's a very specific and particular history that Christianity has  and not everywhere is everything that has ever been put on this sort of list like it. Here's another problem  I think. A very specific thing happened. It was actually adverted to earlier  but a very specific thing happened in the history of the kind of Christianity that we see around us mostly in the United States today  and it happened in the late   th century  and that specific thing that happened in the late   th century was a kind of deal that was cut between science  this new way of organizing intellectual authority  and religion. If you think about the   th century  say  if you think about intellectual life before the late   th century  anything you did  anything you thought about  whether it was the physical world  the human world  the natural world apart from the human world  or morality  anything you did would have been framed against the background of a set of assumptions that were religious  Christian assumptions. You couldn't give an account of the natural world that didn't say something about its relationship  for example  to the creation story in the Abrahamic tradition  the creation story in the first book of the Torah. So everything was framed in that way. But this changes in the late   th century  and for the first time  it's possible for people to develop serious intellectual careers as natural historians like Darwin. Darwin worried about the relationship between what he said and the truths of religion  but he could proceed  he could write books about his subject without having to say what the relationship was to the religious claims  and similarly  geologists increasingly could talk about it. In the early   th century  if you were a geologist and made a claim about the age of the Earth  you had to explain whether that was consistent or how it was or wasn't consistent with the age of the Earth implied by the account in Genesis. By the end of the   th century  you can just write a geology textbook in which you make arguments about how old the Earth is. So there's a big change  and that division  that intellectual division of labor occurs as I say  I think  and it sort of solidifies so that by the end of the   th century in Europe  there's a real intellectual division of labor  and you can do all sorts of serious things  including  increasingly  even philosophy  without being constrained by the thought   Well  what I have to say has to be consistent with the deep truths that are given to me by our religious tradition.  So imagine someone who's coming out of that world  that late   th century world  coming into the country that I grew up in  Ghana  the society that I grew up in  Asante  coming into that world at the turn of the   th century with this question that made the list  what have they got instead of Christianity  Well  here's one thing he would have noticed  and by the way  there was a  person who actually did this. His name was Captain Rattray  he was sent as the British government anthropologist  and he wrote a book about Asante religion. This is a soul disc. There are many of them in the British Museum. I could give you an interesting  different history of how it comes about that many of the things from my society ended up in the British Museum  but we don't have time for that. So this object is a soul disc. What is a soul disc  It was worn around the necks of the soul washers of the Asante king. What was their job  To wash the king's soul. It would take a long while to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing that could be washed  but Rattray knew that this was religion because souls were in play. And similarly  there were many other things  many other practices. For example  every time anybody had a drink  more or less  they poured a little bit on the ground in what's called the libation  and they gave some to the ancestors. My father did this. Every time he opened a bottle of whiskey  which I'm glad to say was very often  he would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground  and he would talk to  he would say to Akroma Ampim  the founder of our line  or Yao Antony  my great uncle  he would talk to them  offer them a little bit of this. And finally  there were these huge public ceremonials. This is an early   th century drawing by another British military officer of such a ceremonial  where the king was involved  and the king's job  one of the large parts of his job  apart from organizing warfare and things like that  was to look after the tombs of his ancestors  and when a king died  the stool that he sat on was blackened and put in the royal ancestral temple  and every    days  the King of Asante has to go and do cult for his ancestors. That's a large part of his job  and people think that if he doesn't do it  things will fall apart. So he's a religious figure  as Rattray would have said  as well as a political figure. So all this would count as religion for Rattray  but my point is that when you look into the lives of those people  you also find that every time they do anything  they're conscious of the ancestors. Every morning at breakfast  you can go outside the front of the house and make an offering to the god tree  the nyame dua outside your house  and again  you'll talk to the gods and the high gods and the low gods and the ancestors and so on. This is not a world in which the separation between religion and science has occurred. Religion has not being separated from any other areas of life  and in particular  what's crucial to understand about this world is that it's a world in which the job that science does for us is done by what Rattray is going to call religion  because if they want an explanation of something  if they want to know why the crop just failed  if they want to know why it's raining or not raining  if they need rain  if they want to know why their grandfather has died  they are going to appeal to the very same entities  the very same language  talk to the very same gods about that. This great separation  in other words  between religion and science hasn't happened. Now  this would be a mere historical curiosity  except that in large parts of the world  this is still the truth. I had the privilege of going to a wedding the other day in northern Namibia     miles or so south of the Angolan border in a village of     people. These were modern people. We had with us Oona Chaplin  who some of you may have heard of  and one of the people from this village came up to her  and said   I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'  So these were not people who were isolated from our world  but nevertheless  for them  the gods and the spirits are still very much there  and when we were on the bus going back and forth to the various parts of the  ceremony   they prayed not just in a generic way but for the safety of the journey  and they meant it  and when they said to me that my mother  the bridegroom's  grandmother   was with us  they didn't mean it figuratively. They meant  even though she was a dead person  they meant that she was still around. So in large parts of the world today  that separation between science and religion hasn't occurred in large parts of the world today  and as I say  these are not    This guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank. These are fellow citizens of the world with you  but they come from a place in which religion is occupying a very different role. So what I want you to think about next time somebody wants to make some vast generalization about religion is that maybe there isn't such a thing as a religion  such a thing as religion  and that therefore what they say cannot possibly be true. I need to start by telling you a little bit about my social life  which I know may not seem relevant  but it is. When people meet me at parties and they find out that I'm an English professor who specializes in language  they generally have one of two reactions. One set of people look frightened.  Laughter  They often say something like   Oh  I'd better be careful what I say. I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make.  And then they stop talking.  Laughter  And they wait for me to go away and talk to someone else. The other set of people  their eyes light up  and they say   You are just the person I want to talk to.  And then they tell me about whatever it is they think is going wrong with the English language. A couple of weeks ago  I was at a dinner party and the man to my right started telling me about all the ways that the Internet is degrading the English language. He brought up Facebook  and he said   To defriend  I mean  is that even a real word   I want to pause on that question  What makes a word real  My dinner companion and I both know what the verb  defriend  means  so when does a new word like  defriend  become real  Who has the authority to make those kinds of official decisions about words  anyway  Those are the questions I want to talk about today. I think most people  when they say a word isn't real  what they mean is  it doesn't appear in a standard dictionary. That  of course  raises a host of other questions  including  who writes dictionaries  Before I go any further  let me clarify my role in all of this. I do not write dictionaries. I do  however  collect new words much the way dictionary editors do  and the great thing about being a historian of the English language is that I get to call this  research.  When I teach the history of the English language  I require that students teach me two new slang words before I will begin class. Over the years  I have learned some great new slang this way  including  hangry   which    which is when you are cranky or angry because you are hungry  and  adorkable   which is when you are adorable in kind of a dorky way  clearly  terrific words that fill important gaps in the English language. But how real are they if we use them primarily as slang and they don't yet appear in a dictionary  With that  let's turn to dictionaries. I'm going to do this as a show of hands  How many of you still regularly refer to a dictionary  either print or online  Okay  so that looks like most of you. Now  a second question. Again  a show of hands  How many of you have ever looked to see who edited the dictionary you are using  Okay  many fewer. At some level  we know that there are human hands behind dictionaries  but we're really not sure who those hands belong to. I'm actually fascinated by this. Even the most critical people out there tend not to be very critical about dictionaries  not distinguishing among them and not asking a whole lot of questions about who edited them. Just think about the phrase  Look it up in the dictionary   which suggests that all dictionaries are exactly the same. Consider the library here on campus  where you go into the reading room  and there is a large  unabridged dictionary up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect lying open so we can go stand before it to get answers. Now  don't get me wrong  dictionaries are fantastic resources  but they are human and they are not timeless. I'm struck as a teacher that we tell students to critically question every text they read  every website they visit  except dictionaries  which we tend to treat as un authored  as if they came from nowhere to give us answers about what words really mean. Here's the thing  If you ask dictionary editors  what they'll tell you is they're just trying to keep up with us as we change the language. They're watching what we say and what we write and trying to figure out what's going to stick and what's not going to stick. They have to gamble  because they want to appear cutting edge and catch the words that are going to make it  such as LOL  but they don't want to appear faddish and include the words that aren't going to make it  and I think a word that they're watching right now is YOLO  you only live once. Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors  and you might be surprised by one of the places where we hang out. Every January  we go to the American Dialect Society annual meeting  where among other things  we vote on the word of the year. There are about     or     people who come  some of the best known linguists in the United States. To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting  it occurs right before happy hour. Anyone who comes can vote. The most important rule is that you can vote with only one hand. In the past  some of the winners have been  tweet  in      and  hashtag  in     .  Chad  was the word of the year in the year       because who knew what a chad was before       and  WMD  in     . Now  we have other categories in which we vote too  and my favorite category is most creative word of the year. Past winners in this category have included  recombobulation area   which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security  where you can recombobulate. You can put your belt back on  put your computer back in your bag. And then my all time favorite word at this vote  which is  multi slacking.  And multi slacking is the act of having multiple windows up on your screen so it looks like you're working when you're actually goofing around on the web. Will all of these words stick  Absolutely not. And we have made some questionable choices  for example in      when the word of the year was  Plutoed   to mean demoted. But some of the past winners now seem completely unremarkable  such as  app  and  e  as a prefix  and  google  as a verb. Now  a few weeks before our vote  Lake Superior State University issues its list of banished words for the year. What is striking about this is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap between their list and the list that we are considering for words of the year  and this is because we're noticing the same thing. We're noticing words that are coming into prominence. It's really a question of attitude. Are you bothered by language fads and language change  or do you find it fun  interesting  something worthy of study as part of a living language  The list by Lake Superior State University continues a fairly long tradition in English of complaints about new words. So here is Dean Henry Alford in       who was very concerned that  desirability  is really a terrible word. In       Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter to David Hume giving up the word  colonize  as bad. Over the years  we've also seen worries about new pronunciations. Here is Samuel Rogers in      who is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations that he finds offensive  and he says  as if contemplate were not bad enough  balcony makes me sick.  The word is borrowed in from Italian and it was pronounced bal COE nee. These complaints now strike us as quaint  if not downright adorkable     Laughter     but here's the thing  we still get quite worked up about language change. I have an entire file in my office of newspaper articles which express concern about illegitimate words that should not have been included in the dictionary  including  LOL  when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary and  defriend  when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary. I also have articles expressing concern about  invite  as a noun   impact  as a verb  because only teeth can be impacted  and  incentivize  is described as  boorish  bureaucratic misspeak.  Now  it's not that dictionary editors ignore these kinds of attitudes about language. They try to provide us some guidance about words that are considered slang or informal or offensive  often through usage labels  but they're in something of a bind  because they're trying to describe what we do  and they know that we often go to dictionaries to get information about how we should use a word well or appropriately. In response  the American Heritage Dictionaries include usage notes. Usage notes tend to occur with words that are troublesome in one way  and one of the ways that they can be troublesome is that they're changing meaning. Now usage notes involve very human decisions  and I think  as dictionary users  we're often not as aware of those human decisions as we should be. To show you what I mean  we'll look at an example  but before we do  I want to explain what the dictionary editors are trying to deal with in this usage note. Think about the word  peruse  and how you use that word. I would guess many of you are thinking of skim  scan  reading quickly. Some of you may even have some walking involved  because you're perusing grocery store shelves  or something like that. You might be surprised to learn that if you look in most standard dictionaries  the first definition will be to read carefully  or pore over. American Heritage has that as the first definition. They then have  as the second definition  skim  and next to that  they say  usage problem.  And then they include a usage note  which is worth looking at. So here's the usage note   Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'... But the word is often used more loosely  to mean simply 'to read.'... Further extension of the word to mean 'to glance over  skim ' has traditionally been considered an error  but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming somewhat more acceptable. When asked about the sentence  'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly '    percent of the  Usage  Panel found it unacceptable in          percent in       and    percent in     .  Ah  the Usage Panel  that trusted body of language authorities who is getting more lenient about this. Now  what I hope you're thinking right now is   Wait  who's on the Usage Panel  And what should I do with their pronouncements   If you look in the front matter of American Heritage Dictionaries  you can actually find the names of the people on the Usage Panel. But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries  There are about     people on the Usage Panel. They include academicians  journalists  creative writers. There's a Supreme Court justice on it and a few linguists. As of       the list includes me. Here's what we can do for you. We can give you a sense of the range of opinions about contested usage. That is and should be the extent of our authority. We are not a language academy. About once a year  I get a ballot that asks me about whether new uses  new pronunciations  new meanings  are acceptable. Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot. I listen to what other people are saying and writing. I do not listen to my own likes and dislikes about the English language. I will be honest with you  I do not like the word  impactful   but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether  impactful  is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written prose. So to be responsible  what I do is go look at usage  which often involves going to look at online databases such as Google Books. Well  if you look for  impactful  in Google Books  here is what you find. Well  it sure looks like  impactful  is proving useful for a certain number of writers  and has become more and more useful over the last    years. Now  there are going to be changes that all of us don't like in the language. There are going to be changes where you think   Really  Does the language have to change that way   What I'm saying is  we should be less quick to decide that that change is terrible  we should be less quick to impose our likes and dislikes about words on other people  and we should be entirely reluctant to think that the English language is in trouble. It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it. In retrospect  we think it's fascinating that the word  nice  used to mean silly  and that the word  decimate  used to mean to kill one in every   . We think that Ben Franklin was being silly to worry about  notice  as a verb. Well  you know what  We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years for worrying about  impact  as a verb and  invite  as a noun. The language is not going to change so fast that we can't keep up. Language just doesn't work that way. I hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome but fun and fascinating  just the way dictionary editors do. I hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually remaking our language and keeping it robust. So how does a word get into a dictionary  It gets in because we use it and we keep using it  and dictionary editors are paying attention to us. If you're thinking   But that lets all of us decide what words mean   I would say   Yes it does  and it always has.  Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource  but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what words mean. If a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means  it's real. That word might be slangy  that word might be informal  that word might be a word that you think is illogical or unnecessary  but that word that we're using  that word is real. Thank you. Think of a hard choice you'll face in the near future. It might be between two careers    artist and accountant    or places to live    the city or the country    or even between two people to marry    you could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita. Or it might be a choice about whether to have children  to have an ailing parent move in with you  to raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by but leaves you cold. Or whether to donate your life savings to charity. Chances are  the hard choice you thought of was something big  something momentous  something that matters to you. Hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing  hand wringing  the gnashing of teeth. But I think we've misunderstood hard choices and the role they play in our lives. Understanding hard choices uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses. What makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate. In any easy choice  one alternative is better than the other. In a hard choice  one alternative is better in some ways  the other alternative is better in other ways  and neither is better than the other overall. You agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country because staying is better in some ways  moving is better in others  and neither is better than the other overall. We shouldn't think that all hard choices are big. Let's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast. You could have high fiber bran cereal or a chocolate donut. Suppose what matters in the choice is tastiness and healthfulness. The cereal is better for you  the donut tastes way better  but neither is better than the other overall  a hard choice. Realizing that small choices can also be hard may make big hard choices seem less intractable. After all  we manage to figure  out what to have for breakfast  so maybe we can figure out whether to stay in the city or uproot for the new job in the country. We also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard because we are stupid. When I graduated from college  I couldn't decide between two careers  philosophy and law. I really loved philosophy. There are amazing things you can learn as a philosopher  and all from the comfort of an armchair. But I came from a modest immigrant family where my idea of luxury was having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich in my school lunchbox  so the thought of spending my whole life sitting around in armchairs just thinking  well  that struck me as the height  of extravagance and frivolity. So I got out my yellow pad  I drew a line down the middle  and I tried my best to think of the reasons for and against each alternative. I remember thinking to myself  if only I knew what my life in each career would be like. If only God or Netflix would send me a DVD of my two possible future careers  I'd be set. I'd compare them side by side  I'd see that one was better  and the choice would be easy. But I got no DVD  and because I couldn't figure out which was better  I did what many of us do in hard choices  I took the safest option. Fear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer  and as I discovered  lawyering didn't quite fit. It wasn't who I was. So now I'm a philosopher  and I study hard choices  and I can tell you that fear of the unknown  while a common motivational default in dealing with hard choices  rests on a misconception of them. It's a mistake to think that in hard choices  one alternative really is better than the other  but we're too stupid to know which  and since we don't know which  we might as well take the least risky option. Even taking two alternatives side by side with full information  a choice can still be hard. Hard choices are hard not because of us or our ignorance  they're hard because there is no best option. Now  if there's no best option  if the scales don't tip in favor of one alternative over another  then surely the alternatives must be equally good. So maybe the right thing to say in hard choices is that they're between equally good options. But that can't be right. If alternatives are equally good  you should just flip a coin between them  and it seems a mistake to think  here's how you should decide between careers  places to live  people to marry  Flip a coin. There's another reason for thinking that hard choices aren't choices between equally good options. Suppose you have a choice between two jobs  you could be an investment banker or a graphic artist. There are a variety of things that matter in such a choice  like the excitement of the work  achieving financial security  having time to raise a family  and so on. Maybe the artist's career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of pictorial expression. Maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of financial manipulation. Imagine the two jobs however you like so that neither is better than the other. Now suppose we improve one of them a bit. Suppose the bank  wooing you  adds     dollars a month to your salary. Does the extra money now make the banking job better than the artist one  Not necessarily. A higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before  but it might not be enough to make being a banker better than being an artist. But if an improvement in one of the jobs doesn't make it better than the other  then the two original jobs could not have been equally good. If you start with two things that are equally good  and you improve one of them  it now must be better than the other. That's not the case with options in hard choices. So now we've got a puzzle. We've got two jobs. Neither is better than the other  nor are they equally good. So how are we supposed to choose  Something seems to have gone wrong here. Maybe the choice itself is problematic and comparison is impossible. But that can't be right. It's not like we're trying to choose between two things that can't be compared. We're weighing the merits of two jobs  after all  not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs. A comparison of the overall merits of two jobs is something we can make  and one we often do make. I think the puzzle arises because of an unreflective assumption we make about value. We unwittingly assume that values like justice  beauty  kindness  are akin to scientific quantities  like length  mass and weight. Take any comparative question not involving value  such as which of two suitcases is heavier. There are only three possibilities. The weight of one is greater  lesser or equal to the weight of the other. Properties like weight can be represented by real numbers    one  two  three and so on    and there are only three possible comparisons between any two real numbers. One number is greater  lesser  or equal to the other. Not so with values. As post Enlightenment creatures  we tend to assume that scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world  but the world of value is different from the world of science. The stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers. The stuff of the other world can't. We shouldn't assume that the world of is  of lengths and weights  has the same structure as the world of ought  of what we should do. So if what matters to us    a child's delight  the love you have for your partner   can't be represented by real numbers  then there's no reason to believe that in choice  there are only three possibilities    that one alternative is better  worse or equal to the other. We need to introduce a new  fourth relation beyond being better  worse or equal  that describes what's going on in hard choices. I like to say that the alternatives are  on a par.  When alternatives are on a par  it may matter very much which you choose  but one alternative isn't better than the other. Rather  the alternatives are in the same neighborhood of value  in the same league of value  while at the same time being very different in kind of value. That's why the choice is hard. Understanding hard choices in this way uncovers something about ourselves we didn't know. Each of us has the power to create reasons. Imagine a world in which every choice you face is an easy choice  that is  there's always a best alternative. If there's a best alternative  then that's the one you should choose  because part of being rational is doing the better thing rather than the worse thing  choosing what you have most reason to choose. In such a world  we'd have most reason to wear black socks instead of pink socks  to eat cereal instead of donuts  to live in the city rather than the country  to marry Betty instead of Lolita. A world full of only easy choices would enslave us to reasons. When you think about it  it's nuts to believe that the reasons given to you dictated that you had most reason to pursue the exact hobbies you do  to live in the exact house you do  to work at the exact job you do. Instead  you faced alternatives that were on a par   hard choices   and you made reasons for yourself to choose that hobby  that house and that job. When alternatives are on a par  the reasons given to us  the ones that determine whether we're making a mistake  are silent as to what to do. It's here  in the space of hard choices  that we get to exercise our normative power  the power to create reasons for yourself  to make yourself into the kind of person for whom country living is preferable to the urban life. When we choose between options that are on a par  we can do something really rather remarkable. We can put our very selves behind an option. Here's where I stand. Here's who I am. I am for banking. I am for chocolate donuts. This response in hard choices is a rational response  but it's not dictated by reasons given to us. Rather  it's supported by reasons created by us. When we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that  we wholeheartedly become the people that we are. You might say that we become the authors of our own lives. So when we face hard choices  we shouldn't beat our head against a wall trying to figure out which alternative is better. There is no best alternative. Instead of looking for reasons out there  we should be looking for reasons in here  Who am I to be  You might decide to be a pink sock wearing  cereal loving  country living banker  and I might decide to be a black sock wearing  urban  donut loving artist. What we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us. Now  people who don't exercise their normative powers in hard choices are drifters. We all know people like that. I drifted into being a lawyer. I didn't put my agency behind lawyering. I wasn't for lawyering. Drifters allow the world to write the story of their lives. They let mechanisms of reward and punishment    pats on the head  fear  the easiness of an option   to determine what they do. So the lesson of hard choices  reflect on what you can put your agency behind  on what you can be for  and through hard choices  become that person. Far from being sources of agony and dread  hard choices are precious opportunities for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition  that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect sometimes run out  and it is here  in the space of hard choices  that we have the power to create reasons for ourselves to become the distinctive people that we are. And that's why hard choices are not a curse but a godsend. Thank you. Today  a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwells And announced that I'm  articulate  Which means that when it comes to enunciation and diction I don't even think of it  Cause I m  articulate  So when my professor asks a question And my answer is tainted with a connotation of urbanized suggestion There s no misdirected intention Pay attention  Cause I m  articulate  So when my father asks   Wha  kinda ting is dis   My  articulate  answer never goes amiss I say  father  this is the impending problem at hand  And when I m on the block I switch it up just because I can So when my boy says   What s good with you son   I just say   I jus  fall out wit dem people but I done   And sometimes in class I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask  Yo  Why dese books neva be about my peoples  Yes  I have decided to treat all three of my languages as equals Because I m  articulate  But who controls articulation  Because the English language is a multifaceted oration Subject to indefinite transformation Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English But I m here to tell you that even  articulate  Americans sound foolish to the British So when my Professor comes on the block and says   Hello  I stop him and say  Noooo   You re being inarticulate   the proper way is to say  what s good   Now you may think that s too hood  that s not cool But I m here to tell you that even our language has rules So when Mommy mocks me and says  ya ll be madd going to the store  I say  Mommy  no  that sentence is not following the law Never does the word  madd  go  before a present participle That s simply the principle of this English  If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every mountaintop  From every suburbia  and every hood  Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis Of this world saying  it is good  So I may not always come before you with excellency of speech But do not judge me by my language and assume That I m too ignorant to teach  Cause I speak three tongues One for each  Home  school and friends I m a tri lingual orator Sometimes I m consistent with my language now Then switch it up so I don t bore later Sometimes I fight back two tongues While I use the other one in the classroom And when I mistakenly mix them up I feel crazy like   I m cooking in the bathroom I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen But you can t expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is broken These words are spoken By someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this season And the reason I speak a composite version of your language Is because mines was raped away along with my history I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us That our current state is not a mystery I m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad So unless you ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad I m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity So don t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity As much as has been raped away from our people How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language As anything less than equal Let there be no confusion Let there be no hesitation This is not a promotion of ignorance This is a linguistic celebration That s why I put  tri lingual  on my last job application I can help to diversify your consumer market is all I wanted them to know And when they call me for the interview I ll be more than happy to show that I can say   What s good   Whatagwan  And of course   Hello  Because I m  articulate  Thank you. I don't know if you've noticed  but there's been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs. Do they think  do they feel and  if so  how  So this afternoon  in my limited time  I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that by introducing you to two dogs  both of whom have taken the command  speak  quite literally. The first dog is the first to go  and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner  and the title is  A Dog on His Master.   As young as I look  I am growing older faster than he. Seven to one is the ratio  they tend to say. Whatever the number  I will pass him one day and take the lead  the way I do on our walks in the woods  and if this ever manages to cross his mind  it would be the sweetest shadow I have ever cast on snow or grass.  Thank you. And our next dog speaks in something called the revenant  which means a spirit that comes back to visit you.  I am the dog you put to sleep  as you like to call the needle of oblivion  come back to tell you this simple thing  I never liked you.   When I licked your face  I thought of biting off your nose. When I watched you toweling yourself dry  I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap. I resented the way you moved  your lack of animal grace  the way you would sit in a chair to eat  a napkin on your lap  a knife in your hand. I would have run away but I was too weak  a trick you taught me while I was learning to sit and heel and  greatest of insults  shake hands without a hand. I admit the sight of the leash would excite me  but only because it meant I was about to smell things you had never touched. You do not want to believe this  but I have no reason to lie  I hated the car  hated the rubber toys  disliked your friends  and worse  your relatives. The jingling of my tags drove me mad. You always scratched me in the wrong place.   All I ever wanted from you was food and water in my bowls. While you slept  I watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky. It took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl. Now  I am free of the collar  free of the yellow raincoat  monogrammed sweater  the absurdity of your lawn  and that is all you need to know about this place  except what you already supposed and are glad it did not happen sooner  that everyone here can read and write  the dogs in poetry  the cats and all the others in prose.  Thank you. Twenty three years ago  at the age of     I shot and killed a man. I was a young drug dealer with a quick temper and a semi automatic pistol. But that wasn't the end of my story. In fact  it was beginning  and the    years since is a story of acknowledgment  apology and atonement. But it didn't happen in the way that you might imagine or think. These things occurred in my life in a way that was surprising  especially to me. See  like many of you  growing up  I was an honor roll student  a scholarship student  with dreams of becoming a doctor. But things went dramatically wrong when my parents separated and eventually divorced. The actual events are pretty straightforward. At the age of     I got shot three times standing on the corner of my block in Detroit. My friend rushed me to the hospital. Doctors pulled the bullets out  patched me up  and sent me back to the same  neighborhood where I got shot. Throughout this ordeal  no one hugged me  no one counseled me  no one told me I would be okay. No one told me that I would live in fear  that I would become paranoid  or that I would react hyper violently to being shot. No one told me that one day  I would become the person behind the trigger. Fourteen months later  at   a.m.  I fired the shots that caused a man's death. When I entered prison  I was bitter  I was angry  I was hurt. I didn't want to take responsibility. I blamed everybody from my parents to the system. I rationalized my decision to shoot because in the hood where I come from  it's better to be the shooter than the person getting shot. As I sat in my cold cell  I felt helpless  unloved and abandoned. I felt like nobody cared  and I reacted with hostility to my confinement. And I found myself getting deeper and deeper into trouble. I ran black market stores  I loan sharked  and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled into the prison. I had in fact become what the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called  the worst of the worst.  And because of my activity  I landed in solitary confinement for seven and a half years out of my incarceration. Now as I see it  solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places you can find yourself  but find myself I did. One day  I was pacing my cell  when an officer came and delivered mail. I looked at a couple of letters before I looked at the letter that had my son's squiggly handwriting on it. And anytime I would get a letter from my son  it was like a ray of light in the darkest place you can imagine. And on this particular day  I opened this letter  and in capital letters  he wrote   My mama told me why you was in prison  murder.  He said   Dad  don't kill. Jesus watches what you do. Pray to Him.  Now  I wasn't religious at that time  nor am I religious now  but it was something so profound about my son's words. They made me examine things about my life that I hadn't considered. It was the first time in my life that I had actually thought about the fact that my son would see me as a murderer. I sat back on my bunk and I reflected on something I had read in  Plato   where Socrates stated in  Apology  that the unexamined life isn't worth living. At that point is when the transformation began. But it didn't come easy. One of the things I realized  which was part of the transformation  was that there were four key things. The first thing was  I had great mentors. Now  I know some of you all are probably thinking  how did you find a great mentor in prison  But in my case  some of my mentors who are serving life sentences were some of the best people to ever come into my life  because they forced me to look at my life honestly  and they forced me to challenge myself about my decision making. The second thing was literature. Prior to going to prison  I didn't know that there were so many brilliant black poets  authors and philosophers  and then I had the great fortune of encountering Malcolm X's autobiography  and it shattered every stereotype I had about myself. The third thing was family. For    years  my father stood by my side with an unshakable faith  because he believed that I had what it took to turn my life around. I also met an amazing woman who is now the mother of my two year old son Sekou  and she taught me how to love myself in a healthy way. The final thing was writing. When I got that letter from my son  I began to write a journal about things I had experienced in my childhood and in prison  and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement. Earlier in my incarceration  I had received a letter from one of the relatives of my victim  and in that letter  she told me she forgave me  because she realized I was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships and just made a series of poor decisions. It was the first time in my life that I ever felt open to forgiving myself. One of the things that happened after that experience is that I thought about the other men who were incarcerated alongside of me  and how much I wanted to share this with them. And so I started talking to them about some of their experiences  and I was devastated to realize that most of them came from the same abusive environments  And most of them wanted help and they wanted to turn it around  but unfortunately the system that currently holds  .  million people in prison is designed to warehouse as opposed to rehabilitate or transform. So I made it up in my mind that if I was ever released from prison that I would do everything in my power to help change that. In       I walked out of prison for the first time after two decades. Now imagine  if you will  Fred Flintstone walking into an episode of  The Jetsons.  That was pretty much what my life was like. For the first time  I was exposed to the Internet  social media  cars that talk like KITT from  Knight Rider.  But the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology. See  when I went to prison  our car phones were this big and required two people to carry them. So imagine what it was like when I first grabbed my little Blackberry and I started learning how to text. But the thing is  the people around me  they didn't realize that I had no idea what all these abbreviated texts meant  like LOL  OMG  LMAO  until one day I was having a conversation with one of my friends via text  and I asked him to do something  and he responded back   K.  And I was like   What is K   And he was like   K is okay.  So in my head  I was like   Well what the hell is wrong with K   And so I text him a question mark. And he said   K   okay.  And so I tap back   FU.   Laughter  And then he texts back  and he asks me why was I cussing him out. And I said   LOL FU   as in  I finally understand. And so fast forward three years  I'm doing relatively good. I have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab  I work for an amazing company called BMe  I teach at the University of Michigan  but it's been a struggle because I realize that there are more men and women coming home who are not going to be afforded those opportunities. I've been blessed to work with some amazing men and women  helping others reenter society  and one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans. He served    years for a crime he didn't commit. He's    years old. He's currently enrolled in college. And one of the things that we talked about is the three things that I found important in my personal transformation  the first being acknowledgment. I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others. I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt. The second thing was apologizing. I had to apologize to the people I had hurt. Even though I had no expectations of them accepting it  it was important to do because it was the right thing. But I also had to apologize to myself. The third thing was atoning. For me  atoning meant going back into my community and working with at risk youth who were on the same path  but also becoming at one with myself. Through my experience of being locked up  one of the things I discovered is this  the majority of men and women who are incarcerated are redeemable  and the fact is     percent of the men and women who are incarcerated will at some point return to the community  and we have a role in determining what kind of men and women return to our community. My wish today is that we will embrace a more empathetic approach toward how we deal with mass incarceration  that we will do away with the lock them up and throw away the key mentality  because it's proven it doesn't work. My journey is a unique journey  but it doesn't have to be that way. Anybody can have a transformation if we create the space for that to happen. So what I'm asking today is that you envision a world where men and women aren't held hostage to their pasts  where misdeeds and mistakes don't define you for the rest of your life. I think collectively  we can create that reality  and I hope you do too. Thank you. I am a computer science and engineering professor here at Carnegie Mellon  and my research focuses on usable privacy and security  and so my friends like to give me examples of their frustrations with computing systems  especially frustrations related to unusable privacy and security. So passwords are something that I hear a lot about. A lot of people are frustrated with passwords  and it's bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess. But what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and you're supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems  It's tough. At Carnegie Mellon  they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our passwords. The password requirement up through      was just that you had to have a password with at least one character. Pretty easy. But then they changed things  and at the end of       they announced that we were going to have a new policy  and this new policy required passwords that were at least eight characters long  with an uppercase letter  lowercase letter  a digit  a symbol  you couldn't use the same character more than three times  and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary. Now  when they implemented this new policy  a lot of people  my colleagues and friends  came up to me and they said   Wow  now that's really unusable. Why are they doing this to us  and why didn't you stop them   And I said   Well  you know what  They didn't ask me.  But I got curious  and I decided to go talk to the people in charge of our computer systems and find out what led them to introduce this new policy  and they said that the university had joined a consortium of universities  and one of the requirements of membership was that we had to have stronger passwords that complied with some new requirements  and these requirements were that our passwords had to have a lot of entropy. Now entropy is a complicated term  but basically it measures the strength of passwords. But the thing is  there isn't actually a standard measure of entropy. Now  the National Institute of Standards and Technology has a set of guidelines which have some rules of thumb for measuring entropy  but they don't have anything too specific  and the reason they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they don't actually have any good data on passwords. In fact  their report states   Unfortunately  we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules. NIST would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose  but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others.  So this is a problem  but our research group looked at it as an opportunity. We said   Well  there's a need for good password data. Maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here. So the first thing we did is  we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus and talked to students  faculty and staff  and asked them for information about their passwords. Now we didn't say   Give us your password.  No  we just asked them about their password. How long is it  Does it have a digit  Does it have a symbol  And were you annoyed at having to create a new one last week  So we got results from     students  faculty and staff  and indeed we confirmed that the new policy was very annoying  but we also found that people said they felt more secure with these new passwords. We found that most people knew they were not supposed to write their password down  and only    percent of them did  but disturbingly     percent of people said they were reusing their password. Now  this is actually more dangerous than writing your password down  because it makes you much more susceptible to attackers. So if you have to  write your passwords down  but don't reuse them. We also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords. So CMU allows    possible symbols  but as you can see  there's only a small number that most people are using  so we're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords. So this was a really interesting study  and now we had data from     people  but in the scheme of things  that's really not very much password data  and so we looked around to see where could we find additional password data  So it turns out there are a lot of people going around stealing passwords  and they often go and post these passwords on the Internet. So we were able to get access to some of these stolen password sets. This is still not really ideal for research  though  because it's not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from  or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords. So we wanted to find some better source of data. So we decided that one thing we could do is we could do a study and have people actually create passwords for our study. So we used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk  and this is a service where you can post a small job online that takes a minute  a few minutes  an hour  and pay people  a penny  ten cents  a few dollars  to do a task for you  and then you pay them through Amazon.com. So we paid people about    cents to create a password following our rules and answering a survey  and then we paid them again to come back two days later and log in using their password and answering another survey. So we did this  and we collected       passwords  and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with. So some people had a pretty easy policy  we call it Basic   and here the only rule was that your password had to have at least eight characters. Then some people had a much harder policy  and this was very similar to the CMU policy  that it had to have eight characters including uppercase  lowercase  digit  symbol  and pass a dictionary check. And one of the other policies we tried  and there were a whole bunch more  but one of the ones we tried was called Basic    and the only requirement here was that your password had to have at least    characters. All right  so now we had       passwords  and so we had much more detailed information. Again we see that there's only a small number of symbols that people are actually using in their passwords. We also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were creating  but as you may recall  there isn't a good measure of password strength. So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using  or that we could find information about in the research literature. So to give you an idea of how bad guys go about cracking passwords  they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form  called a hash  and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess as to what a password is  run it through a hashing function  and see whether it matches the passwords they have on their stolen password list. So a dumb attacker will try every password in order. They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB  and this is going to take a really long time before they get any passwords that people are really likely to actually have. A smart attacker  on the other hand  does something much more clever. They look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets  and they guess those first. So they're going to start by guessing  password   and then they'll guess  I love you   and  monkey   and             because these are the passwords that are most likely for people to have. In fact  some of you probably have these passwords. So what we found by running all of these       passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were  we found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong  and the complex passwords were pretty strong too. However  when we looked at the survey data  we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords  and the long passwords were a lot more usable  and in some cases  they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords. So this suggests that  instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords  we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords. Now here's the problem  though  Some people had long passwords that actually weren't very strong. You can make long passwords that are still the sort of thing that an attacker could easily guess. So we need to do more than just say long passwords. There has to be some additional requirements  and some of our ongoing research is looking at what additional requirements we should add to make for stronger passwords that also are going to be easy for people to remember and type. Another approach to getting people to have stronger passwords is to use a password meter. Here are some examples. You may have seen these on the Internet when you were creating passwords. We decided to do a study to find out whether these password meters actually work. Do they actually help people have stronger passwords  and if so  which ones are better  So we tested password meters that were different sizes  shapes  colors  different words next to them  and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny. As you type a better password  the bunny dances faster and faster. So this was pretty fun. What we found was that password meters do work. Most of the password meters were actually effective  and the dancing bunny was very effective too  but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up and said you were doing a good job  and in fact we found that most of the password meters on the Internet today are too soft. They tell you you're doing a good job too early  and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback  you probably would have better passwords. Now another approach to better passwords  perhaps  is to use pass phrases instead of passwords. So this was an xkcd cartoon  from a couple of years ago  and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases  and if you look at the second row of this cartoon  you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase  correct horse battery staple  would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember. He says  in fact  you've already remembered it. And so we decided to do a research study to find out whether this was true or not. In fact  everybody who I talk to  who I mention I'm doing password research  they point out this cartoon.  Oh  have you seen it  That xkcd. Correct horse battery staple.  So we did the research study to see what would actually happen. So in our study  we used Mechanical Turk again  and we had the computer pick the random words in the pass phrase. Now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words. If we asked a human to do it  they would pick things that were not very random. So we tried a few different conditions. In one condition  the computer picked from a dictionary of the very common words in the English language  and so you'd get pass phrases like  try there three come.  And we looked at that  and we said   Well  that doesn't really seem very memorable.  So then we tried picking words that came from specific parts of speech  so how about noun verb adjective noun. That comes up with something that's sort of sentence like. So you can get a pass phrase like  plan builds sure power  or  end determines red drug.  And these seemed a little bit more memorable  and maybe people would like those a little bit better. We wanted to compare them with passwords  and so we had the computer pick random passwords  and these were nice and short  but as you can see  they don't really look very memorable. And then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password. So here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something sort of pronounceable  like  tufritvi  and  vadasabi.  That one kind of rolls off your tongue. So these were random passwords that were generated by our computer. So what we found in this study was that  surprisingly  pass phrases were not actually all that good. People were not really better at remembering the pass phrases than these random passwords  and because the pass phrases are longer  they took longer to type and people made more errors while typing them in. So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases. Sorry  all of you xkcd fans. On the other hand  we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well  and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better. So one of the problems with some of the studies that we've done is that because they're all done using Mechanical Turk  these are not people's real passwords. They're the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our study. And we wanted to know whether people would actually behave the same way with their real passwords. So we talked to the information security office at Carnegie Mellon and asked them if we could have everybody's real passwords. Not surprisingly  they were a little bit reluctant to share them with us  but we were actually able to work out a system with them where they put all of the real passwords for        CMU students  faculty and staff  into a locked computer in a locked room  not connected to the Internet  and they ran code on it that we wrote to analyze these passwords. They audited our code. They ran the code. And so we never actually saw anybody's password. We got some interesting results  and those of you Tepper students in the back will be very interested in this. So we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually  .  times stronger than those affiliated with the business school. We have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well. The other interesting thing that we found is that when we compared the Carnegie Mellon passwords to the Mechanical Turk generated passwords  there was actually a lot of similarities  and so this helped validate our research method and show that actually  collecting passwords using these Mechanical Turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords. So that was good news. Okay  I want to close by talking about some insights I gained while on sabbatical last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school. One of the things that I did is I made a number of quilts  and I made this quilt here. It's called  Security Blanket.  And this quilt has the       most frequent passwords stolen from the RockYou website. And the size of the passwords is proportional to how frequently they appeared in the stolen dataset. And what I did is I created this word cloud  and I went through all       words  and I categorized them into loose thematic categories. And it was  in some cases  it was kind of difficult to figure out what category they should be in  and then I color coded them. So here are some examples of the difficulty. So  justin.  Is that the name of the user  their boyfriend  their son  Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan. Or  princess.  Is that a nickname  Are they Disney princess fans  Or maybe that's the name of their cat.  Iloveyou  appears many times in many different languages. There's a lot of love in these passwords. If you look carefully  you'll see there's also some profanity  but it was really interesting to me to see that there's a lot more love than hate in these passwords. And there are animals  a lot of animals  and  monkey  is the most common animal and the   th most popular password overall. And this was really curious to me  and I wondered   Why are monkeys so popular   And so in our last password study  any time we detected somebody creating a password with the word  monkey  in it  we asked them why they had a monkey in their password. And what we found out    we found    people so far  I think  who have the word  monkey     We found out about a third of them said they have a pet named  monkey  or a friend whose nickname is  monkey   and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute. And that guy is really cute. So it seems that at the end of the day  when we make passwords  we either make something that's really easy to type  a common pattern  or things that remind us of the word password or the account that we've created the password for  or whatever. Or we think about things that make us happy  and we create our password based on things that make us happy. And while this makes typing and remembering your password more fun  it also makes it a lot easier to guess your password. So I know a lot of these TED Talks are inspirational and they make you think about nice  happy things  but when you're creating your password  try to think about something else. Thank you. Every day we face issues like climate change or the safety of vaccines where we have to answer questions whose answers rely heavily on scientific information. Scientists tell us that the world is warming. Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe. But how do we know if they are right  Why should be believe the science  The fact is  many of us actually don't believe the science. Public opinion polls consistently show that significant proportions of the American people don't believe the climate is warming due to human activities  don't think that there is evolution by natural selection  and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines. So why should we believe the science  Well  scientists don't like talking about  science as a matter of belief. In fact  they would contrast science with faith  and they would say belief is the domain of faith. And faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science. Indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager. Blaise Pascal was a   th century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in God  and his wager went like this  Well  if God doesn't exist but I decide to believe in him nothing much is really lost. Maybe a few hours on Sunday. But if he does exist and I don't believe in him  then I'm in deep trouble. And so Pascal said  we'd better believe in God. Or as one of my college professors said   He clutched for the handrail of faith.  He made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind. Now the fact is though  for most of us  most scientific claims are a leap of faith. We can't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases. And indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties. So if you think about it  a geologist can't tell you whether a vaccine is safe. Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory. A physicist cannot tell you  despite the claims of some of them  whether or not tobacco causes cancer. So  if even scientists themselves have to make a leap of faith outside their own fields  then why do they accept the claims of other scientists  Why do they believe each other's claims  And should we believe those claims  So what I'd like to argue is yes  we should  but not for the reason that most of us think. Most of us were taught in school that the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method. We were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims. The method that most of us were taught in school  we can call it the textbook method  is the hypothetical deductive method. According to the standard model  the textbook model  scientists develop hypotheses  they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses  and then they go out into the world and they say   Okay  well are those consequences true   Can we observe them taking place in the natural world  And if they are true  then the scientists say   Great  we know the hypothesis is correct.  So there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this. One of the most famous examples comes from the work of Albert Einstein. When Einstein developed the theory of general relativity  one of the consequences of his theory was that space time wasn't just an empty void but that it actually had a fabric. And that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun. So if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it. That was a pretty startling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to test it but they did test it in       and lo and behold it turned out to be true. Starlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun. This was a huge confirmation of the theory. It was considered proof of the truth of this radical new idea  and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe. Now  sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the deductive nomological model  mainly because academics like  to make things complicated. But also because in the ideal case  it's about laws. So nomological means having to do with laws. And in the ideal case  the hypothesis isn't just an idea  ideally  it is a law of nature. Why does it matter that it is a law of nature  Because if it is a law  it can't be broken. If it's a law then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the circumstances are. And all of you know of at least one example of a famous law  Einstein's famous equation  E MC   which tells us what the relationship is between energy and mass. And that relationship is true no matter what. Now  it turns out  though  that there  are several problems with this model. The main problem is that it's wrong. It's just not true.  Laughter  And I'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong. So the first reason is a logical reason. It's the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent. So that's another fancy  academic way of saying that false theories can make true predictions. So just because the prediction comes true doesn't actually logically prove that the theory is correct. And I have a good example of that too   again from the history of science. This is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe with the Earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going around it. The Ptolemaic model was believed by many very smart people for many centuries. Well  why  Well the answer is because it made  lots of predictions that came true. The Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet  in fact more accurate predictions at first than the Copernican theory which we now would say is true. So that's one problem with the textbook model. A second problem is a practical problem  and it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. Auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even be aware that they're making. So an important example of this comes from the Copernican model  which ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system. So when Nicolaus Copernicus said  actually the Earth is not the center of the universe  the sun is the center of the solar system  the Earth moves around the sun. Scientists said  well okay  Nicolaus  if that's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the Earth around the sun. And so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallax. And astronomers said  if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star  let's say  Sirius    well I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars  but imagine you're out in the country   imagine you chose that rural life   and we look at a star in December  we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars. If we now make the same observation six months later when the Earth has moved to this position in June  we look at that same star and we  see it against a different backdrop. That difference  that angular difference  is the stellar parallax. So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes. Astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found nothing  nothing at all. And many people argued that this proved  that the Copernican model was false. So what happened  Well  in hindsight we can say  that astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses  both of which we would now say were incorrect. The first was an assumption  about the size of the Earth's orbit. Astronomers were assuming  that the Earth's orbit was large relative to the distance to the stars. Today we would draw the picture more like this  this comes from NASA  and you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small. In fact  it's actually much smaller even than shown here. The stellar parallax therefore  is very small and actually very hard to detect. And that leads to the second reason why the prediction didn't work  because scientists were also assuming that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough to detect the parallax. And that turned out not to be true. It wasn't until the   th century that scientists were able to detect the stellar parallax. So  there's a third problem as well. The third problem is simply a factual problem  that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model. A lot of science isn't deductive at all  it's actually inductive. And by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily start with theories and hypotheses  often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world. And the most famous example of that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived  Charles Darwin. When Darwin went out as a young  man on the voyage of the Beagle  he didn't have a hypothesis  he didn't have a theory. He just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist and he started to collect data. Mainly he knew that he hated medicine because the sight of blood made him sick so he had to have an alternative career path. So he started collecting data. And he collected many things   including his famous finches. When he collected these finches  he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant. Many years later back in London  Darwin looked at his data again and began to develop an explanation  and that explanation was the theory of natural selection. Besides inductive science  scientists also often participate in modeling. One of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things. And how do we do that  Well  one way you can do it is to build a model that tests an idea. So this is a picture of Henry Cadell  who was a Scottish geologist in the   th century. You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots. And Cadell wanted to answer the question  how are mountains formed  And one of the things he had observed is that if you look at mountains like the Appalachians  you often find that the rocks in them are folded  and they're folded in a particular way  which suggested to him that they were actually being compressed from the side. And this idea would later play a major role in discussions of continental drift. So he built this model  this crazy contraption with levers and wood  and here's his wheelbarrow  buckets  a big sledgehammer. I don't know why he's got the Wellington boots. Maybe it's going to rain. And he created this physical model in order to demonstrate that you could  in fact  create patterns in rocks  or at least  in this case  in mud  that looked a lot like mountains if you compressed them from the side. So it was an argument about the cause of mountains. Nowadays  most scientists prefer to work inside  so they don't build physical models so much as to make computer simulations. But a computer simulation is a kind of a model. It's a model that's made with mathematics  and like the physical models of the   th century  it's very important for thinking about causes. So one of the big questions to do with climate change  we have tremendous amounts of evidence that the Earth is warming up. This slide here  the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last     years showing that the Earth's temperature has steadily increased  and you can see in particular that in the last    years there's been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade  or almost two degrees Fahrenheit. So what  though  is driving that change  How can we know what's causing the observed warming  Well  scientists can model it using a computer simulation. So this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the Earth's climate  so sulfate particles from air pollution  volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions  changes in solar radiation  and  of course  greenhouse gases. And they asked the question  what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life  So here is the real life in black. Here's the model in this light gray  and the answer is a model that includes  it's the answer E on that SAT  all of the above. The only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurements is with all of these things put together  including greenhouse gases  and in particular you can see that the increase in greenhouse gases tracks this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last    years. And so this is why climate scientists say it's not just that we know that climate change is happening  we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason why. So now because there all these different things that scientists do  the philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said   The only principle in science that doesn't inhibit progress is  anything goes.  Now this quotation has often been taken out of context  because Feyerabend was not actually saying that in science anything goes. What he was saying was  actually the full quotation is   If you press me to say what is the method of science  I would have to say  anything goes.  What he was trying to say is that scientists do a lot of different things. Scientists are creative. But then this pushes the question back  If scientists don't use a single method  then how do they decide what's right and what's wrong  And who judges  And the answer is  scientists judge  and they judge by judging evidence. Scientists collect evidence in many different ways  but however they collect it  they have to subject it to scrutiny. And this led the sociologist Robert Merton to focus on this question of how scientists scrutinize data and evidence  and he said they do it in a way he called  organized skepticism.  And by that he meant it's organized because they do it collectively  they do it as a group  and skepticism  because they do it from a position of distrust. That is to say  the burden of proof is on the person with a novel claim. And in this sense  science is intrinsically conservative. It's quite hard to persuade the scientific community to say   Yes  we know something  this is true.  So despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts  what we find is that actually  really major changes in scientific thinking are relatively rare in the history of science. So finally that brings us to one more idea  If scientists judge evidence collectively  this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus  and to say that at the end of the day  what science is  what scientific knowledge is  is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized scrutiny  collective scrutiny  have judged the evidence and come to a conclusion about it  either yea or nay. So we can think of scientific knowledge as a consensus of experts. We can also think of science as being a kind of a jury  except it's a very special kind of jury. It's not a jury of your peers  it's a jury of geeks. It's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s  and unlike a conventional jury  which has only two choices  guilty or not guilty  the scientific jury actually has a number of choices. Scientists can say yes  something's true. Scientists can say no  it's false. Or  they can say  well it might be true but we need to work more and collect more evidence. Or  they can say it might be true  but we don't know how to answer the question and we're going to put it aside and maybe we'll come back to it later. That's what scientists call  intractable.  But this leads us to one final problem  If science is what scientists say it is  then isn't that just an appeal to authority  And weren't we all taught in school that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy  Well  here's the paradox of modern science  the paradox of the conclusion I think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to  that actually science is the appeal to authority  but it's not the authority of the individual  no matter how smart that individual is  like Plato or Socrates or Einstein. It's the authority of the collective community. You can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd  but a very special kind of crowd. Science does appeal to authority  but it's not based on any individual  no matter how smart that individual may be. It's based on the collective wisdom  the collective knowledge  the collective work  of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem. Scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust  this  show me  culture  illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence. Of course  these people don't really look like scientists  because they're much too happy. Okay  so that brings me to my final point. Most of us get up in the morning. Most of us trust our cars. Well  see  now I'm thinking  I'm in Manhattan  this is a bad analogy  but most Americans who don't live in Manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition  and their cars work  and they work incredibly well. The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down. So why is that  Why do cars work so well  It's not because of the genius of Henry Ford or Karl Benz or even Elon Musk. It's because the modern automobile is the product of more than     years of work by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people. The modern automobile is the product of the collected work and wisdom and experience of every man and woman who has ever worked on a car  and the reliability of the technology is the result of that accumulated effort. We benefit not just from the genius of Benz and Ford and Musk but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all of the people who have worked on the modern car. And the same is true of science  only science is even older. Our basis for trust in science is actually the same as our basis in trust in technology  and the same as our basis for trust in anything  namely  experience. But it shouldn't be blind trust any more than we would have blind trust in anything. Our trust in science  like science itself  should be based on evidence  and that means that scientists have to become better communicators. They have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it  and it means that we have to become better listeners. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you about one thing and just one thing only  and this has to do with when people ask me  what do you do  To which I usually respond  I do computer music. Now  a number of people just stop talking to me right then and there  and the rest who are left usually have this blank look in their eye  as if to say  what does that mean  And I feel like I'm actually depriving them of information by telling them this  at which point I usually panic and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind  which is  I have no idea what I'm doing. Which is true. That's usually followed by a second thought  which is  whatever it is that I'm doing  I love it. And today  I want to  well  share with you something I love  and also why. And I think we'll begin with just this question  What is computer music  And I'm going to try to do my best to provide a definition  maybe by telling you a story that goes through some of the stuff I've been working on. And the first thing  I think  in our story is going to be something called ChucK. Now  ChucK is a programming language for music  and it's open source  it's freely available  and I like to think that it crashes equally well on all modern operating systems. And instead of telling you more about it  I'm just going to give you a demo. By the way  I'm just going to nerd out for just a few minutes here  so I would say  don't freak out. In fact  I would invite all of you to join me in just geeking out. If you've never written a line of code before in your life  do not worry. I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this. First thing I'm going to do is to make a sine wave oscillator  and we're going to called the sine wave generator  Ge.  And then we're going to connect  Ge  to the DAC. Now this is kind of the abstraction for the sound output on my computer. Okay  So I've connected myself into the speaker. Next  I'm going to say my frequency is     hertz  and I'm going to let time advance by two seconds through this operation. All right  so if I were to play this    you would hear a sine wave at     hertz for two seconds. Okay  great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this  and then just change some of these numbers     .       I shall leave it as that  and .  and    . By doubling the frequency  we're actually going up in successive octaves  and then we have this sequence    Okay  great  now I can imagine creating all kinds of really horrible single sine wave pieces of music with this  but I'm going to do something that computers are really good at  which is repetition. I'm going to put this all in a while loop  and you actually don't need to indent  but this is purely for aesthetic reasons. It's good practice. And when we do this   that's going to go on for a while. In fact  it's probably not going to stop until this computer disintegrates. And I can't really empirically prove that to you  but I hope you'll believe me when I say that. Next  I'm going to replace this     by math.random f. I'm going to generate a random number between    and       and send that to the frequency of me. And I'm going to do this every half a second. Let's do this every     milliseconds. One hundred. All right. At this point  we've reached something that I would like to think of as the canonical computer music. This is  to me  the sound that mainframes are supposed to be making when they're thinking really hard. It's this sound  it's like  the square root of five million. So is this computer music  Yeah  I guess by definition  it's kind of computer music. It's probably not the kind of music you would listen to cruising down the highway  but it's a foundation of computer generated music  and using ChucK  we've actually been building instruments in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra  based right here at Stanford Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops  humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays. Now the reason we have these is so that for the instruments that we create out of the laptop  we want the sound to come out of somewhere near the instrument and the performer  kind of much like a traditional  acoustic instrument. Like  if I were to play a violin here  the sound would naturally not come out of the P.A. system  but from the artifact itself. So these speakers are meant to emulate that. In fact  I'm going to show you how we actually built them. The first step is to go to IKEA and buy a salad bowl. This is an    inch Blanda Matt. That's the actual name  and I actually use one of these to make salad at home as well  I kid you not. And the first step is you turn it upside down  and then you drill holes in them  six holes per hemi  and then make a base plate  put car speaker drivers in them along with amplifiers in the enclosure  and you put that all together and you have these hemispherical speaker arrays. Add people  add laptops  you have a laptop orchestra. And what might a laptop orchestra sound like  Well  let me give you a demonstration of about     instruments we've created so far for the Laptop Orchestra. And what I'm going to do is actually come over to this thing. This thing I have in front of me actually used to be a commodity gaming controller called a Gametrak. This thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands. It's tethered to the base  and this will track the position of your hands in real time. It was originally designed as a golfing controller to detect the motion of your swing. That turned out to be a rather large commercial non success  at which point they slashed prices to    dollars  at which point computer music researchers said   This is awesome  We can prototype instruments out of this.  So let me show you one instrument we've created  one of many  and this instrument is called  Twilight   and it's meant to go with this metaphor of pulling a sound out of the ground. So let me see if this will work. And put it back. And then if you go to the left  right  it sounds like an elephant in pain. This is a slightly metallic sound. Turn it just a bit. It's like a hovering car. Okay. This third one is a ratchet like interaction  so let me turn it up. So it's a slightly different interaction. The fourth one is a drone. And finally  let's see  this is a totally different interaction  and I think you have to imagine that there's this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage  and I'm going to bang it. So there we go  so that's one of many instruments in the Laptop Orchestra. Thank you. And when you put that together  you get something that sounds like this. Okay  and so  I think from the experience of building a lot of instruments for the Laptop Orchestra  and I think from the curiosity of wondering  what if we took these hopefully expressive instruments and we brought it to a lot of people  plus then a healthy bout of insanity   put those three things together   led to me actually co founding a startup company in      called Smule. Now Smule's mission is to create expressive  mobile music things  and one of the first musical instruments we created is called Ocarina. And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick. So Ocarina   is based on this ancient flute like instrument called the ocarina  and this one is the four hole English pendant configuration  and you're literally blowing into the microphone to make the sound. And there's actually a little ChucK script running in here that's detecting the strength of your blowing and also synthesizing the sound. And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer  so you can get   All right. So let me play a little ditty for you  a little Bach. And here  you'll hear a little accompaniment with the melody. The accompaniment actually follows the melody  not the other way around. And this was designed to let you take your time and figure out where your expressive space is  and you can just hang out here for a while  for a really dramatic effect  if you want  and whenever you're ready   And on these longer notes  I'm going to use more vibrato towards the end of the notes to give it a little bit more of an expressive quality. Huh  that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on. Thank you. So I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is  is this a toy or it an instrument  Maybe it's both  but for me  I think the more important question is  is it expressive  And at the same time  I think creating these types of instruments asks a question about the role of technology  and its place for how we make music. Apparently  for example  not that long ago  like only a hundred years ago   that's not that long in the course of human history   families back then used to make music together as a common form of entertainment. I don't think that's really happening that much anymore. You know  this is before radio  before recording. In the last hundred years  with all this technology  we now have more access to music as listeners and consumers  but somehow  I think we're making less music than ever before. I'm not sure why that would be. Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play. And while listening to music is wonderful  there's a special joy to making music that's all its own. And I think that's one part of the goal of why I do what I do is kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right  Now  if that's one goal  the other goal is to look to the future and think about what kind of new musical things can we make that we don't perhaps yet have names for that's enabled by technology  but ultimately might change the way that humans make music. And I'll just give you one example here  and this is Ocarina's other feature. This is a globe  and here you're actually listening to other users of Ocarina blow into their iPhones to play something. This is  G.I.R.  from Texas   R.I.K.  I don't know why it's these three letter names today  Los Angeles. They're all playing pretty  somewhat minimal music here. And the idea with this is that  well  technology should not be foregrounded here  and    Laughter    we've actually opened this up. The first thought is that  hey  you know there's somebody somewhere out there playing some music  and this is a small but I think important human connection to make that perhaps the technology affords. As a final example  and perhaps my favorite example  is that in the wake of the      earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan  a woman reached out in one of our singing apps to try to get people to join in to sing with her on a version of  Lean on Me.  Now  in these apps  there's this thing that allows any user to add their voice to an existing performance by any other user or group of users  so in some sense  she's created this kind of global ad hoc corral of strangers  and within weeks  thousands of people joined in on this  and you can kind of see people coming from all around the world and all these lines converging on the origin where the first rendition of the song was sung  and that's in Tokyo. And this is what it sounds like  when there's       people. This is       voices.   We all have pain  we all have sorrow     But if we are wise     We know that there's always tomorrow     Lean on me     When you're not strong     And I'll be your friend     I'll help you carry on     For it won't be long     Till I'm gonna need     Somebody to lean on     Just lean on     Is this computer music  Was that computer music  Yeah  I guess so  it's something that you really couldn't have done without computers. But at the same time  it's also just human  and I think what I've essentially answered so far is maybe why I do the stuff that I do  and let's just finally return to the first question  What is computer music  And I think that the catch here is that  at least to me  computer music isn't really about computers. It is about people. It's about how we can use technology to change the way we think and do and make music  and maybe even add to how we can connect with each other through music. And with that  I want to say  this is computer music  and thank you for listening. The human voice  It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world  probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say  I love you.  And yet many people have the experience that when they speak  people don't listen to them. And why is that  How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world  What I'd like to suggest  there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list  but these seven  I think  are pretty large habits that we can all fall into. First  gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit  and we know perfectly well the person gossiping  five minutes later  will be gossiping about us. Second  judging. We know people who are like this in conversation  and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. Third  negativity. You can fall into this. My mother  in the last years of her life  became very negative  and it's hard to listen. I remember one day  I said to her   It's October   today   and she said   I know  isn't it dreadful   It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. And another form of negativity  complaining. Well  this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather  sport  about politics  about everything  but actually  complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions  and again  hard to listen to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate  the sixth of the seven  embroidery  exaggeration. It demeans our language  actually  sometimes. For example  if I see something that really is awesome  what do I call it  And then  of course  this exaggeration becomes lying  and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally  dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated  you're listening into the wind. You know  somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are  seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this  Yes  there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones  foundations  that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately  these things spell a word. The word is  hail   and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition  to greet or acclaim enthusiastically  which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for  See if you can guess. The H  honesty  of course  being true in what you say  being straight and clear. The A is authenticity  just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth  which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity  being your word  actually doing what you say  and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love  but I do mean wishing people well  for two reasons. First of all  I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean  my goodness  you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love  of course  honesty is a great thing. But also  if you're really wishing somebody well  it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also  now that's what you say  and it's like the old song  it is what you say  it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible  and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with  which will increase the power of your speaking. Register  for example. Now  falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time  but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice  however. So if I talk up here in my nose  you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat  which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight  you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference  We vote for politicians with lower voices  it's true  because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again  the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich  smooth  warm  like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you  that's not the end of the world  because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing  with posture  and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing song  the meta language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word  monotonic  comes from  or monotonous  monotone. Also  we have repetitive prosody now coming in  where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question  it's a statement  And if you repeat that one  it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody  which I think is a shame  so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying something really quickly  or I can slow right down to emphasize  and at the end of that  of course  is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk  is there  We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course  pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal  but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys  So  slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally  volume. Sorry about that  if I startled anybody. Or  I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting  Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course  where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage  asking for a raise  a wedding speech. Whatever it is  if it's really important  you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on  and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually  let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment  I'm going to show you the six vocal warm up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk to anybody important  do these. First  arms up  deep breath in  and sigh out  ahhhhh  like that. One more time. Ahhhh  very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips  and we're going to go Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba  Ba. Very good. And now  brrrrrrrrrr  just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la  la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then  roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally  and if I can only do one  the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with  we  and goes to  aw.  The  we  is high  the  aw  is low. So you go  weeeaawww  weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Take a seat  thank you. Next time you speak  do those in advance. Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now  right  We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose  Or to make that a bit larger  what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound  That would be a world that does sound beautiful  and one where understanding would be the norm  and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. This is a lot of ones and zeros. It's what we call binary information. This is how computers talk. It's how they store information. It's how computers think. It's how computers do everything it is that computers do. I'm a cybersecurity researcher  which means my job is to sit down with this information and try to make sense of it  to try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean. Unfortunately for me  we're not just talking about the ones and zeros I have on the screen here. We're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros. We're talking about billions and billions of ones and zeros  more than anyone could possibly comprehend. Now  as exciting as that sounds  when I first started doing cyber   when I first started doing cyber  I wasn't sure that sifting through ones and zeros was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life  because in my mind  cyber was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer  it was keeping people's Myspace pages from being hacked  and maybe  maybe on my most glorious day  it was keeping someone's credit card information from being stolen. Those are important things  but that's not how I wanted to spend my life. But after    minutes of work as a defense contractor  I soon found out that my idea of cyber was a little bit off. In fact  in terms of national security  keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer was surprisingly low on their priority list. And the reason for that is cyber is so much bigger than any one of those things. Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives  because computers are an integral part of all of our lives  even if you don't own a computer. Computers control everything in your car  from your GPS to your airbags. They control your phone. They're the reason you can call     and get someone on the other line. They control our nation's entire infrastructure. They're the reason you have electricity  heat  clean water  food. Computers control our military equipment  everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks. All of these things are made possible because of computers  and therefore because of cyber  and when something goes wrong  cyber can make all of these things impossible. But that's where I step in. A big part of my job is defending all of these things  keeping them working  but once in a while  part of my job is to break one of these things  because cyber isn't just about defense  it's also about offense. We're entering an age where we talk about cyberweapons. In fact  so great is the potential for cyber offense that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare. Warfare. It's not necessarily a bad thing. On the one hand  it means we have whole new front on which we need to defend ourselves  but on the other hand  it means we have a whole new way to attack  a whole new way to stop evil people from doing evil things. So let's consider an example of this that's completely theoretical. Suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building  and he wants to do this again and again in the future. So he doesn't want to be in that building when it explodes. He's going to use a cell phone as a remote detonator. Now  it used to be the only way we had to stop this terrorist was with a hail of bullets and a car chase  but that's not necessarily true anymore. We're entering an age where we can stop him with the press of a button from       miles away  because whether he knew it or not  as soon as he decided to use his cell phone  he stepped into the realm of cyber. A well crafted cyber attack could break into his phone  disable the overvoltage protections on his battery  drastically overload the circuit  cause the battery to overheat  and explode. No more phone  no more detonator  maybe no more terrorist  all with the press of a button from a thousand miles away. So how does this work  It all comes back to those ones and zeros. Binary information makes your phone work  and used correctly  it can make your phone explode. So when you start to look at cyber from this perspective  spending your life sifting through binary information starts to seem kind of exciting. But here's the catch  This is hard  really  really hard  and here's why. Think about everything you have on your cell phone. You've got the pictures you've taken. You've got the music you listen to. You've got your contacts list  your email  and probably     apps you've never used in your entire life  and behind all of this is the software  the code  that controls your phone  and somewhere  buried inside of that code  is a tiny piece that controls your battery  and that's what I'm really after  but all of this  just a bunch of ones and zeros  and it's all just mixed together. In cyber  we call this finding a needle in a stack of needles  because everything pretty much looks alike. I'm looking for one key piece  but it just blends in with everything else. So let's step back from this theoretical situation of making a terrorist's phone explode  and look at something that actually happened to me. Pretty much no matter what I do  my job always starts with sitting down with a whole bunch of binary information  and I'm always looking for one key piece to do something specific. In this case  I was looking for a very advanced  very high tech piece of code that I knew I could hack  but it was somewhere buried inside of a billion ones and zeroes. Unfortunately for me  I didn't know quite what I was looking for. I didn't know quite what it would look like  which makes finding it really  really hard. When I have to do that  what I have to do is basically look at various pieces of this binary information  try to decipher each piece  and see if it might be what I'm after. So after a while  I thought I had found the piece I was looking for. I thought maybe this was it. It seemed to be about right  but I couldn't quite tell. I couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented. So I spent some time trying to put this together  but wasn't having a whole lot of luck  and finally I decided  I'm going to get through this  I'm going to come in on a weekend  and I'm not going to leave until I figure out what this represents. So that's what I did. I came in on a Saturday morning  and about    hours in  I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle. I just didn't know how they fit together. I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant. At the    hour mark  I started to get a better picture of what was there  but I had a creeping suspicion that what I was looking at was not at all related to what I was looking for. By    hours  the pieces started to come together very slowly    Laughter    and I was pretty sure I was going down the wrong path at this point  but I wasn't going to give up. After    hours in the lab  I figured out exactly what I was looking at  and I was right  it wasn't what I was looking for. I spent    hours piecing together the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten. I wasted    hours of my life searching for this kitten that had nothing at all to do with what I was trying to accomplish. So I was frustrated  I was exhausted. After    hours in the lab  I probably smelled horrible. But instead of just going home and calling it quits  I took a step back and asked myself  what went wrong here  How could I make such a stupid mistake  I'm really pretty good at this. I do this for a living. So what happened  Well I thought  when you're looking at information at this level  it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing. It's easy to not see the forest through the trees. It's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole and waste a tremendous amount of time doing the wrong thing. But I had this epiphany. We were looking at the data completely incorrectly since day one. This is how computers think  ones and zeros. It's not how people think  but we've been trying to adapt our minds to think more like computers so that we can understand this information. Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem  we should have been making the problem fit our minds  because our brains have a tremendous potential for analyzing huge amounts of information  just not like this. So what if we could unlock that potential just by translating this to the right kind of information  So with these ideas in mind  I sprinted out of my basement lab at work to my basement lab at home  which looked pretty much the same. The main difference is  at work  I'm surrounded by cyber materials  and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation. At home  I'm surrounded by everything else I've ever learned. So I poured through every book I could find  every idea I'd ever encountered  to see how could we translate a problem from one domain to something completely different  The biggest question was  what do we want to translate it to  What do our brains do perfectly naturally that we could exploit  My answer was vision. We have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information. We can combine color gradients  depth cues  all sorts of these different signals into one coherent picture of the world around us. That's incredible. So if we could find a way to translate these binary patterns to visual signals  we could really unlock the power of our brains to process this stuff. So I started looking at the binary information  and I asked myself  what do I do when I first encounter something like this  And the very first thing I want to do  the very first question I want to answer  is what is this  I don't care what it does  how it works. All I want to know is  what is this  And the way I can figure that out is by looking at chunks  sequential chunks of binary information  and I look at the relationships between those chunks. When I gather up enough of these sequences  I begin to get an idea of exactly what this information must be. So let's go back to that blow up the terrorist's phone situation. This is what English text looks like at a binary level. This is what your contacts list would look like if I were examining it. It's really hard to analyze this at this level  but if we take those same binary chunks that I would be trying to find  and instead translate that to a visual representation  translate those relationships  this is what we get. This is what English text looks like from a visual abstraction perspective. All of a sudden  it shows us all the same information that was in the ones and zeros  but show us it in an entirely different way  a way that we can immediately comprehend. We can instantly see all of the patterns here. It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here  but hours  days  to pick them out in ones and zeros. It takes minutes for anybody to learn what these patterns represent here  but years of experience in cyber to learn what those same patterns represent in ones and zeros. So this piece is caused by lower case letters followed by lower case letters inside of that contact list. This is upper case by upper case  upper case by lower case  lower case by upper case. This is caused by spaces. This is caused by carriage returns. We can go through every little detail of the binary information in seconds  as opposed to weeks  months  at this level. This is what an image looks like from your cell phone. But this is what it looks like in a visual abstraction. This is what your music looks like  but here's its visual abstraction. Most importantly for me  this is what the code on your cell phone looks like. This is what I'm after in the end  but this is its visual abstraction. If I can find this  I can't make the phone explode. I could spend weeks trying to find this in ones and zeros  but it takes me seconds to pick out a visual abstraction like this. One of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information  stuff that we haven't seen before. So I know what English looks like at a binary level  and I know what its visual abstraction looks like  but I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life. It would take me weeks just to figure out what I was looking at from raw ones and zeros  but because our brains can instantly pick up and recognize these subtle patterns inside of these visual abstractions  we can unconsciously apply those in new situations. So this is what Russian looks like in a visual abstraction. Because I know what one language looks like  I can recognize other languages even when I'm not familiar with them. This is what a photograph looks like  but this is what clip art looks like. This is what the code on your phone looks like  but this is what the code on your computer looks like. Our brains can pick up on these patterns in ways that we never could have from looking at raw ones and zeros. But we've really only scratched the surface of what we can do with this approach. We've only begun to unlock the capabilities of our minds to process visual information. If we take those same concepts and translate them into three dimensions instead  we find entirely new ways of making sense of information. In seconds  we can pick out every pattern here. we can see the cross associated with code. We can see cubes associated with text. We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts. Things that would take us weeks  months to find in ones and zeroes  are immediately apparent in some sort of visual abstraction  and as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it  what we find is that we're capable of processing billions of ones and zeros in a matter of seconds just by using our brain's built in ability to analyze patterns. So this is really nice and helpful  but all this tells me is what I'm looking at. So at this point  based on visual patterns  I can find the code on the phone. But that's not enough to blow up a battery. The next thing I need to find is the code that controls the battery  but we're back to the needle in a stack of needles problem. That code looks pretty much like all the other code on that system. So I might not be able to find the code that controls the battery  but there's a lot of things that are very similar to that. You have code that controls your screen  that controls your buttons  that controls your microphones  so even if I can't find the code for the battery  I bet I can find one of those things. So the next step in my binary analysis process is to look at pieces of information that are similar to each other. It's really  really hard to do at a binary level  but if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead  I don't even have to sift through the raw data. All I have to do is wait for the image to light up to see when I'm at similar pieces. I follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs to find exactly what I'm looking for. So at this point in the process  I've located the code responsible for controlling your battery  but that's still not enough to blow up a phone. The last piece of the puzzle is understanding how that code controls your battery. For this  I need to identify very subtle  very detailed relationships within that binary information  another very hard thing to do when looking at ones and zeros. But if we translate that information into a physical representation  we can sit back and let our visual cortex do all the hard work. It can find all the detailed patterns  all the important pieces  for us. It can find out exactly how the pieces of that code work together to control that battery. All of this can be done in a matter of hours  whereas the same process would have taken months in the past. This is all well and good in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation. I wanted to find out if this would really work in the work I do every day. So I was playing around with these same concepts with some of the data I've looked at in the past  and yet again  I was trying to find a very detailed  specific piece of code inside of a massive piece of binary information. So I looked at it at this level  thinking I was looking at the right thing  only to see this doesn't have the connectivity I would have expected for the code I was looking for. In fact  I'm not really sure what this is  but when I stepped back a level and looked at the similarities within the code I saw  this doesn't have similarities like any code that exists out there. I can't even be looking at code. In fact  from this perspective  I could tell  this isn't code. This is an image of some sort. And from here  I can see  it's not just an image  this is a photograph. Now that I know it's a photograph  I've got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information  so in a matter of seconds  we can take this information  shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking at. I saw    Laughter    it was that darn kitten again. All this is enabled because we were able to find a way to translate a very hard problem to something our brains do very naturally. So what does this mean  Well  for kittens  it means no more hiding in ones and zeros. For me  it means no more wasted weekends. For cyber  it means we have a radical new way to tackle the most impossible problems. It means we have a new weapon in the evolving theater of cyber warfare  but for all of us  it means that cyber engineers now have the ability to become first responders in emergency situations. When seconds count  we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys. Thank you.
