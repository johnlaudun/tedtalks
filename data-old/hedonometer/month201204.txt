Just a moment ago  my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck. Her text said   Mom  you will rock.  I love this. Getting that text was like getting a hug. And so there you have it. I embody the central paradox. I'm a woman who loves getting texts who's going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem. Actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of my story.       when I gave my first TEDTalk  Rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row. I had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and I was about to be on the cover of Wired magazine. In those heady days  we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities. We were exploring different aspects of ourselves. And then we unplugged. I was excited. And  as a psychologist  what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves  about our identity  to live better lives in the real world. Now fast forward to     . I'm back here on the TED stage again. My daughter's   . She's a college student. She sleeps with her cellphone  so do I. And I've just written a new book  but this time it's not one that will get me on the cover of Wired magazine. So what happened  I'm still excited by technology  but I believe  and I'm here to make the case  that we're letting it take us places that we don't want to go. Over the past    years  I've studied technologies of mobile communication and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people  young and old  about their plugged in lives. And what I've found is that our little devices  those little devices in our pockets  are so psychologically powerful that they don't only change what we do  they change who we are. Some of the things we do now with our devices are things that  only a few years ago  we would have found odd or disturbing  but they've quickly come to seem familiar  just how we do things. So just to take some quick examples  People text or do email during corporate board meetings. They text and shop and go on Facebook during classes  during presentations  actually during all meetings. People talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you're texting. People explain to me that it's hard  but that it can be done. Parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children complain about not having their parents' full attention. But then these same children deny each other their full attention. This is a recent shot of my daughter and her friends being together while not being together. And we even text at funerals. I study this. We remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones. Why does this matter  It matters to me because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble    trouble certainly in how we relate to each other  but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for self reflection. We're getting used to a new way of being alone together. People want to be with each other  but also elsewhere    connected to all the different places they want to be. People want to customize their lives. They want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention. So you want to go to that board meeting  but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you. And some people think that's a good thing. But you can end up hiding from each other  even as we're all constantly connected to each other. A    year old business man lamented to me that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work. When he goes to work  he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody  he doesn't call. And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues because  he says   They're too busy on their email.  But then he stops himself and he says   You know  I'm not telling you the truth. I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted. I think I should want to  but actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry.  Across the generations  I see that people can't get enough of each other  if and only if they can have each other at a distance  in amounts they can control. I call it the Goldilocks effect  not too close  not too far  just right. But what might feel just right for that middle aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face to face relationships. An    year old boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wistfully   Someday  someday  but certainly not now  I'd like to learn how to have a conversation.  When I ask people  What's wrong with having a conversation   People say   I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation. It takes place in real time and you can't control what you're going to say.  So that's the bottom line. Texting  email  posting  all of these things let us present the self as we want to be. We get to edit  and that means we get to delete  and that means we get to retouch  the face  the voice  the flesh  the body    not too little  not too much  just right. Human relationships are rich and they're messy and they're demanding. And we clean them up with technology. And when we do  one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation for mere connection. We short change ourselves. And over time  we seem to forget this  or we seem to stop caring. I was caught off guard when Stephen Colbert asked me a profound question  a profound question. He said   Don't all those little tweets  don't all those little sips of online communication  add up to one big gulp of real conversation   My answer was no  they don't add up. Connecting in sips may work for gathering discreet bits of information  they may work for saying   I'm thinking about you   or even for saying   I love you      I mean  look at how I felt when I got that text from my daughter    but they don't really work for learning about each other  for really coming to know and understand each other. And we use conversations with each other to learn how to have conversations with ourselves. So a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self reflection. For kids growing up  that skill is the bedrock of development. Over and over I hear   I would rather text than talk.  And what I'm seeing is that people get so used to being short changed out of real conversation  so used to getting by with less  that they've become almost willing to dispense with people altogether. So for example  many people share with me this wish  that some day a more advanced version of Siri  the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone  will be more like a best friend  someone who will listen when others won't. I believe this wish reflects a painful truth that I've learned in the past    years. That feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology. That's why it's so appealing to have a Facebook page or a Twitter feed    so many automatic listeners. And the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us. We're developing robots  they call them sociable robots  that are specifically designed to be companions    to the elderly  to our children  to us. Have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other  During my research I worked in nursing homes  and I brought in these sociable robots that were designed to give the elderly the feeling that they were understood. And one day I came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal. It seemed to be looking in her eyes. It seemed to be following the conversation. It comforted her. And many people found this amazing. But that woman was trying to make sense of her life with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life. That robot put on a great show. And we're vulnerable. People experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing. So during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy  I was thinking   That robot can't empathize. It doesn't face death. It doesn't know life.  And as that woman took comfort in her robot companion  I didn't find it amazing  I found it one of the most wrenching  complicated moments in my    years of work. But when I stepped back  I felt myself at the cold  hard center of a perfect storm. We expect more from technology and less from each other. And I ask myself   Why have things come to this   And I believe it's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable. And we are vulnerable. We're lonely  but we're afraid of intimacy. And so from social networks to sociable robots  we're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. We turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control. But we're not so comfortable. We are not so much in control. These days  those phones in our pockets are changing our minds and hearts because they offer us three gratifying fantasies. One  that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be  two  that we will always be heard  and three  that we will never have to be alone. And that third idea  that we will never have to be alone  is central to changing our psyches. Because the moment that people are alone  even for a few seconds  they become anxious  they panic  they fidget  they reach for a device. Just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light. Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved. And so people try to solve it by connecting. But here  connection is more like a symptom than a cure. It expresses  but it doesn't solve  an underlying problem. But more than a symptom  constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves. It's shaping a new way of being. The best way to describe it is  I share therefore I am. We use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we're having them. So before it was  I have a feeling  I want to make a call. Now it's  I want to have a feeling  I need to send a text. The problem with this new regime of  I share therefore I am  is that  if we don't have connection  we don't feel like ourselves. We almost don't feel ourselves. So what do we do  We connect more and more. But in the process  we set ourselves up to be isolated. How do you get from connection to isolation  You end up isolated if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude  the ability to be separate  to gather yourself. Solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments. When we don't have the capacity for solitude  we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive. When this happens  we're not able to appreciate who they are. It's as though we're using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self. We slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel less alone. But we're at risk  because actually it's the opposite that's true. If we're not able to be alone  we're going to be more lonely. And if we don't teach our children to be alone  they're only going to know how to be lonely. When I spoke at TED in       reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities  I said   Those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self reflection.  And that's what I'm calling for here  now  reflection and  more than that  a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us  what it might be costing us. We're smitten with technology. And we're afraid  like young lovers  that too much talking might spoil the romance. But it's time to talk. We grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up. But it's not  it's early days. There's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it  how we build it. I'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices  just that we develop a more self aware relationship with them  with each other and with ourselves. I see some first steps. Start thinking of solitude as a good thing. Make room for it. Find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children. Create sacred spaces at home    the kitchen  the dining room    and reclaim them for conversation. Do the same thing at work. At work  we're so busy communicating that we often don't have time to think  we don't have time to talk  about the things that really matter. Change that. Most important  we all really need to listen to each other  including to the boring bits. Because it's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves to each other. Technology is making a bid to redefine human connection    how we care for each other  how we care for ourselves    but it's also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction. I'm optimistic. We have everything we need to start. We have each other. And we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability. That we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler. So in my work  I hear that life is hard  relationships are filled with risk. And then there's technology    simpler  hopeful  optimistic  ever young. It's like calling in the cavalry. An ad campaign promises that online and with avatars  you can  Finally  love your friends love your body  love your life  online and with avatars.  We're drawn to virtual romance  to computer games that seem like worlds  to the idea that robots  robots  will someday be our true companions. We spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends. But our fantasies of substitution have cost us. Now we all need to focus on the many  many ways technology can lead us back to our real lives  our own bodies  our own communities  our own politics  our own planet. They need us. Let's talk about how we can use digital technology  the technology of our dreams  to make this life the life we can love. Thank you. Hi. I did that for two reasons. First of all  I wanted to give you a good visual first impression. But the main reason I did it is that that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic. I'm used to a stationary mic. It's the sensible shoe of public address. But you clamp this thing on my head  and something happens. I just become skanky. And I'm already off message. Ladies and gentlemen  I have devoted the past    years of my life to designing books. You cannot turn them off with a switch. Tell your kids.   It all sort of started as a benign mistake  like penicillin.  Laughter  What I really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in New York City. But upon arrival there  in the fall of       and doing a lot of interviews  I found that the only thing I was offered was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf  a book publisher. Now I was stupid  but not so stupid that I turned it down. I had absolutely no idea what I was about to become part of  and I was incredibly lucky. Soon  it had occurred to me what my job was. My job was to ask this question   What do the stories look like   Because that is what Knopf is. It is the story factory  one of the very best in the world. We bring stories to the public. The stories can be anything  and some of them are actually true. But they all have one thing in common  They all need to look like something. They all need a face. Why  To give you a first impression of what you are about to get into. A book designer gives form to content  but also manages a very careful balance between the two. Now  the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University  the teacher  Lanny Sommese  came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard  and wrote the word  Apple  underneath  and he said   OK. Lesson one. Listen up.  And he covered up the picture and he said   You either say this   and then he covered up the word   or you show this. But you don't do this.  Because this is treating your audience like a moron. And they deserve better. And lo and behold  soon enough  I was able to put this theory to the test on two books that I was working on for Knopf. The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs  and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich. Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style  it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you. The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter  it was a biography. So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures  and so we did this. So there you are. Pure content and pure form  side by side. No fighting  ladies. Now  what is the story here  Someone is re engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber. Genius  Now  luckily for me  I live and work in New York City  where there are plenty of dinosaurs. So  I went to the Museum of Natural History  and I checked out the bones  and I went to the gift shop  and I bought a book. And I was particularly taken with this page of the book  and more specifically the lower right hand corner. Now I took this diagram  and I put it in a Photostat machine  and I took a piece of tracing paper  and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape    stop me if I'm going too fast    and then I took a Rapidograph pen    explain it to the youngsters    and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur. I had no idea what I was doing  I had no idea where I was going  but at some point  I stopped    when to keep going would seem like I was going too far. And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being. We're in the middle of the process. And then I just threw some typography on it. Very basic stuff  slightly suggestive of public park signage. Everybody in house loved it  and so off it goes to the author. And even back then  Michael was on the cutting edge. That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine. I miss Michael. And sure enough  somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image  just in case they might want to use it. Well  they used it. And I was thrilled. We all know it was an amazing movie  and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it. But not too long ago  I came upon this on the Web. No  that is not me. But whoever it is  I can't help but thinking they woke up one day like   Oh my God  that wasn't there last night. Ooooohh  I was so wasted.  But if you think about it  from my head to my hands to his leg. That's a responsibility. And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly. The book designer's responsibility is threefold  to the reader  to the publisher and  most of all  to the author. I want you to look at the author's book and say   Wow  I need to read that.  David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers  and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony. And the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image  and he wanted to explore what was underlying that. For me  it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of. But when you do  you don't get what you expect. You get something that goes much deeper than that. And David especially loved this design because at book signings  which he does a lot of  he could take a magic marker and do this. Hello  Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called   Dry    and it's about his time in rehab. In his   s  he was a hotshot ad executive  and as Mad Men has told us  a raging alcoholic. He did not think so  however  but his coworkers did an intervention and they said   You are going to rehab  or you will be fired and you will die.  Now to me  this was always going to be a typographic solution  what I would call the opposite of Type    . What does that mean  Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography  you get the assignment of  select a word and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type      right  Very simple stuff. This is going to be the opposite of that. I want this book to look like it's lying to you  desperately and hopelessly  the way an alcoholic would. The answer was the most low tech thing you can imagine. I set up the type  I printed it out on an Epson printer with water soluble ink  taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto  Then when we went to press  the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running. Not long after it came out  Augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books. And this woman came up to it  and she squinted  and she took it to the register  and she said to the man behind the counter   This one's ruined.  And the guy behind the counter said   I know  lady. They all came in that way.  Now  that's a good printing job. A book cover is a distillation. It is a haiku  if you will  of the story. This particular story by Osama Tezuka is his epic life of the Buddha  and it's eight volumes in all. But the best thing is when it's on your shelf  you get a shelf life of the Buddha  moving from one age to the next. All of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book  but once the book designer has read the text  then he has to be an interpreter and a translator. This story was a real puzzle. This is what it's about. All right  so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together. And so  here's the design  right  And so here's the front and the spine  and it's flat. But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf. Ahh  We come upon them  the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out. Huhh  They've been discovered by the sultan. He will not be pleased. Huhh  And now the sultan is in danger. And now  we have to open it up to find out what's going to happen next. Try experiencing that on a Kindle. Don't get me started. Seriously. Much is to be gained by eBooks  ease  convenience  portability. But something is definitely lost  tradition  a sensual experience  the comfort of thingy ness    a little bit of humanity. Do you know what John Updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf  He'd smell it. Then he'd run his hand over the rag paper  and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages. All those years  all those books  he never got tired of it. Now  I am all for the iPad  but trust me    smelling it will get you nowhere. Now the Apple guys are texting   Develop odor emission plug in.  And the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story. A woman named Aomame in      Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom  she can't help but feel that  all of a sudden  she's entered a new reality that's just slightly different from the one that she left  but very similar  but different. And so  we're talking about parallel planes of existence  sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers. So how do we show this  We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich  but now we merge them. So we're talking about different planes  different pieces of paper. So this is on a semi transparent piece of velum. It's one part of the form and content. When it's on top of the paper board  which is the opposite  it forms this. So even if you don't know anything about this book  you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence. And the object itself invited exploration interaction  consideration and touch. This debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Seller list. This is unheard of  both for us the publisher  and the author. We're talking a     page book that is as weird as it is compelling  and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a German Shepherd to explode. Not exactly Jackie Collins. Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list  eight printings  and still going strong. So even though we love publishing as an art  we very much know it's a business too  and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky  that great art can be great business. So that's my story. To be continued. What does it look like  Yes. It can  it does and it will  but for this book designer  page turner  dog eared place holder  notes in the margins taker  ink sniffer  the story looks like this. Thank you. You know  cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy. For students  it's quite an experience  but for a school  it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain. So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught  they do not have a cadaver dissection lab. Maybe those reasons  or depending on where you are  cadavers may not be easily available. So to address this  we developed with a Dr. Brown in Stanford  virtual dissection table. So we call this Anatomage Table. So with this Anatomage Table  students can experience the dissection without a human cadaver. And the table form is important  and since it's touch interactive  just like the way they do dissections in the lab  or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table. Our digital body is one to one life size  so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy. I'm going to do some demonstrations. As you can see  I use my finger to interact with my digital body. I'm going to do some cuts. I can cut any way I want to  so I cut right here. Then it's going to show inside. And I can change my cut to see different parts. Maybe I can cut there  see the brain  and I can change my cut. You can see some internal organs. So we call this the slicer mode. OK  I'm going to do another cut. Right there. This shows a lot of internal structures. So if I want to see the back side  I can flip and see from behind. Like this. So if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you  that means we did the right job. So our doctors said these are eye candies. So instead of just butchering the body  I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections. What I'm going to do is I'm going to peel off all the skin  muscles and bones  just to see a few internal organs. Right here. Let's say I'm going to cut the liver right here. OK. Let's say I'm interested in looking at the heart. I'm going to do some surgery here. I'm going to cut some veins  arteries. Oops  ... You don't want to hear  oops  in real surgery. But fortunately  our digital man has  undo.  Okay. All right then. Let me zoom in. I'm going to make a cut right there. And then you can see the inside of the heart. You can see the atrium and the ventricles  how blood flows to our arteries and veins. Just like this  students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to. It doesn't have to be always dissection. Since it's digital  we can do reverse dissection. So let me show you  I'm going to start with the skeletal structure  and I can add a few internal organs. Yep. Maybe I can add quickly this way. And I can build muscles gradually  just like that. We can see tendons and muscles. Wish I could build my muscle this fast. And this is another way to learn anatomy. Another thing I can show you is  more often than not  doctors get to meet patients in X ray form. So  Anatomage Table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in X ray. You can also interact with your X ray  and also if you want  you can compare with how anatomy would appear in X ray  too. So when you are done  just bring back the body and then it's ready for another session. It looks like our table also can transform gender  too. It's a female now. So this is Anatomage Table. Thank you. I call myself a body architect. I trained in classical ballet and have a background in architecture and fashion. As a body architect  I fascinate with the human body and explore how I can transform it. I worked at Philips Electronics in the far future design research lab  looking    years into the future. I explored the human skin  and how technology can transform the body. I worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo  which is augmented by touch  or dresses that blushed and shivered with light. I started my own experiments. These were the low tech approaches to the high tech conversations I was having. These are Q tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue. I started a collaboration with a friend of mine  Bart Hess    he doesn't normally look like this    and we used ourselves as models. We transformed our apartments into our laboratories  and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way. We were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution. Whilst I was at Philips  we discussed this idea of a maybe technology  something that wasn't either switched on or off  but in between. A maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid. And I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body  so you couldn't see where the skin ended and the near environment started. I set up my studio in the red light district and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing  and found a way to redefine the skin and create this dynamic textile. I was introduced to Robyn  the Swedish pop star  and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion. And she talked about how technology with these new feathers  this new face paint  this punk  the way that we identify with the world  and we made this music video. I'm fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology  and I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram biology  in the future  away from disease and aging. And I thought about this concept of  imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor  modify and biologically enhance it  and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other  Or the way that we attract sexual partners  And would we revert back to being more like animals  more primal modes of communication  I worked with a synthetic biologist  and I created a swallowable perfume  which is a cosmetic pill that you eat and the fragrance comes out through the skin's surface when you perspire. It completely blows apart the way that perfume is  and provides a whole new format. It's perfume coming from the inside out. It redefines the role of skin  and our bodies become an atomizer. I've learned that there's no boundaries  and if I look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense. But when I look towards the future  the next project is completely unknown and wide open. I feel like I have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me  and it's these conversations and these experiences that connect these ideas  and they kind of instinctively come out. As a body architect  I've created this limitless and boundless platform for me to discover whatever I want. And I feel like I've just got started. So here's to another day at the office. Thank you  Thank you  Tonight  I want to have a conversation about this incredible global issue that's at the intersection of land use  food and environment  something we can all relate to  and what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth. But first  I want to take you on a little journey. Let's first visit our planet  but at night  and from space. This is what our planet looks like from outer space at nighttime  if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet. And the thing you would notice first  of course  is how dominant the human presence on our planet is. We see cities  we see oil fields  you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea  that we are dominating much of our planet  and mostly through the use of energy that we see here at night. But let's go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the daytime. What we see during the day is our landscapes. This is part of the Amazon Basin  a place called Rond nia in the south center part of the Brazilian Amazon. If you look really carefully in the upper right hand corner  you're going to see a thin white line  which is a road that was built in the     s. If we come back to the same place in       what we're going to find is that these roads spurt off more roads  and more roads after that  at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest where there are going to be a few cows. These cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows. And these cows are eaten basically in South America  in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here. But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation is something we notice a lot of around the tropics  especially in this part of the world. If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world  we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon  here also in       and if you look really carefully  there's a thin white line through that kind of seam  and there's a lone farmer out there in the middle of the primeval jungle. Let's come back again a few years later  here in       and we'll see that that landscape actually looks a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest. In fact  what you're seeing here are soybean fields. These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China as animal feed  especially after the mad cow disease scare about a decade ago  where we don't want to feed animals animal protein anymore  because that can transmit disease. Instead  we want to feed them more vegetable proteins. So soybeans have really exploded  showing how trade and globalization are really responsible for the connections to rainforests and the Amazon    an incredibly strange and interconnected world that we have today. Well  again and again  what we find as we look around the world in our little tour of the world is that landscape after landscape after landscape have been cleared and altered for growing food and other crops. So one of the questions we've been asking is  how much of the world is used to grow food  and where is it exactly  and how can we change that into the future  and what does it mean  Well  our team has been looking at this on a global scale  using satellite data and ground based data kind of to track farming on a global scale. And this is what we found  and it's startling. This map shows the presence of agriculture on planet Earth. The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops  like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever. That's    million square kilometers' worth of land. If you put it all together in one place  it'd be the size of South America. The second area  in brown  is the world's pastures and rangelands  where our animals live. That area's about    million square kilometers  or about an Africa's worth of land  a huge amount of land  and it's the best land  of course  is what you see. And what's left is  like  the middle of the Sahara Desert  or Siberia  or the middle of a rain forest. We're using a planet's worth of land already. If we look at this carefully  we find it's about    percent of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture  and it's    times larger than all the areas we complain about  our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live. Half of humanity lives in cities today  but a    times larger area is used to grow food. So this is an amazing kind of result  and it really shocked us when we looked at that. So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture  but also we're using a lot of water. This is a photograph flying into Arizona  and when you look at it  you're like   What are they growing here   It turns out they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert using water sprayed on top. Now  the irony is  it's probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities. But what's really interesting is  this water's got to come from some place  and it comes from here  the Colorado River in North America. Well  the Colorado on a typical day in the     s  this is just  you know  not a flood  not a drought  kind of an average day  it looks something like this. But if we come back today  during a normal condition to the exact same location  this is what's left. The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food  or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale  you take your pick. Well  this is a lot of water  and again  we're mining water and using it to grow food  and today  if you travel down further down the Colorado  it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean. We've literally consumed an entire river in North America for irrigation. Well  that's not even the worst example in the world. This probably is  the Aral Sea. Now  a lot you will remember this from your geography classes. This is in the former Soviet Union in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan  one of the great inland seas of the world. But there's kind of a paradox here  because it looks like it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here  The reason it's here is because  on the right hand side  you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand  feeding this basin with water. Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east  where snow melts  it travels down the river through the desert  and forms the great Aral Sea. Well  in the     s  the Soviets decided to divert that water to irrigate the desert to grow cotton  believe it or not  in Kazakhstan  to sell cotton to the international markets to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union. They really needed the money. Well  you can imagine what happens. You turn off the water supply to the Aral Sea  what's going to happen  Here it is in                         and about    months ago. It's pretty extraordinary. Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest. Imagine that was Lake Superior. Imagine that was Lake Huron. It's an extraordinary change. This is not only a change in water and where the shoreline is  this is a change in the fundamentals of the environment of this region. Let's start with this. The Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club. Let's put it that way. So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty. There's a lot of toxic waste  a lot of things that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne. One of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of Soviet biological weapons testing. You can walk there today. Weather patterns have changed. Nineteen of the unique    fish species found only in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth. This is an environmental disaster writ large. But let's bring it home. This is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the Soviet Union a long  long time ago  showing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea. You see the canal they dug  They were so desperate to try to  kind of  float the boats into the remaining pools of water  but they finally had to give up because the piers and the moorings simply couldn't keep up with the retreating shoreline. I don't know about you  but I'm terrified that future archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about our time in history  and wonder   What were you thinking   Well  that's the future we have to look forward to. We already use about    percent of the Earth's fresh water that's sustainable  and agriculture alone is    percent of that. So we use a lot of water  a lot of land for agriculture. We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture. Usually when we think about the atmosphere  we think about climate change and greenhouse gases  and mostly around energy  but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases too. If you look at carbon dioxide from burning tropical rainforest  or methane coming from cows and rice  or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers  it turns out agriculture is    percent of the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere from human activity. That's more than all our transportation. It's more than all our electricity. It's more than all other manufacturing  in fact. It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world. And yet  we don't talk about it very much. So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture dominating our planet  whether it's    percent of our land surface     percent of the water we use     percent of our greenhouse gas emissions. We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus around the world simply by using fertilizers  causing huge problems of water quality from rivers  lakes  and even oceans  and it's also the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss. So without a doubt  agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age. No question. And it rivals climate change in importance. And they're both happening at the same time. But what's really important here to remember is that it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing. In fact  we completely depend on it. It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity. We have to provide food and feed and  yeah  fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people in the world today  and if anything  we're going to have the demands on agriculture increase into the future. It's not going to go away. It's going to get a lot bigger  mainly because of growing population. We're seven billion people today heading towards at least nine  probably nine and a half before we're done. More importantly  changing diets. As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous  we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat  which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does. So more people  eating more stuff  and richer stuff  and of course having an energy crisis at the same time  where we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bio energy sources. So you put these together. It's really hard to see how we're going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production. Well  how are we going to do this  How are going to double global ag production around the world  Well  we could try to farm more land. This is an analysis we've done  where on the left is where the crops are today  on the right is where they could be based on soils and climate  assuming climate change doesn't disrupt too much of this  which is not a good assumption. We could farm more land  but the problem is the remaining lands are in sensitive areas. They have a lot of biodiversity  a lot of carbon  things we want to protect. So we could grow more food by expanding farmland  but we'd better not  because it's ecologically a very  very dangerous thing to do. Instead  we maybe want to freeze the footprint of agriculture and farm the lands we have better. This is work that we're doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment. The green areas here show where corn yields  just showing corn as an example  are already really high  probably the maximum you could find on Earth today for that climate and soil  but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we're only getting maybe    or    percent of the yield you should be able to get. You see a lot of this in Africa  even Latin America  but interestingly  Eastern Europe  where Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries used to be  is still a mess agriculturally. Now  this would require nutrients and water. It's going to either be organic or conventional or some mix of the two to deliver that. Plants need water and nutrients. But we can do this  and there are opportunities to make this work. But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future. We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between growing food and having a healthy environment work better. Right now  it's kind of an all or nothing proposition. We can grow food in the background    that's a soybean field   and in this flower diagram  it shows we grow a lot of food  but we don't have a lot clean water  we're not storing a lot of carbon  we don't have a lot of biodiversity. In the foreground  we have this prairie that's wonderful from the environmental side  but you can't eat anything. What's there to eat  We need to figure out how to bring both of those together into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together. Now  when I talk about this  people often tell me   Well  isn't blank the answer      organic food  local food  GMOs  new trade subsidies  new farm bills    and yeah  we have a lot of good ideas here  but not any one of these is a silver bullet. In fact  what I think they are is more like silver buckshot. And I love silver buckshot. You put it together and you've got something really powerful  but we need to put them together. So what we have to do  I think  is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation  not to have them fighting each other but to have them collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture  something I call  terraculture   or farming for a whole planet. Now  having this conversation has been really hard  and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points to people to reduce the controversy  to increase the collaboration. I want to show you a short video that does kind of show our efforts right now to bring these sides together into a single conversation. So let me show you that. by    million people each year. That's almost the size of Germany. Today  we're nearing   billion people. At this rate  we'll reach   billion people by     . And we all need food. But how  How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet  We already know climate change is a big problem. But it's not the only problem. We need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.' A global crisis in agriculture. Population growth   meat consumption   dairy consumption   energy costs   bioenergy production   stress on natural resources. More than     of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture. Global croplands cover    million km . That's almost the size of South America. Global pastures cover    million km . That's the size of Africa. Agriculture uses    times more land than urban and suburban areas combined. Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet. We use       cubic kilometers of water on crops every year. That's enough to fill       Empire State Buildings every day. Today  many large rivers have reduced flows. Some dry up altogether. Look at the Aral Sea  now turned to desert. Or the Colorado River  which no longer flows to the ocean. Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment. The consequence  Widespread water pollution and massive degradation of lakes and rivers. Surprisingly  agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change. It generates     of greenhouse gas emissions. That's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry  or from all the world's planes  trains and automobiles. Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation  methane from animals and rice fields  and nitrous oxide from over fertilizing. There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture. And there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival. Here's the dilemma... As the world grows by several billion more people  We'll need to double  maybe even triple  global food production. So where do we go from here  We need a bigger conversation  an international dialogue. We need to invest in real solutions  incentives for farmers  precision agriculture  new crop varieties  drip irrigation  gray water recycling  better tillage practices  smarter diets. We need everyone at the table. Advocates of commercial agriculture  environmental conservation  and organic farming... must work together. There is no single solution. We need collaboration  imagination  determination  because failure is not an option. How do we feed the world without destroying it  Yeah  so we face one of the greatest grand challenges in all of human history today  the need to feed nine billion people and do so sustainably and equitably and justly  at the same time protecting our planet for this and future generations. This is going to be one of the hardest things we ever have done in human history  and we absolutely have to get it right  and we have to get it right on our first and only try. So thanks very much.  Applause  Hi  my name is Frank  and I collect secrets. It all started with a crazy idea in November of     . I printed up       self addressed postcards  just like this. They were blank on one side  and on the other side I listed some simple instructions. I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they'd never told anyone before. And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington  D.C.  not knowing what to expect. But soon the idea began spreading virally. People began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards. I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox  not just with postmarks from Washington  D.C.  but from Texas  California  Vancouver  New Zealand  Iraq. Soon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy. PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement free blog in the world. And this is my postcard collection today. You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half million secrets. What I'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection  starting with this one.  I found these stamps as a child  and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to. I never did have someone.  Secrets can take many forms. They can be shocking or silly or soulful. They can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet. Maybe one of you sent this one in. I don't know. This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard. This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side.  Dear Birthmother  I have great parents. I've found love. I'm happy.  Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas  of frailty and heroism  playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now.  Everyone who knew me before      believes I'm dead.   I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people  so sometimes I didn't wear panties  and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself.  This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you. I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students. And sometimes afterwards I'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students. And this next postcard was made out of one of those photos. And I should also mention that  just like today  at that PostSecret event  I was using a wireless microphone.  Your mic wasn't off during sound check. We all heard you pee.  This was really embarrassing when it happened  until I realized it could have been worse. Right. You know what I'm saying.  Inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn't use. I feel like the happiest person on Earth  now.    One of these men is the father of my son. He pays me a lot to keep it a secret.   That Saturday when you wondered where I was  well  I was getting your ring. It's in my pocket right now.  I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine's Day. It was the very bottom  the last secret in the long column. And it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard. And he said   Frank  I've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life.  He said   My knees are still shaking.  He said   For three years  my girlfriend and I  we've made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud. I read some to her  she reads some to me.  He says   It's really brought us closer together through the years. And so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom  I was beside myself. And I tried to act calm  not to give anything away. And just like every Sunday  we started reading the secrets out loud to each other.  He said   But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one.  But she finally did. She got to that bottom secret  his proposal to her. And he said   She read it once and then she read it again.  And she turned to him and said   Is that our cat   And when she saw him  he was down on one knee  he had the ring out. He popped the question  she said yes. It was a very happy ending. So I emailed him back and I said   Please share with me an image  something  that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending.  And he emailed me this picture.  I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer. I finally got the pictures developed and I'd love to give them to you.  This picture never got returned back to the people who lost it  but this secret has impacted many lives  starting with a student up in Canada named Matty. Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website  a website called IFoundYourCamera. Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they've found  memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos. And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week. And people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for. This one's my favorite. Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers. And it might seem like a simple idea  and it is  but the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge. Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture.  That's me  my husband and son. The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother. Thank you for making your site. These pictures mean more to me than you know. My son's birth is on this camera. He turns four tomorrow.  Every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it    sometimes crossing oceans  sometimes going through language barriers. This is the last postcard I have to share with you today.  When people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again.  When I posted this secret  dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones  sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years  messages from family or friends who had died. They said that by preserving those voices and sharing them  it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive. One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother. Secrets can take many forms. They can be shocking or silly or soulful. They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet again. Voicemail recording  First saved voice message. Grandma    It's somebody's birthday today     Somebody's birthday today     The candles are lighted     on somebody's cake     And we're all invited     for somebody's sake   You're    years old today. Have a real happy birthday  and I love you. I'll say bye for now. FW  Thank you. Thank you. June Cohen  Frank  that was beautiful  so touching. Have you ever sent yourself a postcard  Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret  FW  I have one of my own secrets in every book. I think in some ways  the reason I started the project  even though I didn't know it at the time  was because I was struggling with my own secrets. And it was through crowd sourcing  it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me  that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me. JC  And has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book  Has anyone in your life been able to tell  FW  Sometimes I share that information  yeah. I was born in Den Bosch  where the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after. And so I've always been very fond of this painter who lived and worked in the   th century. And what is interesting about him in relation to morality is that he lived at a time where religion's influence was waning  and he was sort of wondering  I think  what would happen with society if there was no religion or if there was less religion. And so he painted this famous painting   The Garden of Earthly Delights   which some have interpreted as being humanity before the Fall  or being humanity without any Fall at all. And so it makes you wonder  what would happen if we hadn't tasted the fruit of knowledge  so to speak  and what kind of morality would we have  Much later  as a student  I went to a very different garden  a zoological garden in Arnhem where we keep chimpanzees. This is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee. And I discovered there that the chimpanzees are very power hungry and wrote a book about it. And at that time the focus in a lot of animal research was on aggression and competition. I painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom  and humanity included  was that deep down we are competitors  we are aggressive  we're all out for our own profit basically. This is the launch of my book. I'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it  but they surely seemed interested in the book. Now in the process of doing all this work on power and dominance and aggression and so on  I discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights. And so what you see here is two males who have had a fight. They ended up in a tree  and one of them holds out a hand to the other. And about a second after I took the picture  they came together in the fork of the tree and they kissed and embraced each other. Now this is very interesting because at the time everything was about competition and aggression  and so it wouldn't make any sense. The only thing that matters is that you win or that you lose. But why would you reconcile after a fight  That doesn't make any sense. This is the way bonobos do it. Bonobos do everything with sex. And so they also reconcile with sex. But the principle is exactly the same. The principle is that you have a valuable relationship that is damaged by conflict  so you need to do something about it. So my whole picture of the animal kingdom  and including humans also  started to change at that time. So we have this image in political science  economics  the humanities  philosophy for that matter  that man is a wolf to man. And so deep down our nature's actually nasty. I think it's a very unfair image for the wolf. The wolf is  after all  a very cooperative animal. And that's why many of you have a dog at home  which has all these characteristics also. And it's really unfair to humanity  because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic than given credit for. So I started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals. So these are the pillars of morality. If you ask anyone   What is morality based on   these are the two factors that always come out. One is reciprocity  and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness. And the other one is empathy and compassion. And human morality is more than this  but if you would remove these two pillars  there would be not much remaining I think. And so they're absolutely essential. So let me give you a few examples here. This is a very old video  from the Yerkes Primate Center where they train chimpanzees to cooperate.          So this is already about a hundred years ago that we were doing experiments on cooperation. What you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box  and the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in. And of course  there's food on the box. Otherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard. And so they're bringing in the box. And you can see that they're synchronized. You can see that they work together  they pull at the same moment. It's already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn't be able to do that. And now you're going to get a more interesting picture  because now one of the two chimps has been fed. So one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore.       and sometimes appears to convey its wishes and meanings by gestures.   Now look at what happens  at the very end of this. He takes basically everything. So there are two interesting parts about this. One is that the chimp on the right has a full understanding he needs the partner    so a full understanding of the need for cooperation. The second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he's not interested in the food. Why would that be  Well that probably has to do with reciprocity. There's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals that they return favors. So he will get a return favor at some point in the future. And so that's how this all operates. We do the same task with elephants. Now with elephants  it's very dangerous to work with elephants. Another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant. Now you can probably make it  but it's going to be a pretty flimsy apparatus I think. And so what we did in that case    we do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik    is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope  a single rope. And if you pull on this side of the rope  the rope disappears on the other side. So two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time and pull. Otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears. And the first tape you're going to see is two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus. The apparatus is on the left with food on it. And so they come together  they arrive together  they pick it up together and they pull together. So it's actually fairly simple for them. There they are. And so that's how they bring it in. But now we're going to make it more difficult. Because the whole purpose of this experiment is to see how well they understand cooperation. Do they understand that as well as the chimps  for example  And so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other  and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope    because if he pulls at the rope  it disappears and the whole test is over. Now this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it. But it shows the understanding that he has  because he puts his big foot on the rope  stands on the rope and waits there for the other  and then the other is going to do all the work for him. So it's what we call freeloading. But it shows the intelligence that the elephants have. They develop several of these alternative techniques that we did not approve of necessarily. So the other elephant is now coming and is going to pull it in. Now look at the other. The other doesn't forget to eat  of course. This was the cooperation  reciprocity part. Now something on empathy. Empathy is my main topic at the moment of research. And empathy has sort of two qualities. One is the understanding part of it. This is just a regular definition  the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. And the emotional part. And so empathy has basically two channels. One is the body channel. If you talk with a sad person  you're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture  and before you know it you feel sad. And that's sort of the body channel of emotional empathy  which many animals have. Your average dog has that also. That's actually why people keep mammals in the home and not turtles or snakes or something like that who don't have that kind of empathy. And then there's a cognitive channel  which is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else. And that's more limited. There's few animals    I think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing    but there are very few animals who can do that. So synchronization  which is part of that whole empathy mechanism is a very old one in the animal kingdom. And in humans  of course  we can study that with yawn contagion. Humans yawn when others yawn. And it's related to empathy. It activates the same areas in the brain. Also  we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic. People who have problems with empathy  such as autistic children  they don't have yawn contagion. So it is connected. And we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head. So that's what you see on the upper left  an animated head that yawns. And there's a chimpanzee watching  an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations. So yawn contagion that you're probably all familiar with    and maybe you're going to start yawning soon now    is something that we share with other animals. And that's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy and that is universal in the mammals basically. Now we also study more complex expressions. This is consolation. This is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he's screaming  and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him and calms him down. That's consolation. It's very similar to human consolation. And consolation behavior  it's empathy driven. Actually the way to study empathy in human children is to instruct a family member to act distressed  and then they see what young children do. And so it is related to empathy  and that's the kind of expressions we look at. We also recently published an experiment you may have heard about. It's on altruism and chimpanzees where the question is  do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else  And for decades it had been assumed that only humans can do that  that only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else. Now we did a very simple experiment. We do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville  in the field station of Yerkes. And so that's how they live. And we call them into a room and do experiments with them. In this case  we put two chimpanzees side by side. and one has a bucket full of tokens  and the tokens have different meanings. One kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses  the other one feeds both of them. So this is a study we did with Vicky Horner. And here you have the two color tokens. So they have a whole bucket full of them. And they have to pick one of the two colors. You will see how that goes. So if this chimp makes the selfish choice  which is the red token in this case  he needs to give it to us. So we pick it up  we put it on a table where there's two food rewards  but in this case only the one on the right gets food. The one on the left walks away because she knows already. that this is not a good test for her. Then the next one is the pro social token. So the one who makes the choices    that's the interesting part here    for the one who makes the choices  it doesn't really matter. So she gives us now a pro social token and both chimps get fed. So the one who makes the choices always gets a reward. So it doesn't matter whatsoever. And she should actually be choosing blindly. But what we find is that they prefer the pro social token. So this is the    percent line that's the random expectation. And especially if the partner draws attention to itself  they choose more. And if the partner puts pressure on them    so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them    then the choices go down. It's as if they're saying   If you're not behaving  I'm not going to be pro social today.  And this is what happens without a partner  when there's no partner sitting there. And so we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well being of somebody else    especially  these are other members of their own group. So the final experiment that I want to mention to you is our fairness study. And so this became a very famous study. And there's now many more  because after we did this about    years ago  it became very well known. And we did that originally with capuchin monkeys. And I'm going to show you the first experiment that we did. It has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees. But with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys. So what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side by side. Again  these animals  they live in a group  they know each other. We take them out of the group  put them in a test chamber. And there's a very simple task that they need to do. And if you give both of them cucumber for the task  the two monkeys side by side  they're perfectly willing to do this    times in a row. So cucumber  even though it's only really water in my opinion  but cucumber is perfectly fine for them. Now if you give the partner grapes    the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket    and so if you give them grapes    it's a far better food    then you create inequity between them. So that's the experiment we did. Recently we videotaped it with new monkeys who'd never done the task  thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction  and that turned out to be right. The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber. The one on the right is the one who gets grapes. The one who gets cucumber  note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine. The first piece she eats. Then she sees the other one getting grape  and you will see what happens. So she gives a rock to us. That's the task. And we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it. The other one needs to give a rock to us. And that's what she does. And she gets a grape and she eats it. The other one sees that. She gives a rock to us now  gets  again  cucumber. She tests a rock now against the wall. She needs to give it to us. And she gets cucumber again. So this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here. Let me tell you    I still have two minutes left  let me tell you a funny story about this. This study became very famous and we got a lot of comments  especially anthropologists  economists  philosophers. They didn't like this at all. Because they had decided in their minds  I believe  that fairness is a very complex issue and that animals cannot have it. And so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the French Revolution. Now another one wrote a whole chapter saying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness if the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes. Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan  who's been doing this with chimpanzees  had a couple of combinations of chimpanzees where  indeed  the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape. So we're getting very close to the human sense of fairness. And I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile. So let me summarize. I believe there's an evolved morality. I think morality is much more than what I've been talking about  but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates  which are empathy and consolation  pro social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness. And so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up  so to speak  without necessarily God and religion involved  and to see how we can get to an evolved morality. And I thank you for your attention. Today  I'd like to talk with you about something that should be a totally uncontroversial topic. But  unfortunately  it's become incredibly controversial. This year  if you think about it  over a billion couples will have sex with one another. Couples like this one  and this one  and this one  and  yes  even this one. And my idea is this    all these men and women should be free to decide whether they do or do not want to conceive a child. And they should be able to use one of these birth control methods to act on their decision. Now  I think you'd have a hard time finding many people who disagree with this idea. Over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all. They want the power to plan their own lives and to raise healthier  better educated and more prosperous families. But  for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private  birth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public. Some people think when we talk about contraception that it's code for abortion  which it's not. Some people    let's be honest    they're uncomfortable with the topic because it's about sex. Some people worry that the real goal of family planning is to control populations. These are all side issues that have attached themselves to this core idea that men and women should be able to decide when they want to have a child. And as a result  birth control has almost completely and totally disappeared from the global health agenda. The victims of this paralysis are the people of sub Saharan Africa and South Asia. Here in Germany  the proportion of people that use contraception is about    percent. That's about what you'd expect. In El Salvador  very similar     percent. Thailand     percent. But let's compare that to other places  like Uttar Pradesh  one of the largest states in India. In fact  if Uttar Pradesh was its own country  it would be the fifth largest country in the world. Their contraception rate       percent. Nigeria  the most populous country in Africa     percent. Chad    percent. Let's just take one country in Africa  Senegal. Their rate is about    percent. But why is it so low  One reason is that the most popular contraceptives are rarely available. Women in Africa will tell you over and over again that what they prefer today is an injectable. They get it in their arm    and they go about four times a year  they have to get it every three months    to get their injection. The reason women like it so much in Africa is they can hide it from their husbands  who sometimes want a lot of children. The problem is every other time a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal  that injection is stocked out. It's stocked out     days out of the year. So can you imagine the situation    she walks all this way to go get her injection. She leaves her field  sometimes leaves her children  and it's not there. And she doesn't know when it's going to be available again. This is the same story across the continent of Africa today. And so what we've created as a world has become a life and death crisis. There are         women  per year  who say they don't want to be pregnant and they die in childbirth            women a year. There are another         women  per year  who say they didn't want to be pregnant in the first place  and they give birth to a baby and her baby dies in that first month of life. I know everyone wants to save these mothers and these children. But somewhere along the way  we got confused by our own conversation. And we stopped trying to save these lives. So if we're going to make progress on this issue  we have to be really clear about what our agenda is. We're not talking about abortion. We're not talking about population control. What I'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives  to save their children's lives and to give their families the best possible future. Now  as a world  there are lots of things we have to do in the global health community if we want to make the world better in the future    things like fight diseases. So many children today die of diarrhea  as you heard earlier  and pneumonia. They kill literally millions of children a year. We also need to help small farmers    farmers who plow small plots of land in Africa    so that they can grow enough food to feed their children. And we have to make sure that children are educated around the world. But one of the simplest and most transformative things we can do is to give everybody access to birth control methods that almost all Germans have access to and all Americans  at some point  they use these tools during their life. And I think as long as we're really clear about what our agenda is  there's a global movement waiting to happen and ready to get behind this totally uncontroversial idea. When I grew up  I grew up in a Catholic home. I still consider myself a practicing Catholic. My mom's great uncle was a Jesuit priest. My great aunt was a Dominican nun. She was a schoolteacher and a principal her entire life. In fact  she's the one who taught me as a young girl how to read. I was very close to her. And I went to Catholic schools for my entire childhood until I left home to go to university. In my high school  Ursuline Academy  the nuns made service and social justice a high priority in the school. Today  in the  Gates  Foundation's work  I believe I'm applying the lessons that I learned in high school. So  in the tradition of Catholic scholars  the nuns also taught us to question received teachings. And one of the teachings that we girls and my peers questioned was is birth control really a sin  Because I think one of the reasons we have this huge discomfort talking about contraception is this lingering concern that if we separate sex from reproduction  we're going to promote promiscuity. And I think that's a reasonable question to be asked about contraception    what is its impact on sexual morality  But  like most women  my decision about birth control had nothing to do with promiscuity. I had a plan for my future. I wanted to go to college. I studied really hard in college  and I was proud to be one of the very few female computer science graduates at my university. I wanted to have a career  so I went on to business school and I became one of the youngest female executives at Microsoft. I still remember  though  when I left my parents' home to move across the country to start this new job at Microsoft. They had sacrificed a lot to give me five years of higher education. But they said  as I left home    and I literally went down the front steps  down the porch at home    and they said   Even though you've had this great education  if you decide to get married and have kids right away  that's OK by us  too.  They wanted me to do the thing that would make me the very happiest. I was free to decide what that would be. It was an amazing feeling. In fact  I did want to have kids    but I wanted to have them when I was ready. And so now  Bill and I have three. And when our eldest daughter was born  we weren't  I would say  exactly sure how to be great parents. Maybe some of you know that feeling. And so we waited a little while before we had our second child. And it's no accident that we have three children that are spaced three years apart. Now  as a mother  what do I want the very most for my children  I want them to feel the way I did    like they can do anything they want to do in life. And so  what has struck me as I've travelled the last decade for the foundation around the world is that all women want that same thing. Last year  I was in Nairobi  in the slums  in one called Korogocho    which literally means when translated   standing shoulder to shoulder.  And I spoke with this women's group that's pictured here. And the women talked very openly about their family life in the slums  what it was like. And they talked quite intimately about what they did for birth control. Marianne  in the center of the screen in the red sweater  she summed up that entire two hour conversation in a phrase that I will never forget. She said   I want to bring every good thing to this child before I have another.  And I thought    that's it. That's universal. We all want to bring every good thing to our children. But what's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing. So many women suffer from domestic violence. And they can't even broach the subject of contraception  even inside their own marriage. There are many women who lack basic education. Even many of the women who do have knowledge and do have power don't have access to contraceptives. For     years  parents around the world have been deciding to have smaller families. This trend has been steady for a quarter of a millennium  across cultures and across geographies  with the glaring exception of sub Saharan Africa and South Asia. The French started bringing down their family size in the mid     s. And over the next     years  this trend spread all across Europe. The surprising thing to me  as I learned this history  was that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines. People who spoke the same language made that change as a group. They made the same choice for their family  whether they were rich or whether they were poor. The reason that trend toward smaller families spread was that this whole way was driven by an idea    the idea that couples can exercise conscious control over how many children they have. This is a very powerful idea. It means that parents have the ability to affect the future  not just accept it as it is. In France  the average family size went down every decade for     years in a row until it stabilized. It took so long back then because the contraceptives weren't that good. In Germany  this transition started in the     s  and it took just    years for family size to stabilize in this country. And in Asia and Latin America  the transition started in the     s  and it happened much faster because of modern contraception. I think  as we go through this history  it's important to pause for a moment and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue. It's because some family planning programs resorted to unfortunate incentives and coercive policies. For instance  in the     s  India adopted very specific numeric targets and they paid women to accept having an IUD placed in their bodies. Now  Indian women were really smart in this situation. When they went to get an IUD inserted  they got paid six rupees. And so what did they do  They waited a few hours or a few days  and they went to another service provider and had the IUD removed for one rupee. For decades in the United States  African American women were sterilized without their consent. The procedure was so common it became known as the Mississippi appendectomy    a tragic chapter in my country's history. And as recently as the     s  in Peru  women from the Andes region were given anesthesia and they were sterilized without their knowledge. The most startling thing about this is that these coercive policies weren't even needed. They were carried out in places where parents already wanted to lower their family size. Because in region after region  again and again  parents have wanted to have smaller families. There's no reason to believe that African women have innately different desires. Given the option  they will have fewer children. The question is  will we invest in helping all women get what they want now  Or  are we going to condemn them to some century long struggle  as if this was still revolutionary France and the best method was coitus interruptus  Empowering parents    it doesn't need justification. But here's the thing    our desire to bring every good thing to our children is a force for good throughout the world. It's what propels societies forward. In that same slum in Nairobi  I met a young businesswoman  and she was making backpacks out of her home. She and her young kids would go to the local jeans factory and collect scraps of denim. She'd create these backpacks and resell them. And when I talked with her  she had three children  and I asked her about her family. And she said she and her husband decided that they wanted to stop having children after their third one. And so when I asked her why  she simply said   Well  because I couldn't run my business if I had another child.  And she explained the income that she was getting out of her business afforded her to be able to give an education to all three of her children. She was incredibly optimistic about her family's future. This is the same mental calculus that hundreds of millions of men and women have gone through. And evidence proves that they have it exactly right. They are able to give their children more opportunities by exercising control over when they have them. In Bangladesh  there's a district called Matlab. It's where researchers have collected data on over         inhabitants since     . In the global health community  we like to say it's one of the longest pieces of research that's been running. We have so many great health statistics. In one of the studies  what did they do  Half the villagers were chosen to get contraceptives. They got education and access to contraception. Twenty years later  following those villages  what we learned is that they had a better quality of life than their neighbors. The families were healthier. The women were less likely to die in childbirth. Their children were less likely to die in the first thirty days of life. The children were better nourished. The families were also wealthier. The adult women's wages were higher. Households had more assets    things like livestock or land or savings. Finally  their sons and daughters had more schooling. So when you multiply these types of effects over millions of families  the product can be large scale economic development. People talk about the Asian economic miracle of the     s    but it wasn't really a miracle. One of the leading causes of economic growth across that region was this cultural trend towards smaller families. Sweeping changes start at the individual family level    the family making a decision about what's best for their children. When they make that change and that decision  those become sweeping regional and national trends. When families in sub Saharan Africa are given the opportunity to make those decisions for themselves  I think it will help spark a virtuous cycle of development in communities across the continent. We can help poor families build a better future. We can insist that all people have the opportunity to learn about contraceptives and have access to the full variety of methods. I think the goal here is really clear  universal access to birth control that women want. And for that to happen  it means that both rich and poor governments alike must make contraception a total priority. We can do our part  in this room and globally  by talking about the hundreds of millions of families that don't have access to contraception today and what it would do to change their lives if they did have access. I think if Marianne and the members of her women's group can talk about this openly and have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public  we can  too. And we need to start now. Because like Marianne  we all want to bring every good thing to our children. And where is the controversy in that  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I have some questions for Melinda. Thank you for your courage and everything else. So  Melinda  in the last few years I've heard a lot of smart people say something to the effect of   We don't need to worry about the population issue anymore. Family sizes are coming down naturally all over the world. We're going to peak at nine or    billion. And that's it.  Are they wrong  Melinda Gates  If you look at the statistics across Africa  they are wrong. And I think we need to look at it  though  from a different lens. We need to look at it from the ground upwards. I think that's one of the reasons we got ourselves in so much trouble on this issue of contraception. We looked at it from top down and said we want to have different population numbers over time. Yes  we care about the planet. Yes  we need to make the right choices. But the choices have to be made at the family level. And it's only by giving people access and letting them choose what to do that you get those sweeping changes that we have seen globally    except for sub Saharan Africa and those places in South Asia and Afghanistan. CA  Some people on the right in America and in many conservative cultures around the world might say something like this   It's all very well to talk about saving lives and empowering women and so on. But  sex is sacred. What you're proposing is going to increase the likelihood that lots of sex happens outside marriage. And that is wrong.  What would you say to them  MG  I would say that sex is absolutely sacred. And it's sacred in Germany  and it's sacred in the United States  and it's sacred in France and so many places around the world. And the fact that    percent of women in my country who are sexually experienced say they use birth control doesn't make sex any less sacred. It just means that they're getting to make choices about their lives. And I think in that choice  we're also honoring the sacredness of the family and the sacredness of the mother's life and the childrens' lives by saving their lives. To me  that's incredibly sacred  too. CA  So what is your foundation doing to promote this issue  And what could people here and people listening on the web    what would you like them to do  MG  I would say this    join the conversation. We've listed the website up here. Join the conversation. Tell your story about how contraception has either changed your life or somebody's life that you know. And say that you're for this. We need a groundswell of people saying   This makes sense. We've got to give all women access    no matter where they live.  And one of the things that we're going to do is do a large event July    in London  with a whole host of countries  a whole host of African nations  to all say we're putting this back on the global health agenda. We're going to commit resources to it  and we're going to do planning from the bottom up with governments to make sure that women are educated    so that if they want the tool  they have it  and that they have lots of options available either through their local healthcare worker or their local community rural clinic. CA  Melinda  I'm guessing that some of those nuns who taught you at school are going to see this TED Talk at some point. Are they going to be horrified  or are they cheering you on  MG  I know they're going to see the TED Talk because they know that I'm doing it and I plan to send it to them. And  you know  the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive. I hope that they'll be very proud of me for living out what they taught us about social justice and service. I have come to feel incredibly passionate about this issue because of what I've seen in the developing world. And for me  this topic has become very close to heart because you meet these women and they are so often voiceless. And yet they shouldn't be    they should have a voice  they should have access. And so I hope they'll feel that I'm living out what I've learned from them and from the decades of work that I've already done at the foundation. CA  So  you and your team brought together today an amazing group of speakers to whom we're all grateful. Did you learn anything  MG  Oh my gosh  I learned so many things. I have so many follow up questions. And I think a lot of this work is a journey. You heard the discussion about the journey through energy  or the journey through social design  or the journey in the coming and saying   Why aren't there any women on this platform   And I think for all of us who work on these development issues  you learn by talking to other people. You learn by doing. You learn by trying and making mistakes. And it's the questions you ask. Sometimes it's the questions you ask that helps lead to the answer the next person that can help you answer it. So I have lots of questions for the panelists from today. And I thought it was just an amazing day. CA  Melinda  thank you for inviting all of us on this journey with you. Thank you so much. MG  Great. Thanks  Chris. I'm a process engineer  I know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters  and cyclones  and things like that. But I also have Marfan syndrome. This is an inherited disorder. And in       I participated in a genetic study  and found to my horror  as you can see from the slide  that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range  the green line at the bottom. Everyone in here will be between  .   .   and I was already up at  . . And as you can see  my aorta dilated progressively  and I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary. The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome. Anesthetize you  open your chest  put you on an artificial heart and lung machine  drop your body temperature to about    centigrade  stop your heart  cut the aorta out  replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta. And most importantly  commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy. Normally  warfarin. The thought of the surgery was not attractive. The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening. So I said to myself   I'm an engineer  I'm in R D  this is just a plumbing problem.   I can do this  I can change this.  So I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation. The project aim is really quite simple. The only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with Marfan syndrome is that it lacks some tensile strength. So  the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe  and it would remain stable and operate quite happily. If your high pressure hose pipe or hydraulic line bulges a little  you just wrap some tape around it  it really is that simple. In concept  though not in execution. The great advantage of an external support  for me  was that I could retain all of my own bits  all of my own endothelium and valves  and not need any anticoagulation therapy. So  where do we start  This is a sagittal slice through me. In the middle  you can see that little structure squeezing out  that's the left ventricle  pushing blood out through the aortic valve. You can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there. Up into the ascending aorta. And it's that part  the ascending aorta  which dilates and ultimately bursts  which of course is fatal. We started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance and CT imaging machines  from which to make a model of the patient's aorta. This is a model of my aorta. I've got a real one in my pocket  if anyone would like to look at it  and play with it. You can see it's quite a complex structure. It has a funny tri lobal shape at the bottom  which contains the aortic valve. It then comes back into a round form  and then tapers and curves off. It's quite a difficult structure to produce. This is a sort of CAD model of me  and this is one of the later CAD models. We went through an iterative process of producing better and better models. When we produced that model  we turned it into a solid  plastic model  as you can see  using a rapid prototyping technique  another engineering technique. We then used that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh  which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta. So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best  really. Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant. Once you've made it  the installation is quite easy. John Pepper  bless his heart  professor of cardiothoracic surgery. Never done it before in his life  he put the first one in  didn't like it  he put the second one in. Happy  away I went. Four and a half hours on the table  and everything was done. So the surgical implantation was actually the easiest part. If you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative  the composite aortic root graft  there are one or two startling comparisons which I'm sure will be clear to all of you. Two hours to install one of our devices  compared to   hours for the existing treatment. As I said  the existing treatment requires the heart lung bypass machine  and it requires a total body cooling. We don't need any of that. We work on a beating heart. He opens you up  he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating  all at the right temperature. No breaking into your circulatory system. So it really is great. But for me  absolutely the best point is  there is no anticoagulation therapy required. I don't take any drugs at all  other than recreational ones that I would choose to take. And in fact  if you speak to people who are on long term warfarin  it is a serious compromise to your quality of life  and even worse  it inevitably foreshortens your life. Likewise  if you have the artificial valve option  you're committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment  even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics  in case you get an internal infection on the valve. Again  I don't have any of that  so I'm entirely free  my artery is fixed. I haven't got to worry about it  which is a rebirth for me. Back to the theme of the presentation  multidisciplinary research  how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life  Well  the answer to that is  a multidisciplinary team. This is a list of the core team  and you can see there aren't only two principal technical disciplines there  medicine and engineering  but also  there are various specialists from within those two disciplines. John Pepper was the cardiac surgeon who did all the actual work on me. But everyone else had to contribute one way or another. Raad Mohiaddin  a medical radiologist. We had to get good quality images from which to make the CAD model. Warren Thornton  who still does all our CAD models for us  had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code to produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set. There are some barriers to this  though  there are some problems. Jargon is a big one. I would think no one in this room understands the first four jargon points. The engineers amongst you will recognize  rapid prototyping  and  CAD.  The medics amongst you  if there are any  will recognize the first two  but there will be nobody else here that understands all those four words. Taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used. Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well. We took a lot of horizontal slice images through me  produced those slices and used them to build a CAD model. And the very first CAD model we made  the surgeons were playing with it and couldn't quite figure it out. And then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta. And it was a mirror image because in the real world  we always look down on plans  plans of houses  or streets  or maps. In the medical world  they look up at plans. So the horizontal images were all in inversion. So  one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions. Everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not. Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project. The Brompton Hospital was taken over by the Imperial College School of Medicine. And there are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations. I was working with the Imperial and the Brompton  and this generated some serious problems for the project. Really  problems that shouldn't exist. Research   Ethics Committee. If you want to do anything new in surgery  you have to get a license from your local Research   Ethics. I'm sure it's the same in Poland. There will be some form of equivalent which licenses new types of surgery. We didn't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that  we also had professional jealousies. There were people on the Research   Ethics committee who really didn't want to see John Pepper succeed again. Because he is so successful. And they made extra problems for us. Bureaucratic problems. Ultimately  when you have a new treatment  you have to have a guidance note for all the hospitals in the country. In the UK  we have the National Institute and Clinical Excellence. You have an equivalent in Poland  no doubt. And we had to get past the NICE problem. We now have a great clinical guidance  out on the net. So any other hospitals interested can come along  read the NICE report  get in touch with us  and then get doing it themselves. Funding barriers  another big area to be concerned with. A big problem with understanding one of those perspectives. When we first approached one of the big  charitable UK organizations that fund this kind of stuff  we essentially gave them an engineering proposal. They didn't understand it  they were doctors  next to God  it must be rubbish  they binned it. So in the end  I went after private investors  just gave up on it. Most R D is going to be institutionally funded  by the Polish Academy of Sciences or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council  or whatever. And you need to get past those people. Jargon is a huge problem when you try to work across disciplines  because in an engineering world  we all understand CAD and RP. Not in the medical world. I suppose the funding bureaucrats ultimately have to get their act together. They've really got to start talking to each other  and exercise a bit of imagination  if that's not too much to ask. Which it probably is. I've coined the phrase  obstructive conservatism.  So many people in the medical world don't want to change. Particularly when some jumped up engineer has come along with the answer. They don't want to change. They simply want to do whatever they've done before. And in fact  many surgeons in the UK are still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of an episode  so that they could say   Told you that was no good.  We've actually got    patients. At seven and a half years  we've got    post op patient years between us  and we haven't had a single problem. And still  there are people in the UK saying   That external aortic root  it will never work  you know.  It really is a problem. I'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics  doctors  surgeons  at some point. The middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves.  Well  of course  I'm looking after my patient.  I think it's not good  but that's my view. Egos  of course  again a huge problem. If you work in a multidisciplinary team  you've got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt  you've got to express support for them. Tom Treasure  professor of cardiothoracic surgery. Incredible guy. Dead easy to give him respect. Him giving me respect  Slightly different. That's all the bad news. The good news is  the benefits are stonkingly huge. Translate that one  I bet they can't. When you have a group of people with different professional training  a different professional experience  they not only have a different knowledge base  but also a different perspective on everything. And if you can bring them together  and get them talking and understanding each other  the results can be spectacular. You can find really novel solutions that have never been looked at before  very quickly and easily. You can short cut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have. And as a result  it's an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you. The result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets. I'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that I'm not prepared to tell you what it cost  because I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments  probably in the USA  which cost more for a one off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality. That's all I want to say  and I've got three minutes left. So  Ewa's going to like me. If you have any questions  please come up and talk to me later on  it would be a pleasure to speak with you. Many thanks. If you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the Vermont State House where I was a lobbyist in training and asked me what I was going to do with my life  I would have told you that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi  the Chinese equivalency exam  and I was going to go study law in Beijing  and I was going to improve U.S. China relations through top down policy changes and judicial system reforms. I had a plan  and I never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo. Little did I know what a huge impact it would have on me one night when I was at a party and I heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room. And it was Doc Watson singing and playing  Shady Grove.    Shady Grove  my little love     Shady Grove  my darlin'     Shady Grove  my little love     Going back to Harlan   That sound was just so beautiful  the sound of Doc's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo. And after being totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness and history of Chinese culture  it was like this total relief to hear something so truly American and so truly awesome. I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China. So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo  I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia and I learned a bunch of old American songs  and I ended up in Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention. And I was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me. And they said   Hey  do you want to jam   And I was like   Sure.  So I picked up my banjo and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them. And a record executive walked up to me and invited me to Nashville  Tennessee to make a record. It's been eight years  and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer. In fact  I went to Nashville. And after a few months I was writing songs. And the first song I wrote was in English  and the second one was in Chinese.  Chinese  Outside your door the world is waiting. Inside your heart a voice is calling. The four corners of the world are watching  so travel daughter  travel. Go get it  girl. It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky. And I've played thousands of shows. And I've collaborated with so many incredible  inspirational musicians around the world. And I see the power of music. I see the power of music to connect cultures. I see it when I stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs and I bust out into a song in Chinese.  Chinese  And everybody's eyes just pop wide open like it's going to fall out of their heads. And they're like   What's that girl doing   And then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story. They all come up and they're like   You know  my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China and adopted a girl.  And I tell you what  it like everybody's got a story. It's just incredible. And then I go to China and I stand on a stage at a university and I bust out into a song in Chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument  and she's singing their music. And I see  even more importantly  the power of music to connect hearts. Like the time I was in Sichuan Province and I was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone. And this little girl comes up to me.  Chinese   Big sister Wong   Washburn  Wong  same difference.  Big sister Wong  can I sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake   And I sat down  she sat on my lap. She started singing her song. And the warmth of her body and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks  and I started to cry. And the light that shone off of her eyes was a place I could have stayed forever. And in that moment  we weren't our American selves  we weren't our Chinese selves  we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here. I want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone. And I know U.S. China relations doesn't need another lawyer. Thank you. I got my start in writing and research as a surgical trainee  as someone who was a long ways away from becoming any kind of an expert at anything. So the natural question you ask then at that point is  how do I get good at what I'm trying to do  And it became a question of  how do we all get good at what we're trying to do  It's hard enough to learn to get the skills  try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you're taking on. I had to think about how I sew and how I cut  but then also how I pick the right person to come to an operating room. And then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good. In the last few years we realized we were in the deepest crisis of medicine's existence due to something you don't normally think about when you're a doctor concerned with how you do good for people  which is the cost of health care. There's not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do. The political fight that we've developed has become one around whether it's the government that's the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem. And the answer is yes and no  it's deeper than all of that. The cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us. And in order to understand this  I'm going to take you back a couple of generations. I want to take you back to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book   The Youngest Science.  Lewis Thomas was a physician writer  one of my favorite writers. And he wrote this book to explain  among other things  what it was like to be a medical intern at the Boston City Hospital in the pre penicillin year of     . It was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective. If you were in a hospital  he said  it was going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth  some food  shelter  and maybe the caring attention of a nurse. Doctors and medicine made no difference at all. That didn't seem to prevent the doctors from being frantically busy in their days  as he explained. What they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses for which they could do something. And there were a few. You might have a lobar pneumonia  for example  and they could give you an antiserum  an injection of rabid antibodies to the bacterium streptococcus  if the intern sub typed it correctly. If you had an acute congestive heart failure  they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein  giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent. If you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions  you might figure out that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis  in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic    as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them. Beyond these sorts of things  a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do. This was when the core structure of medicine was created    what it meant to be good at what we did and how we wanted to build medicine to be. It was at a time when what was known you could know  you could hold it all in your head  and you could do it all. If you had a prescription pad  if you had a nurse  if you had a hospital that would give you a place to convalesce  maybe some basic tools  you really could do it all. You set the fracture  you drew the blood  you spun the blood  looked at it under the microscope  you plated the culture  you injected the antiserum. This was a life as a craftsman. As a result  we built it around a culture and set of values that said what you were good at was being daring  at being courageous  at being independent and self sufficient. Autonomy was our highest value. Go a couple generations forward to where we are  though  and it looks like a completely different world. We have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have. We can't cure it all. We can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life. But we can make it possible for most. But what does it take  Well  we've now discovered       medical and surgical procedures. We've discovered       drugs that I'm now licensed to prescribe. And we're trying to deploy this capability  town by town  to every person alive    in our own country  let alone around the world. And we've reached the point where we've realized  as doctors  we can't know it all. We can't do it all by ourselves. There was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital  as it changed over time. And in the year       it took just over two full time equivalents of clinicians. That is to say  it took basically the nursing time and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day. By the end of the   th century  it had become more than    clinicians for the same typical hospital patient    specialists  physical therapists  the nurses. We're all specialists now  even the primary care physicians. Everyone just has a piece of the care. But holding onto that structure we built around the daring  independence  self sufficiency of each of those people has become a disaster. We have trained  hired and rewarded people to be cowboys. But it's pit crews that we need  pit crews for patients. There's evidence all around us     percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care.    percent of our asthma  stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care. Two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn't have because someone failed to follow the basic practices of hygiene. Our experience as people who get sick  need help from other people  is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to    hardworking  incredibly well trained and very smart    that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope  but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way. There's another sign that we need pit crews  and that's the unmanageable cost of our care. Now we in medicine  I think  are baffled by this question of cost. We want to say   This is just the way it is. This is just what medicine requires.  When you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin  that mostly didn't do the job  to one where  if it gets bad enough  we can do a hip replacement  a knee replacement that gives you years  maybe decades  without disability  a dramatic change  well is it any surprise that that         hip replacement replacing the    cent aspirin is more expensive  It's just the way it is. But I think we're ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do. As we've looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity has increased  we found that the most expensive care is not necessarily the best care. And vice versa  the best care often turns out to be the least expensive    has fewer complications  the people get more efficient at what they do. And what that means is there's hope. Because  if  to have the best results  you really needed the most expensive care in the country  or in the world  well then we really would be talking about rationing who we're going to cut off from Medicare. That would be really our only choice. But when we look at the positive deviants    the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs    we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful. That is to say  they found ways to get all of the different pieces  all of the different components  to come together into a whole. Having great components is not enough  and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components. We want the best drugs  the best technologies  the best specialists  but we don't think too much about how it all comes together. It's a terrible design strategy actually. There's a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this that said  what if you built a car from the very best car parts  Well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes  a Ferrari engine  a Volvo body  a BMW chassis. And you put it all together and what do you get  A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere. And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes. It's not a system. Now a system  however  when things start to come together  you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way. Skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure. When you are a specialist  you can't see the end result very well. You have to become really interested in data  unsexy as that sounds. One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids  Iowa  and he got interested in the question of  well how many CT scans did they do for their community in Cedar Rapids  He got interested in this because there had been government reports  newspaper reports  journal articles saying that there had been too many CT scans done. He didn't see it in his own patients. And so he asked the question   How many did we do   and he wanted to get the data. It took him three months. No one had asked this question in his community before. And what he found was that  for the         people in their community  in the previous year they had done        CT scans. They had found a problem. Which brings us to skill number two a system has. Skill one  find where your failures are. Skill two is devise solutions. I got interested in this when the World Health Organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery. The volume of surgery had spread around the world  but the safety of surgery had not. Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to do more training  give people more specialization or bring in more technology. Well in surgery  you couldn't have people who are more specialized and you couldn't have people who are better trained. And yet we see unconscionable levels of death  disability that could be avoided. And so we looked at what other high risk industries do. We looked at skyscraper construction  we looked at the aviation world  and we found that they have technology  they have training  and then they have one other thing  They have checklists. I did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a Harvard surgeon worrying about checklists. And yet  what we found were that these were tools to help make experts better. We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us. Could we design a checklist for surgery  Not for the lowest people on the totem pole  but for the folks who were all the way around the chain  the entire team including the surgeons. And what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than I had understood. You have to think about things like pause points. You need to identify the moments in a process when you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger and do something about it. You have to identify that this is a before takeoff checklist. And then you need to focus on the killer items. An aviation checklist  like this one for a single engine plane  isn't a recipe for how to fly a plane  it's a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they're not checked. So we did this. We created a    item two minute checklist for surgical teams. We had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given  immediately before the knife hits the skin  immediately before the patient leaves the room. And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there    making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half    and then interesting stuff  because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery. Instead  you can make a recipe for how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected. And we had items like making sure everyone in the room had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day  because you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day that you're coming in. We implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world  deliberately in places from rural Tanzania to the University of Washington in Seattle. We found that after they adopted it the complication rates fell    percent. It fell in every hospital it went into. The death rates fell    percent. This was bigger than a drug. And that brings us to skill number three  the ability to implement this  to get colleagues across the entire chain to actually do these things. And it's been slow to spread. This is not yet our norm in surgery    let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas. There's a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we're not a system  forces us to behave with a different set of values. Just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had  like humility  discipline  teamwork. This is the opposite of what we were built on  independence  self sufficiency  autonomy. I met an actual cowboy  by the way. I asked him  what was it like to actually herd a thousand cattle across hundreds of miles  How did you do that  And he said   We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around.  They communicate electronically constantly  and they have protocols and checklists for how they handle everything       from bad weather to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle. Even the cowboys are pit crews now. And it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves. Making systems work is the great task of my generation of physicians and scientists. But I would go further and say that making systems work  whether in health care  education  climate change  making a pathway out of poverty  is the great task of our generation as a whole. In every field  knowledge has exploded  but it has brought complexity  it has brought specialization. And we've come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize  as individualistic as we want to be  complexity requires group success. We all need to be pit crews now. Thank you. Last January  my company  Fark.com  was sued along with Yahoo  MSN  Reddit  AOL  TechCrunch and others by a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources. Gooseberry owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email. Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented  but it does happen all the time. Take something already being done and patent it for an emerging technology    like phone calls on the internet or video listings for TV shows or radio but for cellphones  and so on. The problem with these patents is that the mechanisms are obscure and the patent system is dysfunctional  and as a result  most of these lawsuits end in settlements. And because these settlements are under a non disclosure agreement  no one knows what the terms were. And as a result  the patent troll can claim that they won the case. In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources  this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself  and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release  and it turns out that is press release    as in P.R. Now my company  Fark  deals with news  ostensibly  and as a result we were not in violation of this patent. So case closed  right  Wrong. One of the major problems with patent law is that  in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll  the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant  which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they're suing you on. And this can take quite a while. You need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes    months when you win. That is your best case outcome when you get sued by a patent troll. Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit  but one by one they settled out of the case  even though    and this is important    none of these companies infringed on this patent    not a one of them. And they started settling out. The reason they settled out is because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit    clearly  two million dollars cheaper in some cases  and much worse if you actually lose. It would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company  especially a small eight man shop like my company. Six months into the lawsuit  we finally reached the discovery phase. And in discovery phase  we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of Fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring. Now perhaps it's because no such screenshots actually existed  but suddenly Gooseberry wanted to settle. Their attorney   Ah  yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end.  Never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A. with no employees.  And we'd like to go ahead and close this out. So would you mind giving us your best and final offer   My response   How about nothing    We didn't have high hopes for that outcome. But they settled. No counter offer. Now  as mentioned before  one of the reasons I can talk to you about this is because there's no non disclosure agreement on this case. Now how did that happen  Well during the settlement process  when we received our copy  I struck it. My attorney said   Nah  no chance of that working.  It came back signed. Now why  You can call them. They're not under NDA either. Now what did I learn from this case  Well  three things. First of all  if you can  don't fight the patent  fight the infringement. Patents are very difficult to overturn. Infringement is a lot easier to disprove. Secondly  make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money. Now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they're able to recover in settlements. If it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money  they become less interested in pursuing the case. Finally  make sure that you can tell them that you will make this process as annoying and as painful and as difficult as possible for them. Now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way. It turns out  because they're paid on contingency  it works really  really well in reverse. Don't forget that. So what does all this mean  Well to sum up  it boils down to one thing  Don't negotiate with terrorists. Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy than any domestic or foreign terrorist organization in history every year. And what do they do with that money  They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits. Now this is the point in the Talk where I'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system. And the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system. The health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors. The hi tech industry would like stronger protections for producers. And these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed  but they are at odds. And as a result  patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between. So unfortunately I'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem. However  I did have this idea  and it was kind of good. And I thought   I should patent this.  Behold  patent infringement via mobile device    defined as a computer which is not stationary. My solution  award me this patent and I will troll them out of existence. Thank you. This is Shivdutt Yadav  and he's from Uttar Pradesh  India. Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office in Uttar Pradesh  and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead. His land was no longer registered in his name. His brothers  Chandrabhan and Phoolchand  were also listed as dead. Family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land by having the brothers declared dead  allowing them to inherit their father's share of the ancestral farmland. Because of this  all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home. According to the Yadav family  the local court has been scheduling a case review since       but a judge has never appeared. There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review. Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property led to this corruption. He was laid to rest in the Ganges River  where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water. Photographing these brothers was a disorienting exchange because on paper they don't exist  and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life. Yet  these men remain dead. This quandary led to the title of the project  which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent ghosts of the past and the future. So this story is the first of    chapters in my new body of work titled  A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters.  And for this work  I traveled around the world over a four year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories. I was interested in ideas surrounding fate and whether our fate is determined by blood  chance or circumstance. The subjects I documented ranged from feuding families in Brazil to victims of genocide in Bosnia to the first woman to hijack an airplane and the living dead in India. In each chapter  you can see the external forces of governance  power and territory or religion colliding with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance. Each work that I make is comprised of three segments. On the left are one or more portrait panels in which I systematically order the members of a given bloodline. This is followed by a text panel  it's designed in scroll form  in which I construct the narrative at stake. And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel. It's a space that's more intuitive in which I present fragments of the story  beginnings of other stories  photographic evidence. And it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet  in a less linear form. So it's more disordered. And this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline. In my past projects I've often worked in serial form  documenting things that have the appearance of being comprehensive through a determined title and a determined presentation  but in fact  are fairly abstract. In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction and find an absolute catalog  something that I couldn't interrupt  curate or edit by choice. This led me to blood. A bloodline is determined and ordered. But the project centers on the collision of order and disorder    the order of blood butting up against the disorder represented in the often chaotic and violent stories that are the subjects of my chapters. In chapter two  I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin. He was sent in      to Palestine by the Zionist organization to look at areas for Jewish settlement and acquire land for Jewish settlement. He oversaw land acquisition on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company whose work led to the establishment of a Jewish state. Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem  I wanted to look at the early paperwork of the establishment of the Jewish state. And I found these maps which you see here. And these are studies commissioned by the Zionist organization for alternative areas for Jewish settlement. In this  I was interested in the consequences of geography and imagining how the world would be different if Israel were in Uganda  which is what these maps demonstrate. These archives in Jerusalem  they maintain a card index file of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration to Palestine  and later Israel  from      to     . Chapter three  Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo treated patients outside of Kisumu  Kenya for AIDS  tuberculosis  infertility  mental illness  evil spirits. He's most often paid for his services in cash  cows or goats. But sometimes when his female patients can't afford his services  their families give the women to Jura in exchange for medical treatment. As a result of these transactions  Jura has nine wives     children and    grandchildren. In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here. Two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them  three for evil spirits  one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love  paying their families a total of    cows. One wife deserted him and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits. Polygamy is widely practiced in Kenya. It's common among a privileged class capable of paying numerous dowries and keeping multiple homes. Instances of prominent social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth  status and power. You may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed there are empty portraits. These empty portraits represent individuals  living individuals  who couldn't be present. And the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel. They include dengue fever  imprisonment  army service  women not allowed to be photographed for religious and cultural reasons. And in this particular chapter  it's children whose mothers wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it. Twenty four European rabbits were brought to Australia in      by a British settler for sporting purposes  for hunting. And within a hundred years  that population of    had exploded to half a billion. The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia  and it competes with native wildlife and damages native plants and degrades the land. Since the     s  Australia has been introducing lethal diseases into the wild rabbit population to control growth. These rabbits were bred at a government facility  Biosecurity Queensland  where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits and have infected them with a lethal disease and are monitoring their progress to see if it will effectively kill them. So they're testing its virulence. During the course of this trial  all of the rabbits died  except for a few  which were euthanized. Haigh's Chocolate  in collaboration with the Foundation for Rabbit Free Australia  stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby. Now this was done to counter the annual celebration of rabbits and presumably make the public more comfortable with the killing of rabbits and promote an animal that's native to Australia  and actually an animal that is threatened by the European rabbit. In chapter seven  I focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline. So over a two day period  six individuals from this bloodline were killed in the Srebrenica massacre. This is the only work in which I visually represent the dead. But I only represent those that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre  which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe since the Second World War. And during this massacre        Bosnian Muslim men and boys were systematically executed. So when you look at a detail of this work  you can see  the man on the upper left is the father of the woman sitting next to him. Her name is Zumra. She is followed by her four children  all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre. Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well. During the time I was in Bosnia  the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave. And I was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains. However  the other individuals are represented by these blue slides  which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals. They've all been given a proper burial  so what remains are these blue slides at the International Commission for Missing Persons. These are personal effects dug up from a mass grave that are awaiting identification from family members and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory  which was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying  and also the Serbian soldiers later during the times of the executions. This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial  which from top to bottom shows a Serbian scorpion unit being blessed by an Orthodox priest before rounding up the boys and men and killing them. Chapter    is more of a performance piece. I solicited China's State Council Information Office in      to select a multi generational bloodline to represent China for this project. They chose a large family from Beijing for its size  and they declined to give me any further reasoning for their choice. This is one of the rare situations where I have no empty portraits. Everyone showed up. You can also see the evolution of the one child only policy as it travels through the bloodline. Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda  the State Council Information Office is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations. It controls all foreign media and image production outside of China from foreign media working within China. It also monitors the Internet and instructs local media on how to handle any potentially controversial issues  including Tibet  ethnic minorities  Human Rights  religion  democracy movements and terrorism. For the footnote panel in this work  this office instructed me to photograph their central television tower in Beijing. And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me when I left. These are the descendants of Hans Frank who was Hitler's personal legal advisor and governor general of occupied Poland. Now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits  highlighting a complex relationship to one's family history. The reasons for these absences include people who declined participation. There's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves. Another section of the family presented their clothing  as opposed to their physical presence  because they didn't want to be identified with the past that I was highlighting. And finally  another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation  so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable. In the footnote panel that accompanies this work I photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp and an imitation of that stamp produced by British Intelligence with Hans Frank's image on it. It was released in Poland to create friction between Frank and Hitler  so that Hitler would imagine Frank was trying to usurp his power. Again  talking about fate  I was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art. These paintings were taken by Hans Frank during the time of the Third Reich. And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time. They are Leonardo da Vinci's  Lady With an Ermine   Rembrandt's  Landscape With Good Samaritan  and Raphael's  Portrait of a Youth   which has never been found. Chapter    highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making  but becomes their own. So this is the Ferraz family and the Novaes family. And they are in an active blood feud. This feud has been going on since      in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco  and it involved the deaths of    members of the families and    others associated with the feud  including hired hit men  innocent bystanders and friends. Tensions between these two families date back to      when there was a dispute over local political power. But it got violent in the last two decades and includes decapitation and the death of two mayors. Installed into a protective wall surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes  who's the head of the Novaes family  are these turret holes  which were used for shooting and looking. Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco is one of the nation's most violent regions. It's rooted in a principle of retributive justice  or an eye for an eye  so retaliatory killings have led to several deaths in the area. This story  like many of the stories in my chapters  reads almost as an archetypal episode  like something out of Shakespeare  that's happening now and will happen again in the future. I'm interested in these ideas of repetition. So after I returned home  I received word that one member of the family had been shot    times in the face. Chapter    is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history. Children at this Ukrainian orphanage are between the ages of six and   . This piece is ordered by age because it can't be ordered by blood. In a    month period when I was at the orphanage  only one child had been adopted. Children have to leave the orphanage at age     despite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go. It's commonly reported in Ukraine that children  when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking  child pornography and prostitution. Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival  and high rates of suicide are recorded. This is a boys' bedroom. There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage and not enough warm clothing. Children bathe infrequently because the hot water isn't turned on until October. This is a girls' bedroom. And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs as an industrial size washing machine and dryer  four vacuum cleaners  two computers  a video projector  a copy machine  winter shoes and a dentist's drill. This photograph  which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms  shows a sign which I had translated when I got home. And it reads   Those who do not know their past are not worthy of their future.  There are many more chapters in this project. This is just an abridged rendering of over a thousand images. And this mass pile of images and stories forms an archive. And within this accumulation of images and texts  I'm struggling to find patterns and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead are just as coded as blood itself. But archives exist because there's something that can't necessarily be articulated. Something is said in the gaps between all the information that's collected. And there's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between. It's almost machine like the way people are born and people die  and the stories keep coming and coming. And in this  I'm considering  is this actual accumulation leading to some sort of evolution  or are we on repeat over and over again  Thank you. People are living longer and societies are getting grayer. You hear about it all the time. You read about it in your newspapers. You hear about it on your television sets. Sometimes I'm concerned that we hear about it so much that we've come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency  even ease. But make no mistake  longer lives can and  I believe  will improve quality of life at all ages. Now to put this in perspective  let me just zoom out for a minute. More years were added to average life expectancy in the   th century than all years added across all prior millennia of human evolution combined. In the blink of an eye  we nearly doubled the length of time that we're living. So if you ever feel like you don't have this aging thing quite pegged  don't kick yourself. It's brand new. And because fertility rates fell across that very same period that life expectancy was going up  that pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population  with many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people who make it and survive to old age is being reshaped into a rectangle. And now  if you're the kind of person who can get chills from population statistics  these are the ones that should do it. Because what that means is that for the first time in the history of the species  the majority of babies born in the Developed World are having the opportunity to grow old. How did this happen  Well we're no genetically hardier than our ancestors were        years ago. This increase in life expectancy is the remarkable product of culture    the crucible that holds science and technology and wide scale changes in behavior that improve health and well being. Through cultural changes  our ancestors largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives. Now there are problems associated with aging    diseases  poverty  loss of social status. It's hardly time to rest on our laurels. But the more we learn about aging  the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate. Aging brings some rather remarkable improvements    increased knowledge  expertise    and emotional aspects of life improve. That's right  older people are happy. They're happier than middle aged people  and younger people certainly. Study after study is coming to the same conclusion. The CDC recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week. And fewer older people answered affirmatively to that question than middle aged people  and younger people as well. And a recent Gallup poll asked participants how much stress and worry and anger they had experienced the previous day. And stress  worry  anger all decrease with age. Now social scientists call this the paradox of aging. After all  aging is not a piece of cake. So we've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding. We've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people are and always have been the greatest generations. That is that younger people today may not typically experience these improvements as they grow older. We've asked  well maybe older people are just trying to put a positive spin on an otherwise depressing existence. But the more we've tried to disavow this finding  the more evidence we find to support it. Years ago  my colleagues and I embarked on a study where we followed the same group of people over a    year period. Originally the sample was aged    to   . And we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed as they grew older. Our participants would carry electronic pagers for a week at a time  and we'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times. And every time we paged them we'd ask them to answer several questions    On a one to seven scale  how happy are you right now  How sad are you right now  How frustrated are you right now     so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having in their day to day lives. And using this intense study of individuals  we find that it's not one particular generation that's doing better than the others  but the same individuals over time come to report relatively greater positive experience. Now you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages. And there is a slight downturn. But at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood. Now it's really too simplistic to say that older people are  happy.  In our study  they are more positive  but they're also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions    sadness at the same time you experience happiness  you know  that tear in the eye when you're smiling at a friend. And other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness more comfortably. They're more accepting of sadness than younger people are. And we suspect that this may help to explain why older people are better than younger people at solving hotly charged emotional conflicts and debates. Older people can view injustice with compassion  but not despair. And all things being equal  older people direct their cognitive resources  like attention and memory  to positive information more than negative. If we show older  middle aged  younger people images  like the ones you see on the screen  and we later ask them to recall all the images that they can  older people  but not younger people  remember more positive images than negative images. We've asked older and younger people to view faces in laboratory studies  some frowning  some smiling. Older people look toward the smiling faces and away from the frowning  angry faces. In day to day life  this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction. But as social scientists  we continue to ask about possible alternatives. We've said  well maybe older people report more positive emotions because they're cognitively impaired. We've said  could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions  and so you switch to the positive emotions  Maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we're unable to process negative emotions anymore. But that's not the case. The most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect the most. And under conditions where it really matters  older people do process the negative information just as well as the positive information. So how can this be  Well in our research  we've found that these changes are grounded fundamentally in the uniquely human ability to monitor time    not just clock time and calendar time  but lifetime. And if there's a paradox of aging  it's that recognizing that we won't live forever changes our perspective on life in positive ways. When time horizons are long and nebulous  as they typically are in youth  people are constantly preparing  trying to soak up all the information they possibly can  taking risks  exploring. We might spend time with people we don't even like because it's somehow interesting. We might learn something unexpected. We go on blind dates. You know  after all  if it doesn't work out  there's always tomorrow. People over    don't go on blind dates. As we age  our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change. When we recognize that we don't have all the time in the world  we see our priorities most clearly. We take less notice of trivial matters. We savor life. We're more appreciative  more open to reconciliation. We invest in more emotionally important parts of life  and life gets better  so we're happier day to day. But that same shift in perspective leads us to have less tolerance than ever for injustice. By       there will be more people in the United States over the age of    than under   . What will happen to societies that are top heavy with older people  The numbers won't determine the outcome. Culture will. If we invest in science and technology and find solutions for the real problems that older people face and we capitalize on the very real strengths of older people  then added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life at all ages. Societies with millions of talented  emotionally stable citizens who are healthier and better educated than any generations before them  armed with knowledge about the practical matters of life and motivated to solve the big issues can be better societies than we have ever known. My father  who is     likes to say   Let's stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking about how to get them to save us all.  Thank you. Have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque  Probably not  but people like me do. I'm an archeological geneticist at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich  and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans. And through this work  I hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies  so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future. There are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine  and one way is to extract human DNA from ancient bones. And from these extracts  we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations  risk factors and inherited diseases. But this is only one half of the story. The most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome  but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation  diet  microbes and parasites and our immune response. All of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved. And in order to understand these diseases  we need to move past studies of the human genome alone and towards a more holistic approach to human health in the past. But there are a lot of challenges for this. And first of all  what do we even study  Skeletons are ubiquitous  they're found all over the place. But of course  all of the soft tissue has decomposed  and the skeleton itself has limited health information. Mummies are a great source of information  except that they're really geographically limited and limited in time as well. Coprolites are fossilized human feces  and they're actually extremely interesting. You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease  but they are very rare. So to address this problem  I put together a team of international researchers in Switzerland  Denmark and the U.K. to study a very poorly studied  little known material that's found on people everywhere. It's a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus. Many of you may know it by the term tartar. It's what the dentist cleans off your teeth every time that you go in for a visit. And in a typical dentistry visit  you may have about    to    milligrams removed. But in ancient times before tooth brushing  up to     milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime. And what's really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton  it's abundant in quantity before the present day and it's ubiquitous worldwide. We find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years. And we even find it in neanderthals and animals. And so previous studies had only focused on microscopy. They'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope  and what they had found was things like pollen and plant starches  and they'd found muscle cells from animal meats and bacteria. And so what my team of researchers  what we wanted to do  is say  can we apply genetic and proteomic technology to go after DNA and proteins  and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution to really understand what's going on  And what we found is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth. We also have found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and DNA related to diet. But what was surprising to us  and also quite exciting  is we also found bacteria that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems. So it gives us virtual access to the lungs  which is where many important diseases reside. And we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut. And so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that  from the skeleton alone  has long decomposed. And so by applying ancient DNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus  we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet  infection and immunity thousands of years ago. So what started out as an idea  is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long term evolutionary history of human health and disease  right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens. And from this information we can learn about how pathogens evolve and also why they continue to make us sick. And I hope I have convinced you of the value of dental calculus. And as a final parting thought  on behalf of future archeologists  I would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth. Thank you. A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever. And today  after briefly describing what they found  I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery  namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth  the Milky Way and other distant galaxies  we may find that our universe is not the only universe  but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse. Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one. I mean  most of us were raised to believe that the word  universe  means everything. And I say most of us with forethought  as my four year old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born. And last year I was holding her and I said   Sophia  I love you more than anything in the universe.  And she turned to me and said   Daddy  universe or multiverse   But barring such an anomalous upbringing  it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours  most with fundamentally different features  that would rightly be called universes of their own. And yet  speculative though the idea surely is  I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously  as it just might be right. I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts. In part one  I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed. In part two  I'll offer a solution to that mystery. It's based on an approach called string theory  and that's where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story. Finally  in part three  I'm going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation  which will pull all the pieces of the story together. Okay  part one starts back in      when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us  establishing that space itself is stretching  it's expanding. Now this was revolutionary. The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static. But even so  there was one thing that everyone was certain of  The expansion must be slowing down. That  much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward  the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space. Now let's fast forward to the     s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing. And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies  allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time. Here's the surprise  They found that the expansion is not slowing down. Instead they found that it's speeding up  going faster and faster. That's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster. Now if you saw an apple do that  you'd want to know why. What's pushing on it  Similarly  the astronomers' results are surely well deserving of the Nobel Prize  but they raised an analogous question. What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever quickening speed  Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein's. You see  we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing  pulls objects together. But in Einstein's theory of gravity  his general theory of relativity  gravity can also push things apart. How  Well according to Einstein's math  if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy  sort of like a uniform  invisible mist  then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive  repulsive gravity  which is just what we need to explain the observations. Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space    we now call it dark energy  but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it    its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other  driving expansion to speed up  not slow down. And this explanation represents great progress. But I promised you a mystery here in part one. Here it is. When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up  look at what they found. This number is small. Expressed in the relevant unit  it is spectacularly small. And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number. We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics  but so far no one has found a way to do that. Now you might wonder  should you care  Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue  a technical detail of interest to experts  but of no relevance to anybody else. Well it surely is a technical detail  but some details really matter. Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality  and this peculiar number may be doing just that  as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes    an idea that naturally emerges from string theory  which takes me to part two  string theory. So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory. First off  what is it  Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream of a unified theory of physics  a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe. And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward. It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely  at first you'll find molecules and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles. But the theory says that if you could probe smaller  much smaller than we can with existing technology  you'd find something else inside these particles    a little tiny vibrating filament of energy  a little tiny vibrating string. And just like the strings on a violin  they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes. These little fundamental strings  when they vibrate in different patterns  they produce different kinds of particles    so electrons  quarks  neutrinos  photons  all other particles would be united into a single framework  as they would all arise from vibrating strings. It's a compelling picture  a kind of cosmic symphony  where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little  tiny strings can play. But there's a cost to this elegant unification  because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work. It has internal inconsistencies  unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar    extra dimensions of space. That is  we all know about the usual three dimensions of space. And you can think about those as height  width and depth. But string theory says that  on fantastically small scales  there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them. But even though the dimensions are hidden  they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate. And in string theory  vibration determines everything. So particle masses  the strengths of forces  and most importantly  the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions. So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions  we should be able to calculate these features  calculate the amount of dark energy. The challenge is we don't know the shape of the extra dimensions. All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math. Now when these ideas were first developed  there were only about five different candidate shapes  so you can imagine analyzing them one by one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe. But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes. From five  the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands    A large  but still manageable  collection to analyze  since after all  graduate students need something to do. But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions  until today. The list of candidate shapes has soared to about    to the    . So  what to do  Well some researchers lost heart  concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions  each giving rise to different physical features  string theory would never make definitive  testable predictions. But others turned this issue on its head  taking us to the possibility of a multiverse. Here's the idea. Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other. Each is as real as every other  in the sense that there are many universes  each with a different shape  for the extra dimensions. And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery  the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize winning results. Because you see  if there are other universes  and if those universes each have  say  a different shape for the extra dimensions  then the physical features of each universe will be different  and in particular  the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different. Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured would take on a wholly different character. In this context  the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn't just one number  there are many numbers. Which means we have been asking the wrong question. It's that the right question to ask is  why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there  And that's a question on which we can make headway. Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours  whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies  the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don't form. And in those universes that have much less dark energy  well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that  again  galaxies don't form. And without galaxies  there are no stars  no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes. So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life. And that would be that. Mystery solved  multiverse found. Now some find this explanation unsatisfying. We're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe. But the point is  if the feature you're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality  then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided. An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number    why the Sun is    million miles away from the Earth. And he worked for decades trying to explain this number  but he never succeeded  and we know why. Kepler was asking the wrong question. We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars. So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number     million miles  well that is simply wrongheaded. Instead the right question to ask is  why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance  instead of any of the other possibilities  And again  that's a question we can answer. Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn't exist. And those planets that are much farther away from the star  well they're so cold that  again  our form of life would not take hold. So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life. And when it comes to planets and their distances  this clearly is the right kind of reasoning. The point is  when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain  it may also be the right kind of reasoning. One key difference  of course  is we know that there are other planets out there  but so far I've only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes. So to pull it all together  we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes. And that takes me to my final part  part three. Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang. You see  when we speak of the Big Bang  we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward. But there's a little secret. The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important  the Bang. It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang  but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself. And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory. It's called inflationary cosmology  which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space. The fuel is based on something called a quantum field  but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up  which means in the inflationary theory  the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one time event. Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang  but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs  each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes. And now  when we meld this with string theory  here's the picture we're led to. Each of these universes has extra dimensions. The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes. The different shapes yield different physical features. And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it's only in our universe that the physical features  like the amount of dark energy  are right for our form of life to take hold. And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider. One big remaining question  of course  is  could we ever confirm the existence of other universes  Well let me describe one way that might one day happen. The inflationary theory already has strong observational support. Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded  tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world  yielding a distinctive fingerprint  a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots  across space  which powerful telescopes have now observed. Going further  if there are other universes  the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide. And if our universe got hit by another  that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect. And so exotic as this picture is  it may one day be grounded in observations  establishing the existence of other universes. I'll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future. You see  we learned that our universe is not static  that space is expanding  that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies. But because the expansion is speeding up  in the very far future  those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won't be able to see them    not because of technological limitations  but because of the laws of physics. The light those galaxies emit  even traveling at the fastest speed  the speed of light  will not be able to overcome the ever widening gulf between us. So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static  inky  black stillness. And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit    a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong. Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era  like ours  attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies. But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge  Or would they believe in the black  static empty universe that their own state of the art observations reveal  I suspect the latter. Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration. It appears that it may not always be that way. Because today's astronomers  by turning powerful telescopes to the sky  have captured a handful of starkly informative photons    a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. and the message echoing across the ages is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Brian  thank you. The range of ideas you've just spoken about are dizzying  exhilarating  incredible. How do you think of where cosmology is now  in a sort of historical side  Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion  BG  Well it's hard to say. When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out  the natural question is  maybe we're already in that position and certain deep  critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves. So from that perspective  maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them. On the other hand  we now can understand how old the universe is. We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down   .   billion years ago    and yet  we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches. Holy cow  That's just amazing. So on the one hand  it's just incredible where we've gotten  but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future. CA  You're going to be around for the next few days. Maybe some of these conversations can continue. Thank you. Thank you  Brian.  BG  My pleasure.  So I want to talk today about money and happiness  which are two things that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about  either trying to earn them or trying to increase them. And a lot of us resonate with this phrase. So we see it in religions and self help books  that money can't buy happiness. And I want to suggest today that  in fact  that's wrong. I'm at a business school  so that's what we do. So that's wrong  and  in fact  if you think that  you're actually just not spending it right. So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it  maybe if you spent it differently  that might work a little bit better. And before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier  let's think about the ways we usually spend it that don't  in fact  make us happier. We had a little natural experiment. So CNN  a little while ago  wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery. It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing. This article's about how their lives get ruined. So what happens when people win the lottery is  number one  they spend all the money and go into debt  and number two  all of their friends and everyone they've ever met find them and bug them for money. And it ruins their social relationships  in fact. So they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery. What was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article  readers of the thing. And instead of talking about how it had made them realize that money doesn't lead to happiness  everyone instantly started saying   You know what I would do if I won the lottery ...    and fantasizing about what they'd do. And here's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about. One person wrote in   When I win  I'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top.  And another person wrote   I would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne.  This is even worse now   Then I'd have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made. Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else.  And so many of the comments were exactly of this type  where people got money and  in fact  it made them antisocial. So I told you that it ruins people's lives and that their friends bug them. It also  money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves. Well maybe the reason that money doesn't make us happy is that we're always spending it on the wrong things  and in particular  that we're always spending it on ourselves. And we thought  I wonder what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on other people. So instead of being antisocial with your money  what if you were a little more prosocial with your money  And we thought  let's make people do it and see what happens. So let's have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves  and let's make some people give money away  and measure their happiness and see if  in fact  they get happier. So the first way that we did this. On one Vancouver morning  we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said   Do you want to be in an experiment   They said   Yes.  We asked them how happy they were  and then we gave them an envelope. And one of the envelopes had things in it that said   By      pm today  spend this money on yourself.  So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on. Other people  in the morning  got a slip of paper that said   By      pm today  spend this money on somebody else.  Also inside the envelope was money. And we manipulated how much money we gave them. So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars. Some people got this slip of paper and    dollars. We let them go about their day. They did whatever they wanted to do. We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to. We called them up at night and asked them   What'd you spend it on  and how happy do you feel now   What did they spend it on  Well these are college undergrads  so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup. One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece. People gave money to homeless people. Huge effect here of Starbucks. So if you give undergraduates five dollars  it looks like coffee to them and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can. But some people bought a coffee for themselves  the way they usually would  but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else. So the very same purchase  just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else. What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day  People who spent money on other people got happier. People who spent money on themselves  nothing happened. It didn't make them less happy  it just didn't do much for them. And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter that much. So people thought that    dollars would be way better than five dollars. In fact  it doesn't matter how much money you spent. What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself. We see this again and again when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves. Of course  these are undergraduates in Canada    not the world's most representative population. They're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things. We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries. So we went  in fact  to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment. So imagine  instead of just people in Canada  we said   Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people. Describe it. How happy did it make you   Or in Uganda   Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that.  And then we asked them how happy they are again. And what we see is sort of amazing because there's human universals on what you do with your money and then real cultural differences on what you do as well. So for example  one guy from Uganda says this. He said   I called a girl I wished to love.  They basically went out on a date  and he says at the end that he didn't  achieve  her up till now. Here's a guy from Canada. Very similar thing.  I took my girlfriend out for dinner. We went to a movie  we left early  and then went back to her room for ...   only cake    just a piece of cake. Human universal    so you spend money on other people  you're being nice to them. Maybe you have something in mind  maybe not. But then we see extraordinary differences. So look at these two. This is a woman from Canada. We say   Name a time you spent money on somebody else.  She says   I bought a present for my mom. I drove to the mall in my car  bought a present  gave it to my mom.  Perfectly nice thing to do. It's good to get gifts for people that you know. Compare that to this woman from Uganda.  I was walking and met a long time friend whose son was sick with malaria. They had no money  they went to a clinic and I gave her this money.  This isn't          it's the local currency. So it's a very small amount of money  in fact. But enormously different motivations here. This is a real medical need  literally a life saving donation. Above  it's just kind of  I bought a gift for my mother. What we see again though is that the specific way that you spend on other people isn't nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy  which is really quite important. So you don't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy. You can do small  trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this. These are only two countries. We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between money and happiness. We got data from the Gallup Organization  which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately. They ask people   Did you donate money to charity recently   and they ask them   How happy are you with your life in general   And we can see what the relationship is between those two things. Are they positively correlated  Giving money makes you happy. Or are they negatively correlated  On this map  green will mean they're positively correlated and red means they're negatively correlated. And you can see  the world is crazily green. So in almost every country in the world where we have this data  people who give money to charity are happier people that people who don't give money to charity. I know you're all looking at that red country in the middle. I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is  but in fact  it's Central African Republic. You can make up stories. Maybe it's different there for some reason or another. Just below that to the right is Rwanda though  which is amazingly green. So almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself. What about your work life  which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we're not with the people we know. We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing. So these are sales teams in Belgium. They work in teams  they go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs. So we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team. Some teams  we give people on the team some money for themselves and say   Spend it however you want on yourself   just like we did with the undergrads in Canada. But other teams we say   Here's    euro. Spend it on one of your teammates this week. Buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them. And then we can see  well now we've got teams that spend on themselves and we've got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better. The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata  and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that. A very silly  trivial thing to do  but think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all  that got    euro  put it in their pocket  maybe bought themselves a coffee  or teams that had this prosocial experience where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity. What we see is that  in fact  the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves. And one way to think about it is for every    euro you give people for themselves  they put it in their pocket  they don't do anything different than they did before. You don't get any money from that. You actually lose money because it doesn't motivate them to perform any better. But when you give them    euro to spend on their teammates  they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money. And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves  this is all fine  but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy and I can't imagine it would work there. And basically that if he doesn't show me that it works here  I don't believe anything he said. And I know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams. This was a huge criticism that we got to say  if you can't show it with dodgeball teams  this is all stupid. So we went out and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them. And we did the exact same thing as before. So some teams  we give people on the team money  they spend it on themselves. Other teams  we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates. The teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before. The teams that we give the money to spend on each other  they become different teams and  in fact  they dominate the league by the time they're done. Across all of these different contexts    your personal life  you work life  even silly things like intramural sports    we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending on yourself. And so I'll just say  I think if you think money can't buy happiness you're not spending it right. The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that's the way to make yourself happier. It's in fact  that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself and try giving some of it to other people instead. And we luckily have an opportunity for you. DonorsChoose.org is a non profit for mainly public school teachers in low income schools. They post projects  so they say   I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don't have the books   or  I want a microscope to teach my students science and we don't have a microscope.  You and I can go on and buy it for them. The teacher writes you a thank you note. The kids write you a thank you note. Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope. It's an extraordinary thing. Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking  again  less about  How can I spend money on myself   and more about  If I've got five dollars or    dollars  what can I do to benefit other people   Because ultimately when you do that  you'll find that you'll benefit yourself much more. Thank you. It's a great honor to be here. It's a great honor to be here talking about cities  talking about the future of cities. It's great to be here as a mayor. I really do believe that mayors have the political position to really change people's lives. That's the place to be. And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio. Rio's a beautiful city  a vibrant place  special place. Actually  you're looking at a guy who has the best job in the world. And I really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of Rio. the envelope containing the result. Jacques Rogge  I have the honor to announce that the games of the   st Olympiad are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro. EP  Okay  that's very touching  very emotional  but it was not easy to get there. Actually it was a very hard challenge. We had to beat the European monarchy. This is Juan Carlos  king of Spain. We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology. We had to beat the most powerful man in the world defending his own city. So it was not easy at all. And actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that I think fits perfectly to the situation of Rio winning the Olympic bid. We really showed that  yes  we can. And really  this is the reason I came here tonight. I came here tonight to tell you that things can be done  that you don't have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way  that cities are a great challenge. It's a difficult task to deal with cities. But with some original ways of getting things done  with some basic commandments  you can really get cities to be a great  great place to live. I want you all to imagine Rio. You probably think about a city full of energy  a vibrant city full of green. And nobody showed that better than Carlos Saldanha in last year's  Rio.  EP  Okay  some parts of Rio are pretty much like that  but it's not like that everywhere. We're like every big city in the world. We've got lots of people  pollution  cars  concrete  lots of concrete. These pictures I'm showing here  they are some pictures from Madureira. It's like the heart of the suburb in Rio. And I want to use an example of Rio that we're doing in Madureira  in this region  to see what we should think as our first commandment. So every time you see a concrete jungle like that  what you've got to do is find open spaces. If you don't have open spaces  you've got to go there and open spaces. So go inside these open spaces and make it that people can get inside and use those spaces. This is going to be the third largest park in Rio by June this year. It's going to be a place where people can meet  where you can put nature. The temperature's going to drop two  three degrees centigrade. So the first commandment I want to leave you tonight is  a city of the future has to be environmentally friendly. Every time you think of a city  you've got to think green. You've got to think green and green. So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you. Let's think that cities are made of people  lots of people together. cities are packed with people. So how do you move these people around  When you have  .  billion people living in cities    by       it's going to be   billion people. So every time you think about moving these people around  you think about high capacity transportation. But there is a problem. High capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money. So what I'm going to show here is something that was already presented in TED by the former mayor of Curitiba who created that  a city in Brazil  Jaime Lerner. And it's something that we're doing  again  lots in Rio. It's the BRT  the Bus Rapid Transit. So you get a bus. It's a simple bus that everybody knows. You transform it inside as a train car. You use separate lanes  dedicated lanes. The contractors  they don't like that. You don't have to dig deep down underground. You can build nice stations. This is actually a station that we're doing in Rio. Again  you don't have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that. This station has the same comfort  the same features as a subway station. A kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway. So spending much less money and doing it much faster  you can really change the way people move. This is a map of Rio. All the lines  the colored lines you see there  it's our high capacity transportation network. In this present time today  we only carry    percent of our population in high capacity transportation. With the BRTs we're doing  again  the cheapest and fastest way  we're going to move to    percent of the population being carried by high capacity transportation. So remember what I said  You don't always have to be rich or powerful to get things done. You can find original ways to get things done. So the second commandment I want to leave you tonight is  a city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration of its people. Moving to the third commandment. And this is the most controversial one. It has to do with the favelas  the slums    whatever you call it  there are different names all over the world. But the point we want to make here tonight is  favelas are not always a problem. I mean  favelas can sometimes really be a solution  if you deal with them  if you put public policy inside the favelas. Let me just show a map of Rio again. Rio has  .  million inhabitants    More than    percent   .  million  live in the favelas. All these red parts are favelas. So you see  they are spread all over the city. This is a typical view of a favela in Rio. You see the contrast between the rich and poor. So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas. The first one is  you can change from what I call a  vicious  circle to a virtual circle. But what you've got to do to get that is you've got to go inside the favelas  bring in the basic services    mainly education and health    with high quality. I'm going to give a fast example here. This was an old building in a favela in Rio     unclear favela name     that we just transformed into a primary school  with high quality. This is primary assistance in health that we built inside a favela  again  with high quality. We call it a family clinic. So the first point is bring basic services inside the favelas with high quality. The second point I want to make about the favelas is  you've got to open spaces in the favela. Bring infrastructure to the favelas  to the slums  wherever you are. Rio has the aim  by       to have all its favelas completely urbanized. Another example  this was completely packed with houses  and then we built this  what we call  a knowledge square. This is a place with high technology where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place can go inside and have access to all technology. We even built a theater there     D movie. And this is the kind of change you can get for that. And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize  which is this great laugh from a kid that lives in the favela. So the third commandment I want to leave here tonight is  a city of the future has to be socially integrated. You cannot deal with a city if it's not socially integrated. But moving to our fourth commandment  I really wouldn't be here tonight. Between November and May  Rio's completely packed. We just had last week Carnivale. It was great. It was lots of fun. We have New Year's Eve. There's like two million people on Copacabana Beach. We have problems. We fight floods  tropical rains at this time of the year. You can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes. We have problems with the tropical rains. Almost every year we have these landslides  which are terrible. But the reason I could come here is because of that. This was something we did with IBM that's a little bit more than a year old. It's what we call the Operations Center of Rio. And I wanted to show that I can govern my city  using technology  from here  from Long Beach  so I got here last night and I know everything. We're going to speak now to the Operations Center. This is Osorio  he's our secretary of urban affairs. So Osorio  good to be there with you. I've already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year. So how's the weather in Rio now  Osorio  The weather is fine. We have fair weather today. Let me get you our weather satellite radar. You see just a little bit of moisture around the city. Absolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather  today and in the next few days. EP  Okay  how's the traffic  We  at this time of year  get lots of traffic jams. People get mad at the mayor. So how's the traffic tonight  Osario  Well traffic tonight is fine. Let me get you one of our       buses. A live transmission in downtown Rio for you  Mr. Mayor. You see  the streets are clear. Now it's       pm in Rio. Nothing of concern in terms of traffic. I'll get to you now the incidents of the day. We had heavy traffic early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon  but nothing of big concern. We are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city. EP  Okay  so you're showing now some public services. These are the cars. Osorio  Absolutely  Mr. Mayor. Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks. This is live transmission. We have GPS's in all of our trucks. And you can see them working in all parts of the city. Waste collection on time. Public services working well. EP  Okay  Osorio  thank you very much. It was great to have you here. We're going to move so that I can make a conclusion. Okay  so no files  this place  no paperwork  no distance       working. So the fourth commandment I want to share with you here tonight is  a city of the future has to use technology to be present. I don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city. But everything that I said here tonight  or the commandments  are means  are ways  for us to govern cities    invest in infrastructure  invest in the green  open parks  open spaces  integrate socially  use technology. But at the end of the day  when we talk about cities  we talk about a gathering of people. And we cannot see that as a problem. That is fantastic. If there's  .  billion now  it's going to be six billion then it's going to be    billion. That is great  that means we're going to have    billion minds working together     billion talents together. So a city of the future  I really do believe that it's a city that cares about its citizens  integrates socially its citizens. A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party  which are cities. Thank you very much. To most of you  this is a device to buy  sell  play games  watch videos. I think it might be a lifeline. I think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin. Texting  I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting  a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see    hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else    or trying to translate the abbreviations LOL  LMAO  HMU. I can help you with those later. But the parents in the room know that texting is actually the best way to communicate with your kids. It might be the only way to communicate with your kids. The average teenager sends       text messages a month  unless she's a girl  then it's closer to      . And the secret is she opens every single one. Texting has a     percent open rate. Now the parents are really alarmed. It's a     percent open rate even if she doesn't respond to you when you ask her when she's coming home for dinner. I promise she read that text. And this isn't some suburban iPhone using teen phenomenon. Texting actually overindexes for minority and urban youth. I know this because at DoSomething.org  which is the largest organization for teenagers and social change in America  about six months ago we pivoted and started focusing on text messaging. We're now texting out to about         kids a week about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green or to work on homeless issues and things like that. We're finding it    times more powerful than email. We've also found an unintended consequence. We've been getting text messages back like these.  I don't want to go to school today. The boys call me faggot.   I was cutting  my parents found out  and so I stopped. But I just started again an hour ago.  Or   He won't stop raping me. He told me not to tell anyone. It's my dad. Are you there   That last one's an actual text message that we received. And yeah  we're there. I will not forget the day we got that text message. And so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline. Because this isn't what we do. We do social change. Kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there's nowhere else to turn that they're sending them to us. So think about it  a text hotline  it's pretty powerful. It's fast  it's pretty private. No one hears you in a stall  you're just texting quietly. It's real time. We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals. That's great. But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data. Because I'm not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals. I want to prevent this shit from happening. So think about a cop. There's something in New York City. The police did it. It used to be just guess work  police work. And then they started crime mapping. And so they started following and watching petty thefts  summonses  all kinds of things    charting the future essentially. And they found things like  when you see crystal meth on the street  if you add police presence  you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen. In fact  the year after the NYPD put CompStat in place  the murder rate fell    percent. So think about the data from a crisis text line. There is no census on bullying and dating abuse and eating disorders and cutting and rape    no census. Maybe there's some studies  some longitudinal studies  that cost lots of money and took lots of time. Or maybe there's some anecdotal evidence. Imagine having real time data on every one of those issues. You could inform legislation. You could inform school policy. You could say to a principal   You're having a problem every Thursday at three o'clock. What's going on in your school   You could see the immediate impact of legislation or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result. This is really  to me  the power of texting and the power of data. Because while people are talking about data  making it possible for Facebook to mine my friend from the third grade  or Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers  or some dude to build a better baseball team  I'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting to help that kid go to school  to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom and absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her. Thank you. Five hundred seventy one million two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels are used by Americans every year. If we could    correction  wrong figure       billion used every year. If we could reduce the usage of paper towels  one paper towel per person per day              pounds of paper not used. We can do that. Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers. There's the tri fold. People typically take two or three. There's the one that cuts it  that you have to tear off. People go one  two  three  four  tear. This much  right  There's the one that cuts itself. People go  one  two  three  four. Or there's the same thing  but recycled paper  you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbant  of course. The fact is  you can do it all with one towel. The key  two words  This half of the room  your word is  shake.  Let's hear it. Shake. Louder. Audience  Shake. Joe Smith  Your word is  fold.  Audience  Fold. JS  Again. Audience  Fold. JS  Really loud. Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Okay. Wet hands. Shake    one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine            . Why     Twelve apostles  twelve tribes  twelve zodiac signs  twelve months. The one I like the best  It's the biggest number with one syllable. Tri fold. Fold ... Dry. Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important because it allows interstitial suspension. You don't have to remember that part  but trust me. Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Cuts itself. You know the funny thing is  I get my hands drier than people do with three or four  because they can't get in between the cracks. If you think this isn't as good... Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Now  there's now a real fancy invention  it's the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out. It's way too big a towel. Let me tell you a secret. If you're really quick  if you're really quick    and I can prove this    this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building. How  As soon as it starts  you just tear it off. It's smart enough to stop. And you get half a towel. Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Now  let's all say it together. Shake. Fold. You will for the rest of your life remember those words every time you pick up a paper towel. And remember  one towel per person for one year                pounds of paper. No small thing. And next year  toilet paper. When we think of games  there's all kinds of things. Maybe you're ticked off  or maybe you're looking forward to a new game. You've been up too late playing a game. All these things happen to me. But when we think about games  a lot of times we think about stuff like this  first person shooters  or the big  what we would call AAA games  or maybe you're a Facebook game player. This is one my partner and I worked on. Maybe you play Facebook games  and that's what we're making right now. This is a lighter form of game. Maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations. This would be one of those tragically boring board games that you can figure out. Or maybe you're in your living room  you know  playing with the Wii with the kids  or something like that  and  you know  there's this whole range of games  and that's very much what I think about. I make my living from games. I've been lucky enough to do this since I was     which also qualifies as I've never really had a real job. But we think about games as fun  and that's completely reasonable  but let's just think about this. So this one here  this is the      Olympics. Now I don't know where you guys were  but I was in my living room. It was practically a religious event. And this is when the Americans beat the Russians  and this was    yes  it was technically a game. Hockey is a game. But really  was this a game  I mean  people cried. I've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly. And so this was just an amazing experience. Or  you know  if anybody here is from Boston    So when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series after  I believe      years  when they won the World Series  it was amazing. I happened to be living in Springfield at the time  and the best part of it was    is that    you would close the women's door in the bathroom  and I remember seeing  Go Sox   and I thought  really  Or the houses  you'd come out  because every game  well  I think almost every game  went into overtime  right  So we'd be outside  and all the other lights are on on the whole block  and kids  like  the attendance was down in school  and kids weren't going to school. But it's okay  it's the Red Sox  right  I mean  there's education  and then there's the Red Sox  and we know where they're stacked. So this was an amazing experience  and again  yes  it was a game  but they didn't write newspaper articles  people didn't say    you know  really   I can die now because the Red Sox won.  And many people did. So games  it means something more to us. It absolutely means something more. So now  just  this is an abrupt transition here. There was three years where I actually did have a real job  sort of. I was the head of a college department teaching games  so  again  it was sort of a real job  and now I just got to talk about making as opposed to making them. And I was at a dinner. Part of the job of it  when you're a chair of a department  is to eat  and I did that very well  and so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson. So this is Zig in this photograph. This is also one of Zig's photographs. He's a photographer. And he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself  and you can see here he's got Zig's Indian Reservation. And this particular shot  this is one of the more traditional shots. This is a rain dancer. And this is one of my favorite shots here. So you can look at this  and maybe you've even seen things like this. This is an expression of culture  right  And this is actually from his Degradation series. And what was most fascinating to me about this series is just  look at that little boy there. Can you imagine  Now let's  we can see that's a traditional Native American. Now I just want to change that guy's race. Just imagine if that's a black guy. So   Honey  come here  let's get your picture with the black guy.  Right  Like  seriously  nobody would do this. It baffles the mind. And so Zig  being Indian  likewise it baffles his mind. His favorite photograph    my favorite photograph of his  which I don't have in here is Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians.  Laughter  So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer  and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred  and it was on an Indian reservation. He'd taken his camera up there to photograph it  but when he got there  he discovered he couldn't do it. He just couldn't capture the picture. And so they were talking back and forth about this question. Do you take the picture or not  And that was fascinating to me as a game designer  because it never occurs to me  like  should I make the game about this difficult topic or not  Because we just make things that are fun or  you know  will make you feel fear  you know  that visceral excitement. But every other medium does it. So this is my kid. This is Maezza  and when she was seven years old  she came home from school one day  and like I do every single day  I asked her   What'd you do today   So she said   We talked about the Middle Passage.  Now  this was a big moment. Maezza's dad is black  and I knew this day was coming. I wasn't expecting it at seven. I don't know why  but I wasn't. Anyways  so I asked her   How do you feel about that   So she proceeded to tell me  and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here. So the ships start in England  they come down from England  they go to Africa  they go across the ocean    that's the Middle Passage part   they come to America where the slaves are sold  she's telling me. But Abraham Lincoln was elected president  and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation  and now they're free. Pause for about    seconds.  Can I play a game  Mommy   And I thought  that's it  And so  you know  this is the Middle Passage  this is an incredibly significant event  and she's treating it like  basically some black people went on a cruise  is more or less how it sounds to her.  Laughter  And so  to me  I wanted more value in this  so when she asked if she could play a game  I said   Yes.   Laughter  And so I happened to have all of these little pieces. I'm a game designer  so I have this stuff sitting around my house. So I said   Yeah  you can play a game   and I give her a bunch of these  and I tell her to paint them in different families. These are pictures of Maezza when she was   God  it still chokes me up seeing these. So she's painting her little families. So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat. This was the boat. It was made quickly obviously.  Laughter  And so the basic gist of it is  I grabbed a bunch of families  and she's like   Mommy  but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things.  And she says   They want to go.  And I said   Honey  no they don't want to go. This is the Middle Passage. Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage.  So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother  and as we're going across the ocean  following these rules  she realizes that she's rolling pretty high  and she says to me   We're not going to make it.  And she realizes  you know  we don't have enough food  and so she asks what to do  and I say   Well  we can either     Remember  she's seven     We can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don't get sick and we make it to the other side.  And she    just the look on her face came over and she said    now mind you this is after a month of    this is Black History Month  right  After a month she says to me   Did this really happen   And I said   Yes.  And so she said   So  if I came out of the woods    this is her brother and sister    If I came out of the woods  Avalon and Donovan might be gone.   Yes.   But I'd get to see them in America.   No.   But what if I saw them  You know  couldn't we stay together    No.   So Daddy could be gone.   Yes.  And she was fascinated by this  and she started to cry  and I started to cry  and her father started to cry  and now we're all crying. He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage  but there it goes.  Laughter  And so  we made this game  and she got it. She got it because she spent time with these people. It wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie. And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience. This is the game  which I've ended up calling The New World  because I like the phrase. I don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships. But when this happened  I saw the whole planet. I was so excited. It was like  I'd been making games for    some years  and then I decided to do it again. My history is Irish. So this is a game called S och n Leat. It's  peace be with you.  It's the entire history of my family in a single game. I made another game called Train. I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics  and if you're going to cover a difficult topic  this is one you need to cover  and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own. And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears. This is a game with        individual pieces. I was crazy when I decided to start it  but I'm in the middle of it now. It's the same thing. I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games. And the one I'm working on right now  which is    because I'm right in the middle of it  and these for some reason choke me up like crazy    is a game called Mexican Kitchen Workers. And originally it was a math problem more or less. Like  here's the economics of illegal immigration. And the more I learned about the Mexican culture    my partner is Mexican   the more I learned that  you know  for all of us  food is a basic need  but  and it is obviously with Mexicans too  but it's much more than that. It's an expression of love. It's an expression of   God  I'm totally choking up way more than I thought. I'll look away from the picture. It's an expression of beauty. It's how they say they love you. It's how they say they care  and you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother without saying  food  in the first sentence. And so to me  this beautiful culture  this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games. And so games  for a change  it changes how we see topics  it changes how our perceptions about those people in topics  and it changes ourselves. We change as people through games  because we're involved  and we're playing  and we're learning as we do so. Thank you.  Applause  We conventionally divide space into private and public realms  and we know these legal distinctions very well because we've become experts at protecting our private property and private space. But we're less attuned to the nuances of the public. What translates generic public space into qualitative space  I mean  this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade. And we're doing this through some case studies. A large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post industrial space that looks forward and backward at the same time. And another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that's grown out of sync with its time. We've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn't usually have      to spend on an opera ticket. So we've been eating  drinking  thinking  living public space for quite a long time. And it's taught us really one thing  and that is to truly make good public space  you have to erase the distinctions between architecture  urbanism  landscape  media design and so on. It really goes beyond distinction. Now we're moving onto Washington  D.C. and we're working on another transformation  and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that's sited on the most revered public space in America  the National Mall. The Mall is a symbol of American democracy. And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing  it's not an image  it's not an artifact  actually it's a space  and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side. It's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power. It's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place. And they're inscribed in there forever    like the march on Washington for jobs and freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there. The Vietnam protests  the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS  the march for women's reproductive rights  right up until almost the present. The Mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent. And it's synonymous with free speech  even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say. It may just be a place for civic commiseration. There is a huge disconnect  we believe  between the communicative and discursive space of the Mall and the museums that line it to either side. And that is that those museums are usually passive  they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience  as the receiver of information. And so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that  but you're really not involved  you're being talked to. When Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn in       he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place  at the seat of power in the U.S. And while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time  there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness. The question is  is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs  And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy  There are over     embassies in Washington D.C. There are over     think tanks. There should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into  and somehow through  the museum. There should be some kind of brain trust. So the Hirshhorn  as we began to think about it  and as we evolved the mission  with Richard and his team    it's really his life blood. But beyond exhibiting contemporary art  the Hirshhorn will become a public forum  a place of discourse for issues around arts  culture  politics and policy. It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum. It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference. It would have the informality of the town square. And for this new initiative  the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary  deployable structure. This is it. This is the Hirshhorn    so a     foot diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early '  s by Gordon Bunshaft. It's hulking  it's silent  it's cloistered  it's arrogant  it's a design challenge. Architects love to hate it. One redeeming feature is it's lifted up off the ground and it's got this void  and it's got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style. And around that space  the ring is actually galleries. Very  very difficult to mount shows in there. When the Hirshhorn opened  Ada Louise Huxstable  the New York Times critic  had some choice words   Neo penitentiary modern.   A maimed monument and a maimed Mall for a maimed collection.  Almost four decades later  how will this building expand for a new progressive program  Where would it go  It can't go in the Mall. There is no space there. It can't go in the courtyard. It's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures. Well there's always the hole. But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly  How could it become iconic  And what language would it take  The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall's monumental institutions. Most are neoclassical  heavy and opaque  made of stone or concrete. And the question is  if one inhabits that space  what is the material of the Mall  It has to be different from the buildings there. It has to be something entirely different. It has to be air. In our imagination  it has to be light. It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless. And it has to be free. So this is the big idea. It's a giant airbag. The expansion takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can    the top and sides. But more poetically  we like to think of the structure as inhaling the democratic air of the Mall  bringing it into itself. The before and the after. It was dubbed  the bubble  by the press. That was the lounge. It's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction. The membrane is translucent. It's made of silcon coated glass fiber. And it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time. This is the view from the inside. So you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government. It had to be approved by actually two agencies. And one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of the Mall. I blush whenever I show this. It is yours to interpret. But one thing I can say is that it's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration. There was also some creative interpretation involved. The Congressional Buildings Act of      limits the height of buildings in D.C. to     feet  except for spires  towers  domes and minarets. This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state. And the bubble is     ft. That's the Pantheon next to it. It's about  .  million cubic feet of compressed air. And so we argued it on the merits of being a dome. So there it is  very stately  among all the stately buildings in the Mall. And while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked  it's very  very historically sensitive. And so we couldn't really touch its surfaces. We couldn't leave any traces behind. So we strained it from the edges  and we held it by cables. It's a study of some bondage techniques  which are actually very important because it's hit by wind all the time. There's one permanent steel ring at the top  but it can't be seen from any vantage point on the Mall. There are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit. It glows from within  it's translucent. But it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments. So it's down the hierarchy on lighting. So it comes to the site twice a year. It's taken off the delivery truck. It's hoisted. And then it's inflated with this low pressure air. And then it's restrained with the cables. And then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom. This is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall how much time would it take to install. And we said  well the first erection would take one week. And they really connected with that idea. And then it was really easy all the way through. So we didn't really have that many hurdles  I have to say  with the government and all the authorities. But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones. This is the warp and weft. This is a point cloud. There are extreme pressures. This is a very  very unusual building in that there's no gravity load  but there's load in every direction. And I'm just going to zip through these slides. And this is the space in action. So flexible interior for discussions  just like this  but in the round    luminous and reconfigurable. Could be used for anything  for performances  films  for installations. And the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations. Form and content are together here. The bubble is an anti monument. The ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity. Art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls  but inside of the museum's core  blending its air with the democratic air of the Mall. And the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of     . Thank you.
