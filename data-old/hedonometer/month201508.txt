For the past decade  I've been studying non state armed groups  armed organizations like terrorists  insurgents or militias. I document what these groups do when they're not shooting. My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation. I work in the field  in the policy world and in the library. Understanding non state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict  because war has changed. It used to be a contest between states. No longer. It is now a conflict between states and non state actors. For example  of the     peace agreements signed between      and           of them were between a state and a non state actor. So we need to understand these groups  we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful. So how do we do that  We need to know what makes these organizations tick. We know a lot about how they fight  why they fight  but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting. Yet  armed struggle and unarmed politics are related. It is all part of the same organization. We cannot understand these groups  let alone defeat them  if we don't have the full picture. And armed groups today are complex organizations. Take the Lebanese Hezbollah  known for its violent confrontation against Israel. But since its creation in the early     s  Hezbollah has also set up a political party  a social service network  and a military apparatus. Similarly  the Palestinian Hamas  known for its suicide attacks against Israel  also runs the Gaza Strip since     . So these groups do way more than just shoot. They multi task. They set up complex communication machines    radio stations  TV channels  Internet websites and social media strategies. And up here  you have the ISIS magazine  printed in English and published to recruit. Armed groups also invest in complex fund raising    not looting  but setting up profitable businesses  for example  construction companies. Now  these activities are keys. They allow these groups to increase their strength  increase their funds  to better recruit and to build their brand. Armed groups also do something else  they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services. They build schools  they run hospitals  they set up vocational training programs or micro loan programs. Hezbollah offers all of these services and more. Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing  safety and security. The initial rise of the Taliban in war torn Afghanistan  or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS  can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts to provide security. Now  unfortunately  in these cases  the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population. But in general  providing social services fills a gap  a governance gap left by the government  and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power. For example  the      electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work. Now  this is a really complex picture  yet in the West  when we look at armed groups  we only think of the violent side. But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength  strategy or long term vision. These groups are hybrid. They rise because they fill a gap left by the government  and they emerge to be both armed and political  engage in violent struggle and provide governance. And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated  the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state. Now  what do you call a group like Hezbollah  They run part of a territory  they administer all their functions  they pick up the garbage  they run the sewage system. Is this a state  Is it a rebel group  Or maybe something else  something different and new  And what about ISIS  The lines are blurred. We live in a world of states  non states  and in between  and the more states are weak  like in the Middle East today  the more non state actors step in and fill that gap. This matters for governments  because to counter these groups  they will have to invest more in non military tools. Filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach. This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding. If we better understand armed groups  we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence. So in this new contest between states and non states  military power can win some battles  but it will not give us peace nor stability. To achieve these objectives  what we need is a long term investment in filling that security gap  in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place. Thank you. Imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name  a place with splendid vistas  a place where you can drive just    minutes and put your sailboat on the water. It's a seductive place  isn't it  I don't live there. But I did journey on a        mile trip for two years  to the fastest growing and whitest counties in America. What is a Whitopia  I define Whitopia in three ways  First  a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since     . Secondly  the majority of that growth comes from white migrants. And third  the Whitopia has an ineffable charm  a pleasant look and feel  a je Ne sais quoi. To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking  I immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them  first  St. George  Utah  second  Coeur d'Alene  Idaho  and third  Forsyth County  Georgia. First stop  St. George    a beautiful town of red rock landscapes. In the     s  Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George to grow cotton because of the hot  arid climate. And so they called it Utah's Dixie  and the name sticks to this day. I approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist. I made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities  who I needed to meet  where I needed to be  and I threw myself with gusto in these communities. I went to zoning board meetings  I went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs. I went to poker nights. In St. George  I rented a home at the Entrada  one of the town's premier gated communities. There were no Motel  's or Howard Johnsons for me. I lived in Whitopia as a resident  and not like a visitor. I rented myself this home by phone. Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia. When I went on my journey  I had barely ever held a golf club. By the time I left  I was golfing at least three times a week. Golf helps people bond. Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses. One venture capitalist  for example  invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members. I also went fishing. Because I had never fished  this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use. I also played poker every weekend. It was Texas Hold 'em with a     buy in. My poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew  but they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs. Some of the most raw  salty conversations I ever had during my journey were at the poker table. I'm a gung ho entertainer. I love to cook  I hosted many dinner parties  and in return  people invited me to their dinner parties  and to their barbecues  and to their pool parties  and to their birthday parties. But it wasn't all fun. Immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia. The St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration  and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become. It was a real time preview  and so it has become. Next stop  Almost Heaven  a cabin I rented for myself in Coeur d'Alene  in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle. I rented this place for myself  also by phone. The book  A Thousand Places To See Before You Die  lists Coeur d'Alene    it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen  boatmen and fishermen. My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene. I golfed with retired LAPD cops. In       around        families and cops fled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest  for North Idaho  and they've built an expatriated community. Given the conservatism of these cops  there's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture. In fact  it is said  North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations. So what's a resident to do to fit in  I hit the gun club. When I rented a gun  the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind  until I showed him my New York City driver's license. That's when he got nervous. I'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been. What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around. In North Idaho  in my red pickup truck  I kept a notepad. And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people. In North Idaho  I found Confederate flags on key chains  on cellphone paraphernalia  and on cars. About a seven minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Aryan Nations  the white supremacist group. America's Promise Ministries  the religious arm of Aryan Nations  happened to have a three day retreat during my visit. So I decided to crash it. I'm the only non Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so. Among the many memorable episodes of that retreat... ...is when Abe  an Aryan  sidled up next to me. He slapped my knee  and he said   Hey Rich  I just want you to know one thing. We are not white supremacists. We are white separatists. We don't think we're better than you  we just want to be away from you.  Indeed  most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists or white separatists  in fact  they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all. Rather  they emigrate there for friendliness  comfort  security  safety    reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself. Next stop was Georgia. In Georgia  I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta. In Utah  I found poker  in Idaho  I found guns  in Georgia  I found God. The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer Church  a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus. I was active in the youth ministry. And for me  personally  I was more comfortable in this Whitopia than say  in a Colorado  or an Idaho  or even a suburban Boston. That is because  there   in Georgia  white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another. I was less exotic in this Whitopia. But what does it all mean  Whitopian dreaming  Whitopia migration  is a push pull phenomenon  full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls  and Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias. It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons  though it has racist outcomes. Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals  social welfare abuse  minorities  density  crowded schools. Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit  freedom  the allure of privatism    privatized places  privatized people  privatized things. And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism without racists. Many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn't believe I would go on such a venture. The reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind. Interpersonal race relations    how we treat each other as human beings    are vastly better than in my parents' generation. Can you imagine me going to Whitopia    years ago  What a journey that would have been. And yet  some things haven't changed. America is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in     . As Americans  we often find ways to cook for each other  to dance with each other  to host with each other  but why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities  It's a devastating irony  how we have gone forward as individuals  and backwards as communities. One of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying   One black man is a delightful dinner guest     black men is a ghetto.  One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year     . By       white people will no longer be the American majority. As such  will there be more Whitopias  In looking at this  the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have  the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias. I ventured on my two year         mile journey to learn where  why  and how white people are fleeing  but I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey. I didn't expect to learn so much about myself. I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia    or a Blacktopia  for that matter. I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get. And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. Thank you. There's this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love. He says   Don't hate the media. Be the media.  I'm an artist. I like working with media and technology because A  I'm familiar with them and I like the power they hold. And B  I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold. I remember watching  in       an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then US Defense Secretary  Donald Rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq  and Rumsfeld is asked the question   Well  we're hear about our body counts  but we never hear about theirs  why   And Rumsfeld's answer is   Well  we don't do body counts on other people.  Right  It's estimated that between         to one million Iraqis  civilians  have died as a result of the US led invasion in     . That number is in stark contrast with the       US service members who died during that same window of time. I wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number. I wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians who died as a result of the invasion. Monuments to war  such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial  are often enormous in scale. Very powerful and very one sided. I wanted my monument to live in the world  and to circulate. I remember when I was a boy in school  my teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government. And we were told  if we wrote a really good letter  if we really thought about it  we would get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply. This is my  Notepad.  What looks like an everyday  yellow legal tablet of paper is actually a monument to the individual Iraqi civilians that died as a result of the US invasion.  Notepad  is an act of protest and an act of commemoration disguised as an everyday tablet of paper. The lines of the paper  when magnified  are revealed to be micro printed text that contains the details  the names  the dates and locations of individual Iraqi civilians that died. So  for the last   years  I've been taking pads of this paper  tons of this stuff  and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the United States and the Coalition governments. I don't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did that. But also  I've been meeting one on one with members and former members of the so called Coalition of the Willing  who assisted in the invasion. And so  whenever I can  I meet with one of them  and I share the project with them. And last summer  I had the chance to meet with former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author  Alberto Gonzales. This is a special legal tablet. It's actually part of an ongoing art project. Alberto Gonzalez  This is a special legal pad  MK  Yes. You won't believe me  but it's in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art  I'm an artist. MK  And all of the lines of the paper are actually    AG  Are they going to disappear  MK  No  they're micro printed text that contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians who have died since the invasion of Iraq. AG  Yeah. OK. AG  Thank you. MK  Thank you. The way he says  thank you  really creeps me out. OK  so I'd like each of you to look under your chairs. There's an envelope. And please open it. The paper you're holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion. I'd like you to use this paper and write a member of government. You can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives. Because every letter that's sent in to the government  and this is all across the world  of course    every letter that is sent in is archived  filed and recorded. Together  we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power. Everything that's sent in eventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government  our shared historical record. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So  tell me Matt  how did this idea come into your head  of  Notepad   Matt Kenyon  I'd just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and it was a black armband that was called the  Improvised Empathetic Device  which accumulated  in real time  the names  ranks  cause of death and location of US service members who had died overseas  and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data  it would stab me in the arm. And so  I became aware that there was a spectacle associated with our own people who were dying overseas  but a disproportionate amount of casualties were the civilian casualties. TR  Thank you so much. MK  Thank you. What do you do when you have a headache  You swallow an aspirin. But for this pill to get to your head  where the pain is  it goes through your stomach  intestines and various other organs first. Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering any medication in the body. The downside  though  is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution. And this is a big problem  particularly in HIV patients. When they take their anti HIV drugs  these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood  and increasing the CD  cell counts. But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects  but mostly bad  because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood  and worse  by the time they get to the sites where it matters most  within the HIV viral reservoirs. These areas in the body    such as the lymph nodes  the nervous system  as well as the lungs    where the virus is sleeping  and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti HIV drugs therapy. However  upon discontinuation of therapy  the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood. Now  all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment  which is a life long treatment that must be swallowed by patients. One day  I sat and thought   Can we deliver anti HIV directly within its reservoir sites  without the risk of drug dilution   As a laser scientist  the answer was just before my eyes  Lasers  of course. If they can be used for dentistry  for diabetic wound healing and surgery  they can be used for anything imaginable  including transporting drugs into cells. As a matter of fact  we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes  which open and close almost immediately in HIV infected cells  in order to deliver drugs within them.  How is that possible   you may ask. Well  we shine a very powerful but super tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug. The laser pierces the cell  while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds. Before you even know it  the induced hole becomes immediately repaired. Now  we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petri dishes  but the goal is to get this technology in the human body  apply it in the human body.  How is that possible   you may ask. Well  the answer is  through a three headed device. Using the first head  which is our laser  we will make an incision in the site of infection. Using the second head  which is a camera  we meander to the site of infection. Finally  using a third head  which is a drug spreading sprinkler  we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection  while the laser is again used to poke those cells open. Well  this might not seem like much right now. But one day  if successful  this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body. Yes. A cure for HIV. This is every HIV researcher's dream    in our case  a cure lead by lasers. Thank you. Today  I want to talk to you about dreams. I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life  and it's cooler than in the movies. Beyond flying  breathing fire  and making hot men spontaneously appear ... I can do things like read and write music. Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream. And I did accepted. So  yeah. I am a very visual thinker. I think in pictures  not words. To me  words are more like instincts and language. There are many people like me  Nikola Tesla  for example  who could visualize  design  test  and troubleshoot everything    all of his inventions    in his mind  accurately. Language is kind of exclusive to our species  anyway. I am a bit more primitive  like a beta version of Google Translate. My brain has the ability to hyper focus on things that interest me. For example  once I had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages. There are some other unusual things about me. You may have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice. That's why people often confuse me with a GPS. This can make basic communication a challenge  unless you need directions. Thank you. A few years ago  when I started doing presentations  I went to get head shots done for the first time. The photographer told me to look flirty. And I had no idea what she was talking about. She said   Do that thing  you know  with your eyes  when you're flirting with guys.   What thing   I asked.  You know  squint.  And so I tried  really. It looked something like this. I looked like I was searching for Waldo. There's a reason for this  as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding. I have Asperger's  a high functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display. It's made life difficult in many ways  and growing up  I struggled to fit in socially. My friends would tell jokes  but I didn't understand them. My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert    and they taught me humor. My personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm. Needless to say  I did not have many friends. I was also hypersensitive to texture. The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles  and so for years  I refused to shower. I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now  though. I had to do a lot to get here  and my parents    things kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer  and on top of everything  it made a difficult situation worse. And I had to travel       miles across the country to get treatment  but within days of them prescribing a new medication  my life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead. I became paranoid  and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me. My family finally rescued me  but by that time  I had lost    pounds in those three weeks  as well as developing severe anemia  and was on the verge of suicide. I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions  my trauma  and my social anxiety  and they knew how to treat it  and I got the help I finally needed. And after    months of hard work  I went on to do incredible things. One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes  these people have a very complex inner life  and I know for myself  I have a very colorful personality  rich ideas  and just a lot going on in my mind. But there's a gap between where that stands  and how I communicate it with the rest of the world. And this can make basic communication a challenge. Not many places would hire me  due to my lack of social skills  which is why I applied to Waffle House. Waffle House is an exceptional    hour diner    thank you    where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse ... Sliced  diced  peppered  chunked  topped  capped  and covered. As social norms would have it  you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night. So one time  at   am  I was chatting with a waitress  and I asked her   What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job   And she told me that one time  a man walked in completely naked. I said   Great  Sign me up for the graveyard shift   Needless to say  Waffle House did not hire me. So in terms of having Asperger's  it can be viewed as a disadvantage  and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt  but it's also the opposite. It's a gift  and it allows me to think innovatively. At     I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs  and I ended up speaking at the UN Convention of Biological Diversity  presenting this research. Thank you. And at     I'm getting ready to graduate college  and I am a co founder of a biotech company called AutismSees. Thank you. But consider what I had to do to get here     therapists     misdiagnoses  and years of pain and trauma. I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way  and I think there is  autism assistive technology. This technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder  or ASD. The app Podium  released by my company  AutismSees  has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills. In addition to this  it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates a public speaking and job interview experience. And so maybe one day  Waffle House will hire me  after practicing on it some more. And one of the great things is that I've used Podium to help me prepare for today  and it's been a great help. But it's more than that. There's more that can be done. For people with ASD    it has been speculated that many innovative scientists  researchers  artists  and engineers have it  like  for example  Emily Dickinson  Jane Austen  Isaac Newton  and Bill Gates are some examples. But the problem that's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared if there are communication roadblocks. And so  many people with autism are being overlooked every day  and they're being taken advantage of. So my dream for people with autism is to change that  to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding. One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free  without judgment of social and physical consequences. When I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind  I am at peace. I am free from judgment  and so I can do whatever I want  you know  I'm making out with Brad Pitt  and Angelina is totally cool with it. But the goal of autism assistive technology is bigger than that  and more important. My goal is to shift people's perspective of autism and people with higher functioning Asperger's because there is a lot they can do. I mean  look at Temple Grandin  for example. And by doing so  we allow people to share their talents with this world and move this world forward. In addition  we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world  in real time. Thank you. Thank you. Over the past    years  I've been researching the way people organize and visualize information. And I've noticed an interesting shift. For a long period of time  we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us  also known as the great chain of being  or  Scala naturae  in Latin  a top down structure that normally starts with God at the very top  followed by angels  noblemen  common people  animals  and so on. This idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology  which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories  like the ones you see behind me. But over time  interestingly enough  this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the Porphyrian tree  also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge. The branching scheme of the tree was  in fact  such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became  over time  an important communication tool to map a variety of systems of knowledge. We can see trees being used to map morality  with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices  as you can see here  with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe. We can see trees being used to map consanguinity  the various blood ties between people. We can also see trees being used to map genealogy  perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram. I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees. Many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way. We can see trees even mapping systems of law  the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers. And finally  of course  also a very popular scientific metaphor  we can see trees being used to map all species known to man. And trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways  they really embody this human desire for order  for balance  for unity  for symmetry. However  nowadays we are really facing new complex  intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram. And a new metaphor is currently emerging  and it's currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge. It's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us. And this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network. And we can see this shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge. We can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain. While before  we used to think of the brain as a modular  centralized organ  where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors  the more we know about the brain  the more we think of it as a large music symphony  played by hundreds and thousands of instruments. This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project  where you can see        neurons and    million connections. And this is only mapping    percent of a mammalian neocortex. We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge. These are some remarkable trees of knowledge  or trees of science  by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull. And Llull was actually the precursor  the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree  a metaphor we use every single day  when we say   Biology is a branch of science   when we say   Genetics is a branch of science.  But perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge  at least for me  was created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in     . This was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment  and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia. And it actually maps out all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree. But knowledge is much more intricate than this. These are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter linkage of articles    related to history on the left  and mathematics on the right. And I think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia    arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man    we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent  just like a network. We can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people. This is the typical organization chart. I'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well  in your own corporations  or others. It's a top down structure that normally starts with the CEO at the very top  and where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom. But humans sometimes are  well  actually  all humans are unique in their own way  and sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure. I think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot. This is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between Perl developers. Perl is a famous programming language  and here  you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files  and working together on a given project. And here  you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process    there's no leader in this organization  it's a network. We can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism. One of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays is that we are dealing with decentralized  independent cells  where there's no leader leading the whole process. And here  you can actually see how visualization is being used. The diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in     . And what they did here is  they actually segmented the network into three different years  represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me. And the blue lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year. So even though there's no leader per se  these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization  the ones that know more about the past  and the future plans and goals of this particular cell. We can also see this shift from trees into networks in the way we classify and organize species. The image on the right is the only illustration that Darwin included in  The Origin of Species   which Darwin called the  Tree of Life.  There's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher  expanding on the importance of this particular diagram. It was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution. But recently  scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria  and these bacteria are actually tying together species that were completely separated before  to what scientists are now calling not the tree of life  but the web of life  the network of life. And finally  we can really see this shift  again  when we look at ecosystems around our planet. No more do we have these simplified predator versus prey diagrams we have all learned at school. This is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem. This is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne  mapping close to     species that interact with the codfish off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada. And I think here  we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature of most ecosystems that abound on our planet. But even though recent  this metaphor of the network  is really already adopting various shapes and forms  and it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy. It's almost becoming the syntax of a new language. And this is one aspect that truly fascinates me. And these are actually    different typologies I've been collecting over time  and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor. And here is an example. On the very top band  you have radial convergence  a visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years. At the top left  the very first project is a gene network  followed by a network of IP addresses    machines  servers    followed by a network of Facebook friends. You probably couldn't find more disparate topics  yet they are using the same metaphor  the same visual model  to map the never ending complexities of its own subject. And here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting  of this growing visual taxonomy of networks. But networks are not just a scientific metaphor. As designers  researchers  and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems  they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields  like painting and sculpture  and influencing many different artists. And perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them    they're immensely gorgeous    they are really becoming a cultural meme  and driving a new art movement  which I've called  networkism.  And we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways. This is just one of many examples  where you can see this influence from science into art. The example on your left side is IP mapping  a computer generated map of IP addresses  again    servers  machines. And on your right side  you have  Transient Structures and Unstable Networks  by Sharon Molloy  using oil and enamel on canvas. And here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy  some gorgeous  intricate paintings. And here's another example of that interesting cross pollination between science and art. On your left side  you have  Operation Smile.  It is a computer generated map of a social network. And on your right side  you have  Field     by Emma McNally  using only graphite on paper. Emma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement  and she creates these striking  imaginary landscapes  where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization. But networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions. This is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement. And I think the title really says it all    it's called   Galaxies Forming Along Filaments  Like Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider's Web.  And I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful. It was created by Tom s Saraceno  and he occupies these large spaces  creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes. As you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes  the entire network kind of shifts  almost like a real organic network would. And here's yet another example of networkism taken to a whole different level. This was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota in a piece called  In Silence.  And Chiharu  like Tom s Saraceno  fills these rooms with this dense network  this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread  sometimes including objects  as you can see here  sometimes even including people  in many of her installations. But networks are also not just a new trend  and it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such. Networks really embody notions of decentralization  of interconnectedness  of interdependence. And this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays  from decoding the human brain  to understanding the vast universe out there. On your left side  you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse    very similar to our own at this particular scale. And on your right side  you have the Millennium Simulation. It was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure. It was able to recreate the history of    million galaxies in approximately    terabytes of output. And coincidentally or not  I just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge    the brain    and the largest scale of knowledge    the universe itself    to be really quite striking and fascinating. Because as Bruce Mau once said   When everything is connected to everything else  for better or for worse  everything matters.  Thank you so much. This is a painting from the   th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder. It shows the famous Fountain of Youth. If you drink its water or you bathe in it  you will get health and youth. Every culture  every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth. There are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De Le n  the explorer  who spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth. They didn't find it. But what if there was something to it  What if there was something to this Fountain of Youth  I will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age related diseases in the future. It started with experiments that showed  in a recent number of studies about growing  that animals    old mice    that share a blood supply with young mice can get rejuvenated. This is similar to what you might see in humans  in Siamese twins  and I know this sounds a bit creepy. But what Tom Rando  a stem cell researcher  reported in       was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated if it's exposed to young blood through common circulation. This was reproduced by Amy Wagers at Harvard a few years later  and others then showed that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed in the pancreas  the liver and the heart. But what I'm most excited about  and several other labs as well  is that this may even apply to the brain. So  what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called parabiosis  shows a younger brain    and a brain that functions better. And I repeat  an old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation looks younger and functions younger in its brain. So when we get older    we can look at different aspects of human cognition  and you can see on this slide here  we can look at reasoning  verbal ability and so forth. And up to around age    or     these functions are all intact  and as I look at the young audience here in the room  we're all still fine. But it's scary to see how all these curves go south. And as we get older  diseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop. We know that with age  the connections between neurons    the way neurons talk to each other  the synapses    they start to deteriorate  neurons die  the brain starts to shrink  and there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases. One big problem we have    to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level    is that we can't study the brains in detail  in living people. We can do cognitive tests  we can do imaging    all kinds of sophisticated testing. But we usually have to wait until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease. This is what neuropathologists do  for example. So  how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism. Could we potentially understand more about what happens in the brain at the molecular level if we see the brain as part of the entire body  So if the body ages or gets sick  does that affect the brain  And vice versa  as the brain gets older  does that influence the rest of the body  And what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood. Blood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen  for example  the red blood cells  or fights infectious diseases  but it also carries messenger molecules  hormone like factors that transport information from one cell to another  from one tissue to another  including the brain. So if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age  can we learn something about the brain  We know that as we get older  the blood changes as well  so these hormone like factors change as we get older. And by and large  factors that we know are required for the development of tissues  for the maintenance of tissues    they start to decrease as we get older  while factors involved in repair  in injury and in inflammation    they increase as we get older. So there's this unbalance of good and bad factors  if you will. And to illustrate what we can do potentially with that  I want to talk you through an experiment that we did. We had almost     blood samples from healthy human beings    to    years of age  and we measured over     of these communication factors  these hormone like proteins that transport information between tissues. And what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group  about half the factors changed significantly. So our body lives in a very different environment as we get older  when it comes to these factors. And using statistical or bioinformatics programs  we could try to discover those factors that best predict age    in a way  back calculate the relative age of a person. And the way this looks is shown in this graph. So  on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived  the chronological age. So  how many years they lived. And then we take these top factors that I showed you  and we calculate their relative age  their biological age. And what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation  so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person. But what's really exciting are the outliers  as they so often are in life. You can see here  the person I highlighted with the green dot is about    years of age but seems to have a biological age  if what we're doing here is really true  of only about   . So is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age  But more importantly  Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age related disease and will have a long life    will live to     or more  On the other hand  the person here  highlighted with the red dot  is not even     but has a biological age of   . Is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age related disease  So in our lab  we're trying to understand these factors better  and many other groups are trying to understand  what are the true aging factors  and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age related diseases  So what I've shown you so far is simply correlational  right  You can just say   Well  these factors change with age   but you don't really know if they do something about aging. So what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue. And that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis. So  parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together  and that leads then to a shared blood system  where we can now ask   How does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood   And for this purpose  we use young mice that are an equivalency of    year old people  and old mice that are roughly    years old in human years. What we found is quite remarkable. We find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains. There's an increased activity of the synapses  the connections between neurons. There are more genes expressed that are known to be involved in the formation of new memories. And there's less of this bad inflammation. But we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals. So when we connect them  there are actually no cells going into the old brain  in this model. Instead  we've reasoned  then  that it must be the soluble factors  so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma  and inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice  and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects  but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice. As mice get older  like us humans  they have memory problems. It's just harder to detect them  but I'll show you in a minute how we do that. But we wanted to take this one step further  one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans. What I'm showing you now are unpublished studies  where we used human plasma  young human plasma  and as a control  saline  and injected it into old mice  and asked  can we again rejuvenate these old mice  Can we make them smarter  And to do this  we used a test. It's called a Barnes maze. This is a big table that has lots of holes in it  and there are guide marks around it  and there's a bright light  as on this stage here. The mice hate this and they try to escape  and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow  where a tube is mounted underneath where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole. So we teach them  over several days  to find this space on these cues in the space  and you can compare this for humans  to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping. Many of us have probably had some problems with that. So  let's look at an old mouse here. This is an old mouse that has memory problems  as you'll notice in a moment. It just looks into every hole  but it didn't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day. In stark contrast  this mouse here is a sibling of the same age  but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks  with small injections every three days. And as you noticed  it almost looks around   Where am I      and then walks straight to that hole and escapes. So  it could remember where that hole was. So by all means  this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated    it functions more like a younger mouse. And it also suggests that there is something not only in young mouse plasma  but in young human plasma that has the capacity to help this old brain. So to summarize  we find the old mouse  and its brain in particular  are malleable. They're not set in stone  we can actually change them. It can be rejuvenated. Young blood factors can reverse aging  and what I didn't show you    in this model  the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old. So there are old blood factors that can accelerate aging. And most importantly  humans may have similar factors  because we can take young human blood and have a similar effect. Old human blood  I didn't show you  does not have this effect  it does not make the mice younger. So  is this magic transferable to humans  We're running a small clinical study at Stanford  where we treat Alzheimer's patients with mild disease with a pint of plasma from young volunteers     year olds  and do this once a week for four weeks  and then we look at their brains with imaging. We test them cognitively  and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living. What we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment. And if that's the case  that could give us hope that what I showed you works in mice might also work in humans. Now  I don't think we will live forever. But maybe we discovered that the Fountain of Youth is actually within us  and it has just dried out. And if we can turn it back on a little bit  maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects  we can produce these factors synthetically and we can treat diseases of aging  such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. Thank you very much. For more than     years  the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments. For much of this time  this assistance was manual. Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand. Calls were recorded to tape. But as in so many other industries  computing has changed everything. The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks. I want that to sink in for a second  Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first. First and foremost. So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse  your children  a colleague or your doctor on the telephone  someone could be listening. Now  that someone might be your own government  it could also be another government  a foreign intelligence service  or a hacker  or a criminal  or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system  that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies. But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority  Silicon Valley companies have not. And increasingly  over the last couple years  Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult. For example  many of you might have an iPhone  and if you use an iPhone to send a text message to other people who have an iPhone  those text messages cannot easily be wiretapped. And in fact  according to Apple  they're not able to even see the text messages themselves. Likewise  if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones  that  too  cannot be easily wiretapped. And it's not just Apple. WhatsApp  which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world  also has built strong encryption technology into its product  which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments  often authoritarian  wiretapping their text messages. So  after     years of being able to listen to any telephone call    anytime  anywhere    you might imagine that government officials are not very happy. And in fact  that's what's happening. Government officials are extremely mad. And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available. What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default. It's the default piece that matters. In short  the tech companies have democratized encryption. And so  government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron  they believe that all communications    emails  texts  voice calls    all of these should be available to governments  and encryption is making that difficult. Now  look    I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view. We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world  and there really are bad people out there. There are terrorists and other serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor. But those surveillance features come at a cost. The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop  or a drug dealer's cell phone. We all use the same communications devices. What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted  then so can the rest of ours  too. And I think we really need to ask  Should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly  So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described    this is not imaginary. In       the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks    the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police    those systems were compromised by the Chinese government  because the Chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring. By the same token  in       the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece    Greece's largest telephone company    was compromised by an unknown entity  and that feature  the surveillance feature  was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet. The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught. And really  this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features  or backdoors. When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology  you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it. You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side  by good guys  or by bad guys. And so for that reason  I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible. Yes  this means that in the future  encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult. It means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys. But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals  by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies. And I don't want to live in that kind of world. And so right now  you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets  you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are  or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are. And so  my message to you is this  We need to use these tools. We need to secure our telephone calls. We need to secure our text messages. I want you to use these tools. I want you to tell your loved ones  I want you to tell your colleagues  Use these encrypted communications tools. Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy  but use them because they're secure. Thank you. I was raised by lesbians in the mountains  and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back. Really messed with my head  but I'll get into that later. I'll start with when I was eight years old. I took a wood box  and I buried a dollar bill  a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado. And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in     years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas  maybe how we ate our spaghetti. I really didn't know. Anyway  this is kind of funny  because here I am     years later  and I'm still making boxes. Now  at some point I was in Hawaii    I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff  and I was making a collage for my ma. And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up  and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid  and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck. Now  she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them  so I poured more resin on the canvas  thinking I could hide it or something. Instead  the opposite happened  It sort of created a magnification  like a magnifying glass  on the dictionary text. So what did I do  I built more boxes. This time  I started putting electronics  frogs  strange bottles I'd find in the street    anything I could find    because I was always finding things my whole life  and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects. So I started drawing around the objects  and I realized  Holy moly  I can draw in space  I can make free floating lines  like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene. So I took the objects out  and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens. First  botanical    which you can kind of get a sense of. Then I made some weird insects and creatures. It was really fun  I was just drawing on the layers of resin. And it was cool  because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff  I was making some money  I could take my girlfriend for dinner  and like  go to Sizzler. It was some good shit  man. At some point  I got up to the human form  life size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers. This was great  except for one thing  I was going to die. I didn't know what to do  because the resin was going to kill me. And I went to bed every night thinking about it. So I tried using glass. I started drawing on the layers of glass  almost like if you drew on a window  then you put another window  and another window  and you had all these windows together that made a three dimensional composition. And this really worked  because I could stop using the resin. So I did this for years  which culminated in a very large work  which I call  The Triptych.   The Triptych  was largely inspired by Hieronymus Bosch's   The  Garden of Earthly Delights   which is a painting in the  Museo del  Prado in Spain. Do you guys know this painting  Good  it's a cool painting. It's kind of ahead of its time  they say. So   The Triptych.  I'll walk you through this piece. It weighs        pounds. It's    feet long. It's double sided  so it's    feet of composition. It's kind of weird. Well  that's the blood fountain. To the left  you have Jesus and the locusts. There's a cave where all these animal headed creatures travel between two worlds. They go from the representational world  to this analog mesh underworld  where they're hiding. This is where the animal headed creatures are by the lighthouse  and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean. The ocean is made up of thousands of elements. This is a bird god tied up to a battleship. Billy Graham is in the ocean  the Horizon from the oil spill  Waldo  Osama Bin Laden's shelter    there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard  in the ocean. Anyway  this is a lady creature. She's coming out of the ocean  and she's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand. Her hands are like scales  and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance. So that's one side of  The Triptych.  It's a little narrative thing. That's her hand that she's spitting into. And then  when you go to the other side  she has like a trunk  like a bird's beak  and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk. Then she has an    foot long serpent's tail that connects  The Triptych.  Anyway  her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano. I don't know why that happened. That happens  you know. Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball  made out of      terrorist cards. Have you guys seen those  They were made in the     's  they're like baseball cards of terrorists. Way ahead of their time. That will bring you to my latest project. I'm in the middle of two projects  One's called  Psychogeographies.  It's about a six year project to make     of these humans. Each one is an archive of our culture  through our ripped up media and matter  whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines. But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human  and they travel in groups of        or    at a time. They're like cells    they come together  they divide. And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years. Each one is basically a       pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside. This one has a little cave in his chest. That's his head  there's the chest  you can kind of see the beginning. I'm going to go down the body for you  There's a waterfall coming out of his chest  covering his penis    or not penis  or whatever it is  a kind of androgynous thing. I'll take you quickly through these works  because I can't explain them for too long. There are the layers  you can kind of see it. That's a body getting split in half. This one has two heads  and it's communicating between the two heads. You can see the pills coming out  going into one head from this weird statue. There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity. Can you see that  Anyway  this talk's all about these boxes  like the boxes we're in. This box we're in  the solar system is a box. This brings you to my latest box. It's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works. Inside of this box is a physicist  a neuroscientist  a painter  a musician  a writer  a radio station  a museum  a school  a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world  a garden. We shake this box up  and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles. And I think that's the way you change the world. You redefine your insides and the box that you're living in. And you come together to realize that we're all in this together  that this delusion of difference    this idea of countries  of borders  of religion    doesn't work. We're all really made up of the same stuff  in the same box. And if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely  we're all going to die real soon. Thank you very much. I'd like to introduce you to an emerging area of science  one that is still speculative but hugely exciting  and certainly one that's growing very rapidly. Quantum biology asks a very simple question  Does quantum mechanics    that weird and wonderful and powerful theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry    also play a role inside the living cell  In other words  Are there processes  mechanisms  phenomena in living organisms that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics  Now  quantum biology isn't new  it's been around since the early     s. But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments    in biochemistry labs  using spectroscopy    have shown very clear  firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them. Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists  biochemists  molecular biologists    it's a very interdisciplinary field. I come from quantum physics  so I'm a nuclear physicist. I've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics. One of the founders of quantum mechanics  Niels Bohr  said  If you're not astonished by it  then you haven't understood it. So I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it. That's a good thing. But it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe    the building blocks of reality. If we think about the scale of size  start with an everyday object like the tennis ball  and just go down orders of magnitude in size    from the eye of a needle down to a cell  down to a bacterium  down to an enzyme    you eventually reach the nano world. Now  nanotechnology may be a term you've heard of. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. My area is the atomic nucleus  which is the tiny dot inside an atom. It's even smaller in scale. This is the domain of quantum mechanics  and physicists and chemists have had a long time to try and get used to it. Biologists  on the other hand  have got off lightly  in my view. They are very happy with their balls and sticks models of molecules. The balls are the atoms  the sticks are the bonds between the atoms. And when they can't build them physically in the lab  nowadays  they have very powerful computers that will simulate a huge molecule. This is a protein made up of         atoms. It doesn't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it. Quantum mechanics was developed in the     s. It is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas that explain the world of the very small. And it's a world that's very different from our everyday world  made up of trillions of atoms. It's a world built on probability and chance. It's a fuzzy world. It's a world of phantoms  where particles can also behave like spread out waves. If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics  then  as the fundamental foundation of reality itself  then it's not surprising that we say quantum physics underpins organic chemistry. After all  it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules. Organic chemistry  scaled up in complexity  gives us molecular biology  which of course leads to life itself. So in a way  it's sort of not surprising. It's almost trivial. You say   Well  of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics.  But so does everything else. So does all inanimate matter  made up of trillions of atoms. Ultimately  there's a quantum level where we have to delve into this weirdness. But in everyday life  we can forget about it. Because once you put together trillions of atoms  that quantum weirdness just dissolves away. Quantum biology isn't about this. Quantum biology isn't this obvious. Of course quantum mechanics underpins life at some molecular level. Quantum biology is about looking for the non trivial    the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics    and to see if they do  indeed  play an important role in describing the processes of life. Here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness of the quantum world. This is the quantum skier. He seems to be intact  he seems to be perfectly healthy  and yet  he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time. Well  if you saw tracks like that you'd guess it was some sort of stunt  of course. But in the quantum world  this happens all the time. Particles can multitask  they can be in two places at once. They can do more than one thing at the same time. Particles can behave like spread out waves. It's almost like magic. Physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness. I don't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics. You see  this weirdness is very delicate  and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs. We cool our system down to near absolute zero  we carry out our experiments in vacuums  we try and isolate it from any external disturbance. That's very different from the warm  messy  noisy environment of a living cell. Biology itself  if you think of molecular biology  seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry    chemical reactions. And these are reductionist  deterministic chemical reactions  showing that  essentially  life is made of the same stuff as everything else  and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world  then we should be able to forget about it in biology  as well. Well  one man begged to differ with this idea. Erwin Schr dinger  of Schr dinger's Cat fame  was an Austrian physicist. He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the     s. In       he wrote a book called  What is Life   It was tremendously influential. It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson  the discoverers of the double helix structure of DNA. To paraphrase a description in the book  he says  At the molecular level  living organisms have a certain order  a structure to them that's very different from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate matter of the same complexity. In fact  living matter seems to behave in this order  in a structure  just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero  where quantum effects play a very important role. There's something special about the structure    the order    inside a living cell. So  Schr dinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life. It's a very speculative  far reaching idea  and it didn't really go very far. But as I mentioned at the start  in the last    years  there have been experiments emerging  showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics. I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones. This is one of the best known phenomena in the quantum world  quantum tunneling. The box on the left shows the wavelike  spread out distribution of a quantum entity    a particle  like an electron  which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall. It's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall  like a phantom leaping through to the other side. You can see a faint smudge of light in the right hand box. Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier  and yet somehow  as though by magic  disappear from one side and reappear on the other. The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall  you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall. In the quantum world  you don't have to throw it over the wall  you can throw it at the wall  and there's a certain non zero probability that it'll disappear on your side  and reappear on the other. This isn't speculation  by the way. We're happy    well   happy  is not the right word    we are familiar with this. Quantum tunneling takes place all the time  in fact  it's the reason our Sun shines. The particles fuse together  and the Sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling. Back in the   s and   s  it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells. Enzymes  those workhorses of life  the catalysts of chemical reactions    enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells  by many  many orders of magnitude. And it's always been a mystery how they do this. Well  it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of  is by transferring subatomic particles  like electrons and indeed protons  from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling. It's efficient  it's fast  it can disappear    a proton can disappear from one place  and reappear on the other. Enzymes help this take place. This is research that's been carried out back in the   s  particularly by a group in Berkeley  Judith Klinman. Other groups in the UK have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this. Research carried out by my group    so as I mentioned  I'm a nuclear physicist  but I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in atomic nuclei  and so can apply those tools in other areas as well. One question we asked is whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in DNA. Again  this is not a new idea  it goes all the way back to the early   s. The two strands of DNA  the double helix structure  are held together by rungs  it's like a twisted ladder. And those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds    protons  that act as the glue between the two strands. So if you zoom in  what they're doing is holding these large molecules    nucleotides    together. Zoom in a bit more. So  this a computer simulation. The two white balls in the middle are protons  and you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond. One prefers to sit on one side  the other  on the other side of the two strands of the vertical lines going down  which you can't see. It can happen that these two protons can hop over. Watch the two white balls. They can jump over to the other side. If the two strands of DNA then separate  leading to the process of replication  and the two protons are in the wrong positions  this can lead to a mutation. This has been known for half a century. The question is  How likely are they to do that  and if they do  how do they do it  Do they jump across  like the ball going over the wall  Or can they quantum tunnel across  even if they don't have enough energy  Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here. We still don't know yet how important it is  this is still an open question. It's speculative  but it's one of those questions that is so important that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations  surely this must have big implications  to understand certain types of mutations  possibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous. Another example of quantum mechanics in biology is quantum coherence  in one of the most important processes in biology  photosynthesis  plants and bacteria taking sunlight  and using that energy to create biomass. Quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking. It's the quantum skier. It's an object that behaves like a wave  so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other  but can follow multiple pathways at the same time. Some years ago  the world of science was shocked when a paper was published showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria  carrying out photosynthesis. The idea is that the photon  the particle of light  the sunlight  the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule  is then delivered to what's called the reaction center  where it can be turned into chemical energy. And in getting there  it doesn't just follow one route  it follows multiple pathways at once  to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat. Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell. A remarkable idea  and yet evidence is growing almost weekly  with new papers coming out  confirming that this does indeed take place. My third and final example is the most beautiful  wonderful idea. It's also still very speculative  but I have to share it with you. The European robin migrates from Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean  every autumn  and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects  they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field. Now  the Earth's magnetic field is very  very weak  it's     times weaker than a fridge magnet  and yet it affects the chemistry    somehow    within a living organism. That's not in doubt    a German couple of ornithologists  Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko  in the     s  confirmed that indeed  the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field  to give it directional information    a built in compass. The puzzle  the mystery was  How does it do it  Well  the only theory in town    we don't know if it's the correct theory  but the only theory in town    is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement. Inside the robin's retina    I kid you not    inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome  which is light sensitive. Within cryptochrome  a pair of electrons are quantum entangled. Now  quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart  and yet somehow remain in contact with each other. Even Einstein hated this idea  he called it  spooky action at a distance.  So if Einstein doesn't like it  then we can all be uncomfortable with it. Two quantum entangled electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth's magnetic field. We don't know if it's the correct explanation  but wow  wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate  Quantum biology is still in it infancy. It's still speculative. But I believe it's built on solid science. I also think that in the coming decade or so  we're going to start to see that actually  it pervades life    that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world. Watch this space. Thank you. The child's symptoms begin with mild fever  headache  muscle pains  followed by vomiting and diarrhea  then bleeding from the mouth  nose and gums. Death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure. Sounds familiar  If you're thinking this is Ebola  actually  in this case  it's not. It's an extreme form of dengue fever  a mosquito born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine  and kills        people each year. That is actually twice the number of people that have been killed by Ebola in the nearly four decades that we've known about it. As for measles  so much in the news recently  the death toll is actually tenfold higher. Yet for the last year  it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear. Clearly  there is something deeply rooted about it  something which scares us and fascinates us more than other diseases. But what is it  exactly  Well  it's hard to acquire Ebola  but if you do  the risk of a horrible death is high. Why  Because right now  we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available. And so  that's the clue. We may have it someday. So we rightfully fear Ebola  because it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases. In fact  it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles. We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it. We fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola. Ebola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science. But wait a second  why is that  We've known about Ebola since     . We've known what it's capable of. We've had ample opportunity to study it in the    outbreaks that have occurred. And in fact  we've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade. Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now  This goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases. It goes something like this  The people most at risk for these diseases are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines. This leaves little in the way of market incentives for manufacturers to develop vaccines  unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries. It's simply too commercially risky. As for Ebola  there is absolutely no market at all  so the only reason we have two vaccines in late stage clinical trials now  is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear. Ebola was relatively ignored until September    and the anthrax attacks  when all of a sudden  people perceived Ebola as  potentially  a bioterrorism weapon. Why is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point  Well  partially  because it was really difficult    or thought to be difficult    to weaponize the virus  but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it. And this is really the point. The sad reality is  we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people  but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines. Vaccine development is expensive and complicated. It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine. Fortunately for diseases like Ebola  there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers. The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure. In that case  if we want vaccines  we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy. We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us. By creating capabilities within countries  we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens. The data from that then can be used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity  which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed immunologically  and what type of reactions they promote. So these are the things that can be done  but to do this  if we want to deal with a complete market failure  we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases. We have to stop waiting until we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one. So  for Ebola  the paranoid fear of an infectious disease  followed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries  led the global community to come together  and with the work of dedicated vaccine companies  we now have these  Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries    and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind. Every year  we spend billions of dollars  keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen. And yet  we spend virtually nothing to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain as epidemic infectious diseases. And make no mistake about it    it's not a question of  if   but  when.  These bugs are going to continue to evolve and they're going to threaten the world. And vaccines are our best defense. So if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola  we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation. And we need to view this  then  as the ultimate deterrent    something we make sure is available  but at the same time  praying we never have to use it. Thank you. Over a million people are killed each year in disasters. Two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced  and the communities will take    to    years to recover and billions of economic losses. If you can reduce the initial response by one day  you can reduce the overall recovery by a thousand days  or three years. See how that works  If the initial responders can get in  save lives  mitigate whatever flooding danger there is  that means the other groups can get in to restore the water  the roads  the electricity  which means then the construction people  the insurance agents  all of them can get in to rebuild the houses  which then means you can restore the economy  and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster. A major insurance company told me that if they can get a homeowner's claim processed one day earlier  it'll make a difference of six months in that person getting their home repaired. And that's why I do disaster robotics    because robots can make a disaster go away faster. Now  you've already seen a couple of these. These are the UAVs. These are two types of UAVs  a rotorcraft  or hummingbird  a fixed wing  a hawk. And they're used extensively since         Hurricane Katrina. Let me show you how this hummingbird  this rotorcraft  works. Fantastic for structural engineers. Being able to see damage from angles you can't get from binoculars on the ground or from a satellite image  or anything flying at a higher angle. But it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this. You've got things like this fixed wing  this hawk. Now  this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys. That's where you're pulling imagery together and getting  D reconstruction. We used both of these at the Oso mudslides up in Washington State  because the big problem was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster    not the search and rescue. The search and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing. The bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out and flood the responders. And not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage  it's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing along that part of Washington State. So they needed to understand what was going on. In seven hours  going from Arlington  driving from the Incident Command Post to the site  flying the UAVs  processing the data  driving back to Arlington command post    seven hours. We gave them in seven hours data that they could take only two to three days to get any other way    and at higher resolution. It's a game changer. And don't just think about the UAVs. I mean  they are sexy    but remember     percent of the world's population lives by water  and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater    the parts that we can't get to  like the bridges and things like that. And that's why we have unmanned marine vehicles  one type of which you've already met  which is SARbot  a square dolphin. It goes underwater and uses sonar. Well  why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very  very important  They get overlooked. Think about the Japanese tsunami        miles of coastland totally devastated  twice the amount of coastland devastated by Hurricane Katrina in the United States. You're talking about your bridges  your pipelines  your ports    wiped out. And if you don't have a port  you don't have a way to get in enough relief supplies to support a population. That was a huge problem at the Haiti earthquake. So we need marine vehicles. Now  let's look at a viewpoint from the SARbot of what they were seeing. We were working on a fishing port. We were able to reopen that fishing port  using her sonar  in four hours. That fishing port was told it was going to be six months before they could get a manual team of divers in  and it was going to take the divers two weeks. They were going to miss the fall fishing season  which was the major economy for that part  which is kind of like their Cape Cod. UMVs  very important. But you know  all the robots I've shown you have been small  and that's because robots don't do things that people do. They go places people can't go. And a great example of that is Bujold. Unmanned ground vehicles are particularly small  so Bujold    Say hello to Bujold. Bujold was used extensively at the World Trade Center to go through Towers      and  . You're climbing into the rubble  rappelling down  going deep in spaces. And just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint  look at this. You're talking about a disaster where you can't fit a person or a dog    and it's on fire. The only hope of getting to a survivor way in the basement  you have to go through things that are on fire. It was so hot  on one of the robots  the tracks began to melt and come off. Robots don't replace people or dogs  or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins. They do things new. They assist the responders  the experts  in new and innovative ways. The biggest problem is not making the robots smaller  though. It's not making them more heat resistant. It's not making more sensors. The biggest problem is the data  the informatics  because these people need to get the right data at the right time. So wouldn't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots without having to waste any time of driving to the site  so whoever's there  use their robots over the Internet. Well  let's think about that. Let's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county. What are the odds that the experts  your chemical engineer  your railroad transportation engineers  have been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have  Probably  like  none. So we're using these kinds of interfaces to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they're using  or even if they're using a robot or not. What the robots give you  what they give the experts  is data. The problem becomes  who gets what data when  One thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody and let them sort it out. Well  the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks  and worse yet  it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information they need to make the decision that's going to make the difference. So we need to think about those kinds of challenges. So it's the data. Going back to the World Trade Center  we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold only when she was deep in the rubble  because that's what the USAR team said they wanted. What we didn't know at the time was that the civil engineers would have loved  needed the data as we recorded the box beams  the serial numbers  the locations  as we went into the rubble. We lost valuable data. So the challenge is getting all the data and getting it to the right people. Now  here's another reason. We've learned that some buildings    things like schools  hospitals  city halls    get inspected four times by different agencies throughout the response phases. Now  we're looking  if we can get the data from the robots to share  not only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases to shorten the response time  but now we can begin to do the response in parallel. Everybody can see the data. We can shorten it that way. So really   disaster robotics  is a misnomer. It's not about the robots. It's about the data. So my challenge to you  the next time you hear about a disaster  look for the robots. They may be underground  they may be underwater  they may be in the sky  but they should be there. Look for the robots  because robots are coming to the rescue. Paul Krugman  the Nobel Prize  winner  in economics  once wrote   Productivity is not everything  but in the long run  it is almost everything.  So this is serious. There are not that many things on earth that are  almost everything.  Productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society. So we have a problem. In the largest European economies  productivity used to grow five percent per annum in the '  s  '  s  early '  s. From '   to '    three percent per annum. From '   to '    two percent per annum. Since       less than one percent per annum. The same profile in Japan. The same profile in the US  despite a momentary rebound    years ago  and despite all the technological innovations around us  the Internet  the information  the new information and communication technologies. When productivity grows three percent per annum  you double the standard of living every generation. Every generation is twice as well off as its parents'. When it grows one percent per annum  it takes three generations to double the standard of living. And in this process  many people will be less well off than their parents. They will have less of everything  smaller roofs  or perhaps no roof at all  less access to education  to vitamins  to antibiotics  to vaccination    to everything. Think of all the problems that we're facing at the moment. All. Chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis. Why this crisis  Because the basic tenets about efficiency    effectiveness in organizations  in management    have become counterproductive for human efforts. Everywhere in public services    in companies  in the way we work  the way we innovate  invest    try to learn to work better. Take the holy trinity of efficiency  clarity  measurement  accountability. They make human efforts derail. There are two ways to look at it  to prove it. One  the one I prefer  is rigorous  elegant  nice    math. But the full math version takes a little while  so there is another one. It is to look at a relay race. This is what we will do today. It's a bit more animated  more visual and also faster    it's a race. Hopefully  it's faster. World championship final    women. Eight teams in the final. The fastest team is the US team. They have the fastest women on earth. They are the favorite team to win. Notably  if you compare them to an average team  say  the French team  based on their best performances in the     meter race  if you add the individual times of the US runners  they arrive at the finish line  .  meters ahead of the French team. And this year  the US team is in great shape. Based on their best performance this year  they arrive  .  meters ahead of the French team  based on the data. We are going to look at the race. At some point you will see  towards the end  that Torri Edwards  the fourth US runner  is ahead. Not surprising    this year she got the gold medal in the     meter race. And by the way  Chryste Gaines  the second runner in the US team  is the fastest woman on earth. So  there are  .  billion women on earth. Where are the two fastest  On the US team. And the two other runners on the US team are not bad  either. So clearly  the US team has won the war for talent. But behind  the average team is trying to catch up. Let's watch the race. Yves Morieux  So what happened  The fastest team did not win  the slower one did. By the way  I hope you appreciate the deep historical research I did to make the French look good. But let's not exaggerate    it's not archeology  either. But why  Because of cooperation. When you hear this sentence   Thanks to cooperation  the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts.  This is not poetry  this is not philosophy. This is math. Those who carry the baton are slower  but their baton is faster. Miracle of cooperation  it multiplies energy  intelligence in human efforts. It is the essence of human efforts  how we work together  how each effort contributes to the efforts of others. With cooperation  we can do more with less. Now  what happens to cooperation when the holy grail    the holy trinity  even    of clarity  measurement  accountability    appears  Clarity. Management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity. Compliance audits  consultants' diagnostics. We need more clarity  we need to clarify the roles  the processes. It is as though the runners on the team were saying   Let's be clear    where does my role really start and end  Am I supposed to run for    meters        ...   It's important  let's be clear. If you say     after    meters  people will drop the baton  whether there is someone to take it or not. Accountability. We are constantly trying to put accountability in someone's hands. Who is accountable for this process  We need somebody accountable for this process. So in the relay race  since passing the baton is so important  then we need somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton. So between each runner  now we will have a new dedicated athlete  clearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner  and passing it to the next runner. And we will have at least two like that. Well  will we  in that case  win the race  That I don't know  but for sure  we would have a clear interface  a clear line of accountability. We will know who to blame. But we'll never win the race. If you think about it  we pay more attention to knowing who to blame in case we fail  than to creating the conditions to succeed. All the human intelligence put in organization design    urban structures  processing systems    what is the real goal  To have somebody guilty in case they fail. We are creating organizations able to fail  but in a compliant way  with somebody clearly accountable when we fail. And we are quite effective at that    failing. Measurement. What gets measured gets done. Look  to pass the baton  you have to do it at the right time  in the right hand  at the right speed. But to do that  you have to put energy in your arm. This energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs. It will come at the expense of your measurable speed. You have to shout early enough to the next runner when you will pass the baton  to signal that you are arriving  so that the next runner can prepare  can anticipate. And you have to shout loud. But the blood  the energy that will be in your throat will not be in your legs. Because you know  there are eight people shouting at the same time. So you have to recognize the voice of your colleague. You cannot say   Is it you   Too late  Now  let's look at the race in slow motion  and concentrate on the third runner. Look at where she allocates her efforts  her energy  her attention. Not all in her legs    that would be great for her own speed    but in also in her throat  arm  eye  brain. That makes a difference in whose legs  In the legs of the next runner. But when the next runner runs super fast  is it because she made a super effort  or because of the way the third runner passed the baton  There is no metric on earth that will give us the answer. And if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance  they will put their energy  their attention  their blood in what can get measured    in their legs. And the baton will fall and slow down. To cooperate is not a super effort  it is how you allocate your effort. It is to take a risk  because you sacrifice the ultimate protection granted by objectively measurable individual performance. It is to make a super difference in the performance of others  with whom we are compared. It takes being stupid to cooperate  then. And people are not stupid  they don't cooperate. You know  clarity  accountability  measurement were OK when the world was simpler. But business has become much more complex. With my teams  we have measured the evolution of complexity in business. It is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers  to build advantage on a global scale  to create value. And the more business gets complex  the more  in the name of clarity  accountability  measurement we multiply structures  processes  systems. You know  this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a counterproductive multiplication of interfaces  middle offices  coordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources  but that also add obstacles. And the more complicated the organization  the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening. So we need summaries  proxies  reports  key performance indicators  metrics. So people put their energy in what can get measured  at the expense of cooperation. And as performance deteriorates  we add even more structure  process  systems. People spend their time in meetings  writing reports they have to do  undo and redo. Based on our analysis  teams in these organizations spend between    and    percent of their time wasting their time  but working harder and harder  longer and longer  on less and less value adding activities. This is what is killing productivity  what makes people suffer at work. Our organizations are wasting human intelligence. They have turned against human efforts. When people don't cooperate  don't blame their mindsets  their mentalities  their personality    look at the work situations. Is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not  if  when they cooperate  they are individually worse off  Why would they cooperate  When we blame personalities instead of the clarity  the accountability  the measurement  we add injustice to ineffectiveness. We need to create organizations in which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate. Remove the interfaces  the middle offices    all these complicated coordination structures. Don't look for clarity  go for fuzziness. Fuzziness overlaps. Remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance. Speed the  what.  Look at cooperation  the  how.  How did you pass the baton  Did you throw it  or did you pass it effectively  Am I putting my energy in what can get measured    my legs  my speed    or in passing the baton  You  as leaders  as managers  are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate  The future of our organizations  our companies  our societies hinges on your answer to these questions. Thank you. When I was    years old  I was interested in science    fascinated by it  excited to learn about it. And I had a high school science teacher who would say to the class   The girls don't have to listen to this.  Encouraging  yes. I chose not to listen    but to that statement alone. So let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile      kilometers      miles northeast of Santiago. It's very remote  it's very dry and it's very beautiful. And there's not much there. There are condors  there are tarantulas  and at night  when the light dims  it reveals one of the darkest skies on Earth. It's kind of a magic place  the mountain. It's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology. And our ancestors  for as long as there's been recorded history  have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence. And we're no exception  our generation. The only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked by the glare of city lights. And so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops to view and to study the cosmos. So telescopes are our window to the cosmos. It's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the   st century. We have an array of existing telescopes already  in the Andes mountains in Chile  and that's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability. There will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes  sensitive to optical radiation  as our eyes are. There will be a survey telescope that will be scanning the sky every few nights. There will be radio telescopes  sensitive to long wavelength radio radiation. And then there will be telescopes in space. There'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope  it's called the James Webb Telescope  and it will be launched in     . There'll be a satellite called TESS that will discover planets outside of our solar system. For the last decade  I've been leading a group    a consortium    international group  to build what will be  when it's finished  the largest optical telescope in existence. It's called the Giant Magellan Telescope  or GMT. This telescope is going to have mirrors that are  .  meters in diameter    each of the mirrors. That's almost    feet. So it dwarfs this stage    maybe out to the fourth row in this audience. Each of the seven mirrors in this telescope will be almost    feet in diameter. Together  the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise    feet in diameter. So  essentially the size of this entire auditorium. The whole telescope will stand about    meters high  and again  being in Rio  some of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ. The scale is comparable in height  in fact  it's smaller than this telescope will be. It's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty. And it's going to be housed in an enclosure that's    stories       meters high. But it's an unusual building to protect this telescope. It will have open windows to the sky  be able to point and look at the sky  and it will actually rotate on a base          tons of rotating building. The Giant Magellan Telescope will have    times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be    million times more sensitive than the human eye. And it may  for the first time ever  be capable of finding life on planets outside of our solar system. It's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe    literally  the dawn of the cosmos. The cosmic dawn. It's a telescope that's going to allow us to peer back  witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling  the first black holes in the universe  the first galaxies. Now  for thousands of years  we have been studying the cosmos  we've been wondering about our place in the universe. The ancient Greeks told us that the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago  Copernicus displaced the Earth  and put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos. And as we've learned over the centuries  since Galileo Galilei  the Italian scientist  first turned  in that time  a two inch  very small telescope  to the sky  every time we have built larger telescopes  we have learned something about the universe  we've made discoveries  without exception. We've learned in the   th century that the universe is expanding and that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion. We know now that the universe is made of about     billion galaxies that are visible to us  and each one of those galaxies has     billion stars within it. So we're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos that's ever been taken. It was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope  and by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky  before the launch of Hubble. And if you can imagine this tiny area  it's only one fiftieth of the size of the full moon. So  if you can imagine the full moon. And there are now        galaxies visible within that image. And the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result of the fact that those galaxies are so far away  the vast distances. And each of those galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars. Telescopes are like time machines. So the farther back we look in space  the further back we see in time. And they're like light buckets    literally  they collect light. So larger the bucket  the larger the mirror we have  the more light we can see  and the farther back we can view. So  we've learned in the last century that there are exotic objects in the universe    black holes. We've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy that we can't see. So you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter. You got it. Not all audiences get that. So the way we infer the presence of dark matter    we can't see it    but there's an unmistakable tug  due to gravity. We now can look out  we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that's expanding. What I do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe  and one of the projects that I carried out in the     s used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding. We can now trace back to    billion years. We've learned over time that stars have individual histories  that is  they have birth  they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths. So the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see  most of which turn out to have planets going around them. And one of the really surprising results in the last    years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars. These are called exoplanets. And until       we didn't even know the existence of any other planets  other than going around our own sun. But now  there are almost       other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect  measure masses for. There are     of those that are multiple planet systems. And there are          and still counting    other candidates for planets orbiting other stars. They come in a bewildering variety of different kinds. There are Jupiter like planets that are hot  there are other planets that are icy  there are water worlds and there are rocky planets like the Earth  so called  super Earths   and there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds. So we know there's at least one planet  our own Earth  in which there is life. We've even found planets that are orbiting two stars. That's no longer the province of science fiction. So around our own planet  we know there's life  we've developed a complex life  we now can question our own origins. And given all that we've discovered  the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions  perhaps    maybe even hundreds of millions    of other  planets  that are close enough    just the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting    to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life. So we marvel now at those odds  the overwhelming odds  and the amazing thing is that within the next decade  the GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets  and determine whether or not they have the potential for life. So  what is the GMT project  It's an international project. It includes Australia  South Korea  and I'm happy to say  being here in Rio  that the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil. It also includes a number of institutions across the United States  including Harvard University  the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions  and the Universities of Arizona  Chicago  Texas Austin and Texas A M University. It also involves Chile. So  the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating in its own right. Take chunks of glass  melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating. This happens underneath the football stadium at the University of Arizona. It's tucked away under        seats. Nobody know it's happening. And there's essentially a rotating cauldron. The mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly  and then they're polished to an exquisite precision. And so  if you think about the precision of these mirrors  the bumps on the mirror  over the entire    feet  amount to less than one millionth of an inch. So  can you visualize that  Ow  That's one five thousandths of the width of one of my hairs  over this entire    feet. It's a spectacular achievement. It's what allows us to have the precision that we will have. So  what does that precision buy us  So the GMT  if you can imagine    if I were to hold up a coin  which I just happen to have  and I look at the face of that coin  I can see from here the writing on the coin  I can see the face on that coin. My guess that even in the front row  you can't see that. But if we were to turn the Giant Magellan Telescope  all    feet diameter that we see in this auditorium  and point it     miles away  if I were standing in S o Paulo  we could resolve the face of this coin. That's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope. And if we were    If an astronaut went up to the Moon  a quarter of a million miles away  and lit a candle    a single candle    then we would be able to detect it  using the GMT. Quite extraordinary. This is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.  Nearby  is astronomical  it's all relative. It's tens of millions of light years away. This is what this cluster would look like. So look at those four bright objects  and now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. You can see faint detail that starts to come through. And now finally    and look how dramatic this is    this is what the GMT will see. So  keep your eyes on those bright images again. This is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth  and this  again  what the GMT will see. Extraordinary precision. So  where are we  We have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile. We blasted that off. We've tested and polished the first mirror. We've cast the second and the third mirrors. And we're about to cast the fourth mirror. We had a series of reviews this year  international panels that came in and reviewed us  and said   You're ready to go to construction.  And so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors. We want to get on the air quickly  and be taking science data    what we astronomers call  first light   in     . And the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade  with all seven mirrors. So we're now poised to look back at the distant universe  the cosmic dawn. We'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail. But for me  one of the most exciting things about building the GMT is the opportunity to actually discover something that we don't know about    that we can't even imagine at this point  something completely new. And my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities  that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars. Thank you very much. Obrigado. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Wendy. Stay with me  because I have a question for you. You mentioned different facilities. So the Magellan Telescope is going up  but also ALMA and others in Chile and elsewhere  including in Hawaii. Is it about cooperation and complementarity  or about competition  I know there's competition in terms of funding  but what about the science  Wendy Freedman  In terms of the science  they're very complementary. The telescopes that are in space  the telescopes on the ground  telescopes with different wavelength capability  telescopes even that are similar  but different instruments    they will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking. So when we discover other planets  we'll be able to test those observations  we'll be able to measure the atmospheres  be able to look in space with very high resolution. So  they're very complementary. You're right about the funding  we compete  but scientifically  it's very complementary. BG  Wendy  thank you very much for coming to TEDGlobal. WF  Thank you.
