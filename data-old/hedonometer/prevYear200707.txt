I've been at MIT for    years. I went to TED I. There's only one other person here  I think  who did that. All the other TEDs    and I went to them all  under Ricky's regime    I talked about what the Media Lab was doing  which today has almost     people in it. And if you read the press  last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab. I didn't quit the Media Lab  I stepped down as chairman    which was a kind of ridiculous title  but someone else has taken it on    and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor. And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child  which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half  anyway. So I'm going to tell you about this  use my    minutes to tell you why we're doing it  how we're doing it and then what we're doing. And at some point I'll even pass around what the      laptop might be like. I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues  and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this. And the first is pretty obvious. It's amazing when you meet a head of state  and you say   What is your most precious natural resource   They will not say  children  at first  and then when you say   children   they will pretty quickly agree with you. And so that isn't very hard. Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems  they include education  sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education. So that's certainly part of it. And the third is a little bit less obvious. And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk  how to talk  not by being taught how to talk  or taught how to walk  but by interacting with the world  by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something  or being able to stand up and reach it. Whereas at about the age six  we were told to stop learning that way  and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching  whether it's people standing up  like I'm doing now  or a book  or something. But it was really through teaching. And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking  in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself. So with those as the principles    some of you may know Seymour Papert. This is back in       when we were working in Senegal. Because some people think that the      laptop just happened a year ago  or two years ago  or we were struck by lightning    this actually has gone back a long time  and in fact  back to the '  s. Here we're in the '  s. Steve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal. It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids  even though English wasn't their language  the Latin alphabet barely was their language  but they could just swim like fish. They could play these like pianos. A little bit more recently  I got involved personally. And these are two anecdotes    one was in Cambodia  in a village that has no electricity  no water  no television  no telephone  but has broadband Internet now. And these kids  their first English word is  Google  and they only know Skype. They've never heard of telephony. They just use Skype. And they go home at night    they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity. The parents love it  because when they open up the laptops  it's the brightest light source in the house. And talk about where metaphors and reality mix    this is the actual school. In parallel with this  Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year     . Now at the time  I think it's fair to say that    percent of the teachers were    let me say  apprehensive. Really  they were actually against it. And they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries  more schools  whatever. And now  three and a half years later  guess what  They're reporting five things  drop of truancy to almost zero  attending parent teacher meetings    which nobody did and now almost everybody does    drop in discipline problems  increase in student participation. Teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach. Kids are engaged    they have laptops     and then the fifth  which interests me the most  is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night because the teachers are getting too much email from the kids asking them for help. So when you see that kind of thing    this is not something that you have to test. The days of pilot projects are over  when people say   We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works.  Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it  and then when you figure out that this works  you can join as well. And this is what we're doing. So  One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago. It's a nonprofit association. It raised about    million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built  and then have it produced afterwards. Scale is truly important. And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price  OK  It's because you can go to a manufacturer    and I will leave the name out    but we wanted a small display  doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity. It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright. And this particular manufacturer said   We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room. We're interested in perfect color uniformity. We're interested in big displays  bright displays. You're not part of our strategic plan.  And I said   That's kind of too bad  because we need     million units a year.  And they said   Oh  well  maybe we could become part of your strategic plan.  And that's why scale counts. And that's why we will not launch this without five to    million units in the first run. And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down  and that's why I said seven to    million there. And we're doing it without a sales and marketing team. I mean  you're looking at the sales and marketing team. We will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it  and then the others can follow. We have partners. It's not hard to guess Google would be one. The others are all playing to pending. And this has been in the press a great deal. It's the so called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia. Now once people start looking at this  they say   Ah  this is a laptop project.  Well  no  it's not a laptop project. It's an education project. And the fun part    and I'm quite focused on it    I tell people I used to be a light bulb  but now I'm a laser    I'm just going to get that thing built  and it turns out it's not so hard. Because laptop economics are the following  I say    percent here    it's more like        percent of the cost of your laptop is sales  marketing  distribution and profit. Now we have none of those  OK  None of those figure into our cost  because first of all  we sell it at cost  and the governments distribute it. It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook. So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else. Now the display on your laptop costs  in rough numbers     dollars a diagonal inch. That can drop to eight  it can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two  or to one and a half  unless we do some pretty clever things. It's the rest    that little brown box    that is pretty fascinating  because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself. It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity. And we have a situation today which is incredible. I've been using laptops since their inception. And my laptop runs slower  less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before. And this year is worse. People clap  sometimes you even get standing ovations  and I say   What the hell's wrong with you  Why are we all sitting there   And somebody    to remain nameless    called our laptop a  gadget  recently. And I said   God  our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell. When you open it up  it's going to go 'bing.'  It'll be on. It'll be just like it was in       when you bought an Apple Macintosh    . It worked really well. And we've been going steadily downhill. Now  people ask all the time what it is. That's what it is. The two pieces that are probably notable  it'll be a mesh network  so when the kids open up their laptops  they all become a network  and then just need one or two points of backhaul. You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits. So you really can bring into a village  and then the villages can connect themselves  and you really can do it quite well. The dual mode display    the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors    isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight  Well  you can't see it. And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time  most cell phones. Now  what we're doing is  we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit. And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen. But when it's backlit  it's color. And when it's frontlit  it's black and white at three times the resolution. Is it all worked out  No. That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now. And in about    days  we'll know for sure whether this works. Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance. And this is again something that people don't believe  but I really think it's quite true. That's the machine we showed in Tunis. This is more the direction that we're going to go. And it's something that we didn't think was possible. Now  I'm going to pass this around. This isn't a design  OK  So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. And it's clearly just a model. The working one is at MIT. I'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman. At least you can decide whether it goes left or    Chris Anderson  Before you do it  for the people down in simulcast    Nicholas Negroponte  Sorry  I forgot. CA  Just show it off a bit. So wherever the camera is    OK  good point. Thank you  Chris. The idea was that it would be not only a laptop  but that it could transform into an electronic book. So it's sort of an electronic book. This is where when you go outside  it's in black and white. The games buttons are missing  but it'll also be a games machine  book machine. Set it up this way  and it's a television set. Etc.  etc.    is that enough for simulcast  OK  sorry. I'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards. OK. Seven countries. I say  maybe  for Massachusetts  because they actually have to do a bid. By law you've got to bid  and so on and so forth. So I can't quite name them. In the other cases  they don't have to do bids. They can decide    it's the federal government in each case. It's kind of agonizing  because a lot of people say   Let's do it at the state level   because states are more nimble than the feds  just because of size. And yet we count. We're really dealing with the federal government. We're really dealing with ministries of education. And if you look at governments around the world  ministries of education tend to be the most conservative  and also the ones that have huge payrolls. Everybody thinks they know about education  a lot of culture is built into it as well. It's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road. If you look at the countries  they're pretty geoculturally distributed. Have they all agreed  No  not completely. Probably Thailand  Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed. We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months  I'm just going around the world every three weeks. Here's sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting. Everybody says it's a      laptop    you can't do it. Well  guess what  we're not. We're coming in probably at      to start  then drift down. And that's very important  because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up. It's kind of the loss leader  and then as soon as it looks interesting  it can't be afforded  or it can't be scaled out. So we're targeting    dollars in     . The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways    just one    but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique    It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles    thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States. Not one single post office truck is stolen. And why  Because there's no market for post office trucks. It looks like a post office truck. You can spray paint it. You can do anything you want. I just learned recently  in South Africa  no white Volvos are stolen. Period. None. Zero. So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo. Each government has a task force. This perhaps is less interesting  but we're trying to get the governments to all work together and it's not easy. The economics of this is to start with the federal governments and then later  to subsequently go to other    whether it's child to child funding  so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world  maybe of the same gender  maybe of the same age. An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present. I mean  there are all sorts of things that will happen  and they'll be very  very exciting. And everybody says    I say    it's an education project. Are we providing the software  The answer is  The system certainly has software  but no  we're not providing the education content. That is really done in the countries. But we are certainly constructionists. And we certainly believe in learning by doing and everything from Logo  which was started in       to more modern things  like Scratch  if you've ever even heard of it  are very  very much part of it. And that's the rollout. Are we dreaming  Is this real  It actually is real. The only criticism  and people really don't want to criticize this  because it is a humanitarian effort  a nonprofit effort and to criticize it is a little bit stupid  actually. But the one thing that people could criticize was   Great idea  but these guys can't do it.  And that could either mean these guys  professors and so on couldn't do it  or that it's not possible. Well  on December     a company called Quanta agreed to build it  and since they make about one third of all the laptops on the planet today  that question disappeared. So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen. It is going to happen. And if it comes out at     dollars  so what  If it comes out six months late  so what  That's a pretty soft landing. Thank you. I'm really excited to be here today. I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab  literally  and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to see it in person  because I really think this is going to really change the way we interact with machines from this point on. Now  this is a rear projected drafting table. It's about    inches wide and it's equipped with a multi touch sensor. Normal touch sensors that you see  like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards  can only register one point of contact at a time. This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time. They can use both my hands  I can use chording actions  I can just go right up and use all    fingers if I wanted to. You know  like that. Now  multi touch sensing isn't completely new. People like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '  s. However  the approach I built here is actually high resolution  low cost  and probably most importantly  very scalable. So  the technology  you know  isn't the most exciting thing here right now  other than probably its newfound accessibility. What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it. So let's see. So  for instance  we have a lava lamp application here. Now  you can see  I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together. I can inject heat into the system here  or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers. It's completely intuitive  there's no instruction manual. The interface just kind of disappears. This started out as a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students in our lab  Ilya Rosenberg  made. But I think its true identity comes out here. Now what's great about a multi touch sensor is that  you know  I could be doing this with as many fingers here  but of course multi touch also inherently means multi user. Chris could be interacting with another part of Lava  while I play around with it here. You can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool  where I'm kind of warming something up  making it malleable  and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state. Google should have something like this in their lobby. I'll show you a little more of a concrete example here  as this thing loads. This is a photographer's light box application. Again  I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around. But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers  I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily. I can pan  zoom and rotate it effortlessly. I can do that grossly with both of my hands  or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together. If I grab the canvas  I can do the same thing    stretch it out. I can do it simultaneously  holding this down  and gripping on another one  stretching this out. Again  the interface just disappears here. There's no manual. This is exactly what you expect  especially if you haven't interacted with a computer before. Now  when you have initiatives like the      laptop  I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new generation to computing with this standard mouse and windows pointer interface. This is something that I think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from now on. Now  of course  I can bring up a keyboard. And I can bring that around  put that up there. Obviously  this is a standard keyboard  but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands. That's really important  because there's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming to a physical device. That leads to bad things  like RSI. We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us. There's so little applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces from this point on. This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go. You can imagine  in the future  as we develop this kind of technology  a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away  and really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke. So    again  isn't this great  Audience  Where's your lab  Jeff Han  I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York. Here's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls. It'll remember the strokes I'm making. Of course I can do it with all my hands. It's pressure sensitive. What's neat about that is  I showed that two finger gesture that zooms in really quickly. Because you don't have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool  you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales  all at the same time. I can create big things out here  but I can go back and really quickly go back to where I started  and make even smaller things here. This is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization. For instance  I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk  and he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time  We have all this great data  but for some reason  it's just sitting there. We're not accessing it. And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools  but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces  to be able to drill down into this kind of data  while still thinking about the big picture here. Let me show you another app here. This is called WorldWind. It's done by NASA. We've all seen Google Earth  this is an open source version of that. There are plug ins to be able to load in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years. As you can see  I can use the same two fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface  again. It really allows anybody to kind of go in    and it just does what you'd expect  you know  Again  there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears. I can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here. NASA's really cool. These hyper spectral images are false colored so you can    it's really good for determining vegetative use. Well  let's go back to this. The great thing about mapping applications    it's not really  D  it's  D. So  again  with a multi point interface  you can do a gesture like this    so you can be able to tilt around like that    It's not just simply relegated to a kind of  D panning and motion. This gesture is just putting two fingers down    it's defining an axis of tilt    and I can tilt up and down that way. We just came up with that on the spot  it's probably not the right thing to do  but there's such interesting things you can do with this interface. It's just so much fun playing around with it  too. And so the last thing I want to show you is    I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this. Now  here's a simple application here    I can draw out a curve. And when I close it  it becomes a character. But the neat thing about it is I can add control points. And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time. And you notice what it does. It's kind of a puppeteering thing  where I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make    Now  there's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing. This technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here  with multiple control points  is actually state of the art. It was released at SIGGRAPH last year. It's a great example of the kind of research I really love  all this compute power to make things do the right things  intuitive things  to do exactly what you expect. So  multi touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI. I'm not the only one doing it  a lot of other people are getting into it. This kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it  I'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields. Thank you. Hi  everyone. I'm Sirena. I'm    years old and from Connecticut. Well  I'm not really sure why I'm here. I mean  what does this have to do with technology  entertainment and design  Well  I count my iPod  cellphone and computer as technology  but this has nothing to do with that. So I did a little research on it. Well  this is what I found. Of course  I hope I can memorize it. The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings. By pulling a string  it vibrates and produces a sound wave  which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge  and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified  but ... let me think. Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length  and that changes the frequency of the sound wave. OK  this is sort of technology  but I can call it a   th century technology. But actually  the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound. Isn't that cool  Design    I love its design. I remember when I was little  my mom asked me   Would you like to play the violin or the piano   I looked at that giant monster and said to myself     I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day   This is small and lightweight. I can play from standing  sitting or walking. And  you know what  The best of all is that if I don't want to practice  The violin is very beautiful. Some people relate it as the shape of a lady. But whether you like it or not  it's been so for more than     years  unlike modern stuff  that  easily looks dated. But I think it's very personal and unique that  although each violin looks pretty similar  no two violins sound the same    even from the same maker or based on the same model. Entertainment    I love the entertainment. But actually  the instrument itself isn't very entertaining. I mean  when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it  it was actually really bad  because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids    it was so horrible and so scratchy. So  it wasn't entertaining at all. But besides  my brother found this very funny  Yuk  Yuk  Yuk  A few years later  I heard a joke about the greatest violinist  Jascha Heifetz. After Mr. Heifetz's concert  a lady came over and complimented him   Oh  Mr. Heifetz  your violin sounded so great tonight   And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person  so he picked up his violin and said   Funny    I don't hear anything.  Now I realize that as the musician  we human beings  with our great mind  artistic heart and skill  can change this   th century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. Now I know why I'm here. At first  I thought I was just going to be here to perform  but unexpectedly  I learned and enjoyed much more. But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me. Like the multi dimension stuff. I mean  honestly  I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school. But actually  the most impressive thing to me is that    well  actually  I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults  for actually caring for us a lot  and to make our future world much better. Thank you. Thank you  Thank you very much. Like the speaker before me    I am a TED virgin  I guess. I'm also the first time here  and ... I don't know what to say  I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me. I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone. And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann. It's called  Kaleidoscope.  And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late   th century  and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time. I have another piece that I'd like to play for you. It's called  Abegg Variations   by Robert Schumann  a German   th century composer. The name  Abegg  is actually A B E G G  and that's the main theme in the melody. That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends. But he wrote that for his wife. So actually  if you listen carefully  there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme. It's written around       so even though it's old  I hope you'll like it. Now comes the part that I hate. Well  because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called  Sync and Flow   I was wondering   What do I know that these geniuses don't   So  I'll talk about musical composition  even though I don't know where to start. How do I compose  I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose. What I do first is  I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano    and I choose one of those to become my main theme  my main melody  like the Abegg that you just heard. And once I choose my main theme  I have to decide  Out of all the styles in music  what kind of style do I want  And this year  I composed a Romantic style. So for inspiration  I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers. Next  I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers. They help me plan out the whole piece. And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas  because then you have to think. And then  when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form    solidified  excuse me    solidified form  you're supposed to actually polish the piece  polish the details  and then polish the overall performance of the composition. And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing. Drawing  because I like to draw  you know  Japanese anime art. I think that's a craze among teens right now. And once I realized it  there's a parallel between creating music and creating art  because for your motive  or your little initial idea for your drawing  it's your character    you want to decide who you want to draw  or if you want to draw an original character. And then you want to decide  How are you going to draw the character  Like  am I going to use one page  Am I going to draw it on the computer  Am I going to use a two page spread like a comic book  For a more grandiose effect  I guess. And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character  which is like your structure of a piece  and then you add pen and pencil  and whatever details that you need    that's polishing the drawing. And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind  because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted. So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it  I'll try to draw or  you know  waste my time. And then what happens is  sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all  and then it's like there's too much on your mind. You can't focus on what you're supposed to do. And sometimes  if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it  you'll get something out of it  but it doesn't come naturally. What happens is  if something magical happens  if something natural happens to you  you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly  and then that's what I consider  flow   because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything. You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want. I'm not going to play my own composition today because  although I did finish it  it's way too long. Instead  I'd like to try something called  improvisation.  I have here seven note cards  one with each note of the musical alphabet. And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five    anyone to come up here and choose five    and then I can make it into some sort of melody  and I'll improvise it. Wow. A volunteer  yay  Jennifer Lin  Nice to meet you. Goldie Hawn  Thank you. Choose five  JL  Yes  five cards. Any five cards. GH  OK  one. JL  OK. GH  Two. JL  Yes. GH  Three. GH  Oh  D and F    too familiar. JL  One more. GH  OK.  E  for  effort.  JL  Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them  GH  OK    C  G  B  A and E. JL  Thank you very much  GH  You're welcome. And what about these  JL  I won't use them. Thank you  Now  she chose C  G  B  A  E. I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order. OK  that's nice. So  I'm going to have a moment to think  and I'll try to make something out of it. The next song  or the encore that I'm going to play is called  Bumble Boogie   by Jack Fina. In terms of invention  I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects. I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on  but I think it's also the simplest. It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet  the number one cause of death in children under five. Which is ...  Water borne diseases  Diarrhea  Malnutrition  No. It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires    acute respiratory infections caused by this. Can you believe that  I find this shocking and somewhat appalling. Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels  Can't we make better stoves  How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year  I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes  so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro tubes  which is charcoal. So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now    percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this all over the island. It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation. A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths    that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil. So the rains come    they go down the rivers and the flooding happens. Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this  people need to cook  and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage. They know perfectly well  but they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available  and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree  cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly  there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels. About four years ago  I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked. And the idea was that you could take waste paper  you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes  they were able to triple the throughput of this device. So you could imagine they were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them. And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little discouraging to the students. And in fact  if you look closely  right here you can see it says   US Peace Corps.  As it turns out  there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village  it was     kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel. What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called  bagasse.  It has no other use. It has no nutritional value  so they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with  something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years  students and I worked to develop a process. So you start with the bagasse  and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five gallon oil drum. After some time  after setting it on fire  you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln  and then you end up with this carbonized material here. However  you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently  one of my students was from Ghana  and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called  kokonte   which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked  and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti  under the name of  manioc.  In fact  it's grown all over the world    yucca  tapioca  manioc  cassava  it's all the same thing    a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick  sticky porridge out of it  which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon  or Charcoal Institute. And these    That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made. Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti  this produces really smoky fires  and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel. Kids and women are especially affected by it  because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires. So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal making technology there. Well  unfortunately  they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava  but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure  which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side by side tests  and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel. And in fact  it heats the water a lot more quickly. And so we were very happy  thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side by side comparisons with wood charcoal  it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. So we went back to MIT  we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it  And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this  we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process  to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there. And after some time  we developed a low cost press that allows you to produce charcoal  which actually now burns not only    actually  it burns longer  cleaner than wood charcoal. So now we're in a situation where we have a product  which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace  which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone  about    million trees are cut down every year. There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition  the revenue generated from that charcoal is     million dollars. That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti    with a population of eight million and an average income of less than     dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project. And one of the things that I think is also interesting  is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide  you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable  but up until now  there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel. One of the really exciting things  though  is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing  and it's even lower tech than what you just saw  if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this  This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes    it comes ready made. This is my      laptop  right here. And actually  like Nick  I brought samples. So we can pass these around. They're fully functional  field tested  ready to roll out. And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology  is that the technology transfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal  where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder  this comes pre briquetted. And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now  which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life. But once you see it  like you guys in the front row    All right  yeah  OK. So anyway    Here it is. And this is  I think  a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non zero sum things. So not only do you have health benefits  you have environmental benefits. But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare that you don't have trade offs between health and economics  or environment and economics. So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us. So when we talk about  now  the future we will create  one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in. And now  I don't actually mean the world that we live in. I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand  and where  when you work    hours a day  you're still only earning    dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend    billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water. It's a place where  for example  if this were India  in this room  only three of us would have a car. If this were Afghanistan  only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia        of you would be farmers      of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers  our designers  our business people  our entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions that we need to find. I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro finance and micro enterprise  so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out    and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making  poultry rearing  etc. But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale. The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink our development strategies  so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers  but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think about how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future  and we need to start doing it now. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you  incredible. Stay here. Tell us    just while we see if someone has a question    just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on. Amy Smith  Some of the other things we're working on are ways to do low cost water quality testing  so that communities can maintain their own water systems  know when they're working  know when they treat them  etc. We're also looking at low cost water treatment systems. One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that. CA  What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale  Do you need to find entrepreneurs  or venture capitalists  or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale  AS  I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing    it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward. And we're a pretty small staff  which is me. So  you know  I do what I can with the students. We have    students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward. The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame  as  you know  you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years  you have to be looking five or    years ahead. But I think with the vision to do that  we can move forward. My name is Lovegrove. I only know nine Lovegroves  two of which are my parents. They are first cousins  and you know what happens when  you know    So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me  which I'm fighting with all the time. So to try and get through today  I've kind of disciplined myself with an    minute talk. I was hanging on to have a pee. I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough  that would guide me through the    minutes. OK. I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position. But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people's soul and emotion. Not very long ago  not many thousands of years ago  we actually lived in caves  and I don't think we've lost that coding system. We respond so well to form. But I'm interested in creating intelligent form. I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design. This artificially induced consumerism    I think it's atrocious. My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins  Janine Benyus  James Watson. I'm in that world  but I work purely instinctively. I'm not a scientist. I could have been  perhaps  but I work in this world where I trust my instincts. So I am a   st century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with. And we should be developing things    we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use. So  the water bottle. I'll begin with this concept of what I call DNA. DNA  Design  Nature  Art. These are the three things that condition my world. Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci      years ago  before photography. It shows how observation  curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art. Industrial design is the art form of the   st century. People like Leonardo    there have not been many    had this amazingly instinctive curiosity. I work from a similar position. I don't want to sound pretentious saying that  but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago    well into the   st century      years later. It's my impression of water. Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it      million dollars  easily  for a Monet. I use  now  a whole new process. A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn  Thom Mayne  Zaha Hadid  Rem Koolhaas    all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form. This is all created digitally. Here you see the machining  the milling of a block of acrylic. This is what I show to the client to say   That's what I want to do.  At that point  I don't know if that's possible at all. It's a seductor  but I just feel in my bones that that's possible. So we go  we look at the tooling. We look at how that is produced. These are the invisible things that you never see in your life. This is the background noise of industrial design. That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra. It is more valuable than the product in my eyes. I don't have one. When I do make some money  I'll have one machined for myself. This is the final product. When they sent it to me  I thought I'd failed. It felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing. It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself. It's an icon of water itself  and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design. Each bottle is different  meaning the water level will give you a different shape. It's mass individualism from a single product. It fits the hand. It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands. It makes the product strong  the tessellation. It's a millefiori of ideas. In the future  they will look like that  because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things  perhaps  in life. Biopolymers  these new ideas for materials  will come into play in probably a decade. It doesn't look as cool  does it  But I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that. I design for that condition  biopolymers. It's the future. I took this video in Cape Town last year. This is the freaky side coming out. I have this special interest in things like this  which blow my mind. I don't know whether to  you know  drop to my knees  cry  I don't know what I think. But I just know that nature    nature improves with ever greater purpose that which once existed  and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking. When I look at these things  they look pretty normal to me. But these things evolved over many years  and what we're trying to do    I get three weeks to design a telephone. How the hell do I do that  when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve  How do you condense that  It comes back to instinct. I'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that and I'm not looking at designing architecture like that. I'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates. How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand. This is a scan through the human forearm. It's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure. I have these in my office. My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab. It's a weird  kind of freaky place. This is one of my specimens. This is made    bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers. I studied cooking in school for four years  and in that experience  which was called  domestic science   it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification. Actually  I put marijuana in everything I cooked    And I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous. All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand. Anyway    this is a meringue. This is another sample I have. A meringue is made exactly the same way  in my estimation  as a bone. It's made from polysaccharides and proteins. If you pour water on that  it dissolves. Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future  Not a bad idea. I don't know. I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that  but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something  a car    I don't know. I'm also interested in growth patterns  the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all. These interrelated forms  they do inspire everything I do  although I might end up making something incredibly simple. This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium. It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of  kind of  engineering and biological thinking  shown pretty much as a bone structure. Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object. It's the world's first chair made in magnesium. It cost  .  million dollars to develop. It's called  Go   by Bernhardt  USA. It went into Time magazine in      as the new language of the   st century. Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village  that's enough. It shows how you make one holistic form  like the car industry  and then you break up what you need. This is an absolutely beautiful way of working. It's a godly way of working. It's organic and it's essential. It's an absolutely fat free design  and when you look at it  you see human beings. When that moves into polymers  you can change the elasticity  the fluidity of the form. This is an idea for a gas injected  one piece polymer chair. What nature does is it drills holes in things. It liberates form. It takes away anything extraneous. That's what I do. I make organic things which are essential. And they look funky  too    but I don't set out to make funky things because I think that's an absolute disgrace. I set out to look at natural forms. If you took the idea of fractal technology further  take a membrane  shrinking it down constantly like nature does    that could be a seat for a chair. It could be a sole for a sports shoe. It could be a car blending into seats. Wow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff. This is what exists in nature. Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day. That's what I do. This is a show that's currently on in Tokyo. It's called  Superliquidity.  It's my sculptural investigation. It's like   st century Henry Moore. When you see a Henry Moore  still  your hair stands up. There's some amazing spiritual connect. If he was a car designer  phew  we'd all be driving one. In his day  he was the highest taxpayer in Britain. That is the power of organic design. It contributes immensely to our    sense of being  our sense of relationships with things  our sensuality and  you know  the sort of    even the sort of socio erotic side  which is very important. This is my artwork. This is all my process. These actually are sold as artwork. They're very big prints. But this is how I get to that object. Ironically  that object was made by the Killarney process  which is a brand new process here for the   st century  and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that. I'll tell you about that later. When I look into these data images  I see new things. It's self inspired. Diatomic structures  radiolaria  the things that we couldn't see but we can do now    these  again  are cored out. They're made virtually from nothing. They're made from silica. Why not structures from cars like that  Coral  all these natural forces  take away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty. We need to be in that realm. I want to do stuff like that. This is a new chair which should come on the market in September. It's for a company called Moroso in Italy. It's a gas injected polymer chair. Those holes you see there are very filtered down  watered down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures. It goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see    there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing. It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming. If you see the shadows that come through that  they're actually probably more important than the product  but it's the minimum it takes. The coring out of the back lets you breathe. It takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too. I was going to break into a dance then. This is some current work I'm doing. I'm looking at single surface structures and how they stretch and flow. It's based on furniture typologies  but that's not the end motivation. It's made from aluminum ... as opposed to aluminium  and it's grown. It's grown in my mind  and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through. This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry  who build parts for Bentleys and so on. It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York. I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers. When I see these animations  oh Jesus  I'm blown away. This is what goes on in my studio everyday. I walk    I'm traveling. I come back. Some guy's got that on a computer    there's this like  oh my goodness. So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio. This kind of effervescent    fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas. Single surface products. Furniture's a good one. How you grow legs out of a surface. I would love to build this one day and perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour  sugar  polymer  wood chips    I don't know  human hair. I don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time. That's the weird side coming out again. A lot of companies don't understand that. Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo. They said   Give us the dream. What is our dream  How do we beat Apple   I said   You don't copy Apple  that's for sure. You get into biopolymers.  They looked straight through me. What a waste. Anyway. No  it's true. Fuck them. You know  I mean    I'm delivering  they're not taking. I've had this image    years. I've had this image of a water droplet for    years  sitting on a hot bed. That is an image of a car for me. That's the car of the future. It's a water droplet. I've been banging on about this like I can't believe. Cars are all wrong. I'm going to show you something a bit weird now. They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this. The only place that didn't laugh was Moscow. Cars are made from        components. How ridiculous is that  Couldn't you make that from      It's got a vacuum formed  carbon nylon pan. Everything's holistically integrated. It opens and closes like a bread bin. There is no engine. There's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels  they're fitted like Formula  . You take them off your wall  you plug them in. Off you go. A three wheeled car  slow  feminine  transparent  so you can see the people in there. You drive different. You see that thing. You do. You do. And not anesthetized  separated from life. There's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that. It's a city car. You drive along. You get out. You drive on to a proboscis. You get out. It lifts you up. It presents the solar panel to the sun  and at night  it's a street lamp. That's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first  and do the car second. I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages  floating around on the ground  driven by AI. When I showed this in South Africa  everybody afterwards was going   Hey  car on a stick. Like this.  Can you imagine  A car on a stick. If you put it next to contemporary architecture  it feels totally natural to me. And that's what I do with my furniture. I'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore. I'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture. I'm trying to build transportation systems. I work on aircraft for Airbus  I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural  inspired by nature dreams home. I'm going to finish on two things. This is the stereolithography of a staircase. It's a little bit of a dedication to James  James Watson. I built this thing for my studio. It cost me         dollars to build this. Most people go and buy the Aston Martin. I built this. This is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex. Took about two years  because I'm looking for fat free design. Lean  efficient things. Healthy products. This is built by composites. It's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element  and this is a carbon fiber handrail which is only supported in two places. Modern materials allow us to do modern things. This is a shot in the studio. This is how it looks pretty much every day. You wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it. There is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards. Who cares  And it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength. It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean. It's in Notting Hill  next to all the crap    the prostitutes and all that stuff. It's next to David Hockney's original studio. It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day. My guys go out for lunch. The door's open. They come back in  because it's normally raining and they prefer to stay in. This is my studio. Elephant skull from Oxford University      . I bought that last year. They're very difficult to find. If anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me  I'll put it in the studio. So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video. It's a homemade video  made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that. You never see architects or designers showing you their real world. This is called a  Plasnet.  It's a new bio polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy. World's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars. We should all be riding one of these. As China buys all these crappy cars  we should be riding things like this. Counterbalance. Like I say  it's a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory. It's full of prototypes and objects. It's self inspirational  again. I mean  the rare times when I'm there  I do enjoy it. And I get lots and lots of kids coming. I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers    wankers. Sorry. That's a solar seed. It's a concept for new architecture. That thing on the top is the world's first solar powered garden lamp    the first produced. Giles Revell should be talking here today    amazing photography of things you can't see. The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo. Lots of stuff. There's a little leaf chair    that golden looking thing is called  Leaf.  It's made from Kevlar. On the wall is my book called  Supernatural   which allows me to remember what I've done  because I forget. There's an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year  in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture. Gernot Oberfell  working at three o'clock in the morning    and I don't pay overtime. Overtime is the passion of design  so join the club or don't. No  it's true. People like Tom and Greg    we're traveling like you can't    we fit it all in. I don't know how we do it. Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden  then I'm in Beijing on Friday. You work that one out. And when I see Ed's photographs  I think  why the hell am I going to China  It's true. It's true. Because there's a soul in this whole thing. We need to have a new instinct for the   st century. We need to combine all this stuff. If all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together  it would be a joy  absolute joy. So there's a new X light system I'm doing in Japan. There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa. There's a Kifwebe mask. These are my sculptures. A copper jelly mold. It sounds like some quiz show or something  doesn't it  So  it's going to end. Thank you  James  for your great inspiration. Thank you very much. I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days. So many different points of resonance that it's going to be difficult to bring them all up  but I'll try to do my best. Does anybody remember these  OK  so these are LP records and they've been replaced  right  They've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world flattening digitization technologies  right  And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today. What's happened in the music world is there's a culture  or an ecosystem that's been created that  if you take some words from Apple  the catchphrase    that we create  rip  mix and burn. What I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas. Anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas  use them in innovative ways. Anyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways  draw connections between musical ideas  and people can burn them or create final products and continue the circle. And what that's done is it's created  like I said  a vibrant community that's very inclusive  with people continually working to connect musical ideas  innovate them and keep things constantly up to date. Today's hit single is not last year's hit single. But I'm not here to talk about music today. I'm here to talk about books. In particular  textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school. Has anyone here ever been to school  OK  does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools  around the world  I'm not going to spend too much time on that  but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book. That in fact  the publishing process    just because of the fact that it's complicated  it's heavy  books are expensive    creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books  be they teachers  students or just general readers. And this is even more true if you happen to speak a language other than one of the world's major languages  and especially English. I'm going to call these people below the barrier  shutouts  because they're really shut out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world. And so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books  using them and teaching from them. So  that's what I'd like to talk about and  really  how we get from where we are now to where we need to go. The first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment. Imagine taking all the world's books. OK  everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages. So  liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast  interconnected  global repository. Think of it as a massive iTunes for book type content. And then take that material and imagine making it all open  so that people can modify it  play with it  improve it. Imagine making it free  so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge  and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content  improve it  play with it  on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years. Instead of editions of a book coming out every two years  imagine them coming out every    seconds. So  imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this. So that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors  but all the people who could be or want to be authors in all the different languages of the world  and I think if you could do this  it would be called    I'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem. So  really  this is the dream  and in a sense what you can think of it is we're trying to enable anyone in the world  I mean anyone in the world    to be their own educational DJ  creating educational materials  sharing them with the world  constantly innovating on them. So  this is the dream. In fact  this dream is actually being realized. Over the last six and a half years  we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions  and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions  which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday  where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world. We're working on the open source tools and the content. So  that's sort of to put it in perspective here. So  create. What are some of the people that are using these kind of tools  Well  the first thing is  there's a community of engineering professors  from Cambridge to Kyoto  who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive  super textbook that covers the entire area of electrical engineering. And not only that    it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions. If people like Kitty Jones  a shut out    a private music teacher and mom from Champagne  Illinois  who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world  on how to teach kids how to play music    Her material is now used over         times per month. Tremendous use. In fact  a lot of this use coming from United States K    schools  because anyone who's involved in a school scale back  the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum. And so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open  free content. A lot of teachers are using this stuff. What about ripping  What about copying  reusing  A team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso    graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas. And within about a week  having this be some of our most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America  and in particular in Mexico  because of the open  extensible nature of this. People  volunteers and even companies that are translating materials into Asian languages like Chinese  Japanese and Thai  to spread the knowledge even further. OK  what about people who are mixing  What does  mixing  mean   Mixing  means building customized courses  means building customized books. Companies like National Instruments  who are embedding very powerful  interactive simulations into the materials  so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do. We've been working with Teachers Without Borders  who are very interested in mixing our materials. They're going to be using Connexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach in    countries around the world. TWB is currently in Iraq  training        teachers supported by USAID. And to them  this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important  because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism    that if you don't empower people with the ability to re contextualize the material  translate it into their own language and take ownership of it  it's not good. OK  other organizations we've been working with  UC Merced    people know about UC Merced. It's a new university in California  in the Central Valley  working very closely with community colleges. They're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system. And they're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open source. We've been working with AMD  which has a project called   x    which is trying to bring Internet connectivity to    percent of the world's population by     . We're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages. And we've also been working with a number of other organizations. In particular  a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation  who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content. OK  burn    I think this is  sort of  quite interesting.  Burn  is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses. And I think a lot of you received    I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack. A little present for you. Just to tell you quickly about it  this is an engineering textbook. It's about     pages long  hardbound. This costs    anybody guess  How much would it cost in a bookstore  Richard Baraniuk  OK. This costs    dollars to the student. Why does it cost    dollars  Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials. If this book were to be published by a regular publisher  it would cost at least     dollars. So what we're seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular  sort of single authored book towards community authored materials that are modular  that are customized to each individual class and published on demand very inexpensively  either pushed out through Amazon or published directly through an on demand press  like QOOP. And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing. We're not talking about the Harry Potter end  right at the left side. We're talking about books on hypergeometric partial differential equations. Books that might sell     copies a year        copies a year. There is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours  but also to sustain this new emergence of on demand publishers  like QOOP  who produced these two books. And I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk is that there's an impending cut out the middle man disintermediation  that's going to be happening in the publishing industry. And it's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years  and I think that it's for our benefit  really  and for the world's benefit. OK  so what are the enablers  What's really making all of this happen  There's tons of technology  and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML. How many people know about XML  Oh  great. So it's the future of the web  right  It's semantic representation of content. And what you can really think of XML in this case is it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages. Remember we took the book  tore the pages out  Well  what the XML is going to do is it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks. XML are the nubs on the Lego that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways  and it provides us a framework to share content. So  it lets you take this ecosystem in its primordial state of all this content  all the pages you've torn out of books  and create highly sophisticated learning machines  books  courses  course packs. It gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student  so that every student can have a book or a course that's customized to their learning style  their context  their language and the things that excite them. It lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways  and surprising new ways. It lets you interconnect ideas  indicating how fields relate to each other. And I'll just give you my personal story. We came up with this six and a half years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box. And my day job  as Chris said    I'm an electrical engineering professor. I teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math    Wow  about half of you have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation. But this seemingly dry math is actually the center of this tremendously powerful web that links technology    that links really cool applications like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities  but also governed by intellectual property. And the thing that I realized is there was no way that I  as an engineer  could write this book that would get all of this across. We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas. And I think that really  in a sense  what we're trying to do is make Minsky's dream come to a reality  where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other. And people who are teachers out here    whoever taught  you know this    it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about. OK  back to math. Imagine    this is possible  that every single equation that you click on in one of your new e texts is something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with. So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade. You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it  tinker with it  understand it. Because we really don't understand until we do. The same type of mark up  like MathML  for chemistry. Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed. Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music  play with it  understand it. It's no wonder that everybody's getting into it  right  Even the three wise men. OK  the second big enabler  and this is where I told a big lie. The second big enabler is intellectual property. Because  in fact  I got up here and I talked about how great the music culture is. We can share and rip  mix and burn  but in fact  that's all illegal. And we would be accused of  piracy  for doing that  because this music has been propertized. It's now owned  much of it by big industries. So  really  the key thing here is we can't let this happen. We can't let this Napster thing happen here. So  what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning. And what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable. And the inspiration here is taken from open source software. Things like Linux and the GPL. The Creative Commons licenses. How many people have heard of creative commons  If you have not  you must learn about it. Creativecommons.org. At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects  you can find their logo. Clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no nonsense  human readable document  a deed  that tells you exactly what you can do with this content. In fact  you're free to share it  to do all of these things  to copy it  to change it  even to make commercial use of it  as long as you attribute the author. Because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing  it's really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact. That's why people write  not necessarily making bucks. We're not talking about Harry Potter  right  We're at the long tail end here. Behind that is the legal code  very carefully constructed. And Creative Commons is taking off    over    million things out there  licensed with a Creative Commons license. Not just text  but music  images  video. And there's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re sampling  ripping  mixing  burning and sharing. OK  I'd like to conclude with just the last few points. So  we've built this idea of a commons. People are using it. We get over         unique visitors per month  just to our particular site. MIT OpenCourseWare  which is another large open content site  gets a similar number of hits. But how do we protect this  How do we protect it into the future  And the first thing that people are probably thinking is quality control  right  Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons. Anybody can contribute anything. So that could be a problem. It didn't take long until people started contributing materials  for example  on lingerie  which is actually a pretty good module. The only problem is it's plagiarized from a major French feminist journal  and when you go to the supposed course website  it points to a lingerie selling website. So this is a little bit of a problem. So we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in. You come to TED. Why do you come to TED  Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are very  very high quality  right  And so we need to be able to do the same thing. And we need to be able to design structures  and what we're doing is designing social software to enable anyone to build their own peer review process  and we call these things  lenses.  And basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop their own peer review process  so that they can focus on the content in the repository that they think is really important. And you can think of TED as a potential lens. So I'd just like to end by saying  you can really view this as a call to action. Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge. All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge  and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type  because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing. So  thanks very much. Charles Van Doren  who was later a senior editor of Britannica  said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical    it should stop being safe. But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since       it was anything but radical  still a very completely safe  stodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia  on the other hand  begins with a very radical idea  and that's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia    you just saw the little demonstration of it    it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many  many languages. It's written using wiki software    which is the type of software he just demonstrated    so anyone can quickly edit and save  and it goes live on the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization  he's exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside. So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation  which I founded  a nonprofit organization. And our goal  the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation  is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. And so  if you think about what that means  it means a lot more than just building a cool website. We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide  poverty worldwide  empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model  because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to    they can take our content and do anything they like with it    you can copy it  redistribute it    and you can do it commercially or non commercially. So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We're funded by donations from the public  and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is. But first  I'll show you how big it is. So we've got over         articles in English. We've got two million total articles across many  many different languages. The biggest languages are German  Japanese  French    all the Western European languages are quite big. But only around one third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia  which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very English centric way on the Internet  but for us  we're truly global. We're in many  many languages. How popular we've gotten to be    we're a top    website and we're more popular than the New York Times. So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion. This shows the growth of Wikipedia    we're the blue line there    and this is the New York Times over there. And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge  enormous corporate operation with I have no idea how many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee  and that employee is our lead software developer. And he's only been our employee since January       all the other growth before that ... So the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine. People are always asking   Well  who's in charge of this   or  Who does that   And the answer is  anybody who wants to pitch in. It's a very unusual and chaotic thing. We've got over    servers now in three locations. These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online. I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to    people waiting for me to ask a question or something  anything about the servers. You could never afford to do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people    hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia. So we're doing around  .  billion page views monthly  so it's really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers. And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about       dollars. And that's essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We hired Brian because he was working part time for two years and full time at Wikipedia  so we actually hired him  so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is  why isn't it all rubbish  Why is the website as good as it is  First of all  how good is it  Well  it's pretty good. It isn't perfect  but it's much better than you would expect  given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me  you think   Oh  this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish.  But when we've seen quality tests    and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging people to do more  comparing Wikipedia to traditional things    we win hands down. So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia  which is much  much smaller than English  to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial  and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality  and we were very pleased with that result. So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush Kerry controversy. The media has covered this somewhat extensively. It started out with an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they    I mean  I have to say they spelled my name right  but they really wanted to say the Bush Kerry election is so contentious  it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying   They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.  What I actually said is they're not contentious at all. So it's a slight misquote. The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that  Extreme action sometimes has to be taken  and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of     .  This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for    occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all. Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot  but they don't cause much controversy within the community. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not between the right and the left    that's where most people assume    but it's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities. The actual truth about the specific Bush Kerry incident is that the Bush Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in       and it wasn't because they were contentious  it was just because there was routine vandalism    which happens sometimes even on stage ... Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. And I said    you know  I always say  please don't do that. That's not a good thing. So how do we do this  How do we manage the quality control  How does it work  So there's a few elements  mostly social policies and some elements of the software. So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy. This is something that I set down  from the very beginning  as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable. It's a social concept of cooperation  so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the  truth  about some topic  that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write  because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. But we have this jargon term of neutrality  which has its own long history within the community  which basically says  any time there's a controversial issue  Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done. So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political  religious  cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy  which is non negotiable from the beginning  we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior  you'll be asked to leave the community. So  real time peer review. Every single change on the site goes to the  Recent changes  page. So as soon as he made his change  it went to the  Recent changes  page. That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel  which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds    they can get email notifications of changes. And then users can set up their own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists  because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore  what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly  and then they'll just simply revert the change. There's a  new pages feed   for example  so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted  you know   ASDFASDF.  But also  that's some of the most interesting and fun things  some of the new articles. People will start an article on some interesting topic  other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better. So we do have edits by anonymous users  which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia. So  Chris was able to do his change    he didn't have to log in or anything  he just went on the website and made a change. But it turns out that only about    percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that's a really important thing to understand  the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close knit community of maybe     to       people who are in constant communication. And we have over    IRC channels     mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate. We have off line meetings. These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site  and they are  in a sense  semi professionals at what they're doing. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality. We don't always meet those standards  but that's what we're striving for. And so that tight community is who really cares for the site  and these are some of the smartest people I've ever met. It's my job to say that  but it's actually true. The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people. The tools and the software  there's lots of tools that allow us    allow us  meaning the community    to self monitor and to monitor all the work. This is an example of a page history on  flat Earth   and you can see some changes that were made. What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see   OK  I understand now.  When somebody goes and looks at    they see that someone  an anonymous IP number  made an edit to my page. That sounds suspicious. Who is this person  Somebody looks at it    they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place    to see  OK  well  these words have changed  things like this. So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page. Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open ended. Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open ended in the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules. The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page. So  I mentioned earlier  people type  ASDFASDF     it needs to be deleted. Cases like that  the administrators just delete it. There's no reason to have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is  is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia  Is the information verifiable  Is it a hoax  Is it true  Is it what  So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular example we have here  it's a film   Twisted Issues   and the first person says   Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably.  The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there  because if something's not even in Google  it probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule  but it's a nice starting point for quick research. So somebody says   Delete it  please. Delete it    it's not notable.  And then somebody says   Wait  I found it. I found it in a book  'Film Threat Video Guide  the    Underground Films You Must See.'  So the next persons says   Clean it up.  Somebody says   I've found it on IMDB. Keep  keep  keep.  And what's interesting about this is that the software is    these votes are just text typed into a page. This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day  an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say   OK     deletes  two keeps  we'll delete it.  But in other cases  this could be    deletes and two keeps  and we would keep it  because if those last two keeps say   Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book  and I found a link to a page that describes it  and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow  so please don't delete it   then it would survive. And it also matters who the people are who are voting. Like I say  it's a tight knit community. Down here at the bottom   Keep  real movie   RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism  hoaxes and votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing. So how is all this governed  People really want to know about administrators  things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model  the governance of the community  is a very confusing  but workable mix of consensus    meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles  because the majority view is not necessarily neutral    some amount of democracy    all of the administrators    these are the people who have the ability to delete pages. That doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages. They still have to follow all the rules    but they're elected by the community. Sometimes people    random trolls on the Internet    like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this  because I have no idea how they're elected  actually. There's a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that when I mentioned  like  RickK's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know. I give this talk sometimes with Angela  who was just re elected to the board from the community    to the Board of the Foundation  with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say   Well  Angela  for example  could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia  because she's so admired and so powerful.  But the irony is  of course  that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never  ever break any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say she's the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia  so ... And then there's monarchy  and that's my role on the community  so ... I was describing this in Berlin once  and the next day in the newspaper the headline said   I am the Queen of England.  And that's not exactly what I said  but    the point is my role in the community    Within the free software world  there's been a long standing tradition of the  benevolent dictator  model. So if you look at most of the major free software projects  they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator. Well  I don't like the term  benevolent dictator   and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate. But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy  a certain amount of    sometimes we have to make a decision and we don't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision making processes. So as an example of how this can be important  we recently had a situation where a neo Nazi website discovered Wikipedia  and they said   Oh  well  this is horrible  this Jewish conspiracy of a website  and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process  so we're going to send    we have        members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.  Well  they managed to get    people to show up. That's neo Nazi math for you. They always think they've got        members when they've got   . But they managed to get    people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course  the vote ended up being about    to     so there was no real danger to our democratic processes. On the other hand  people said   But what are we going to do  I mean  this could happen. What if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote   Then I said   Well  fuck it  we'll just change the rules.  That's my job in the community  to say we won't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so  as long as people trust me in my role  then that's a valid place for me. Of course  because of the free licensing  if I do a bad job  the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave    I can't tell anyone what to do. So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works  it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work  but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact  we're very flexible about the social methodology  because ultimately  the passion of the community is for the quality of the work  not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it. Thank you. Ben Saunders  Yeah  hi  Ben Saunders. Jimmy  you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education  Jimmy Wales  Yeah  so  a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia  which I think is false. It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is  there's this crazy thing  Wikipedia  but academics hate it and teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an email from a journalist saying   Why do academics hate Wikipedia   I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there. And I said   Well  they don't all hate it.  But I think there's going to be huge impacts. And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about  which is the Wikibooks project  which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages. And that's a much bigger project. It's going to take    years or so to come to fruition. But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL style CDs. We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world  if I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level  it doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it. The Wikibooks project is an effort to do that. And I think that we're going to see    it may not even come from us  there's all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education. Over the past couple of days  as I've been preparing for my speech  I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people. Being on the same stage as Al Gore  who was the first person I ever voted for. And    So I was getting pretty nervous and  you know  I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage  and that's more nerve racking. But then I started thinking about my family. I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather  and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream    that I had to consider this  my element.  So  who am I  Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband. We have about     people internationally. If you looked in the book  you saw this ... which I really was appalled by. And because I wanted to impress you all with slides  since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs  I made a graph that moves  and I talk about the makeup of me. So  besides this freakish thing  this is my science slide. This is math  and this is science  this is genetics. This is my grandmother  and this is where I get this mouth. So    I'm a blogger  which  probably  to a lot of you  means different things. You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha  where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen  and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock  and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns. You may have heard about Rathergate  which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the  th  in     is not typeset on an old typewriter  it's on Word. Bloggers exposed this  or they worked hard to expose this. You know  blogs are scary. This is what you see. I see this  and I'm sure scared    I swear on stage    shitless about blogs  because this is not something that's friendly. But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media  and these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands  if not millions  of readers  and that's incredibly important. During the hurricane  you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog  updating it frequently. This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools. You have my friend  who has a blog on PVRs  personal recorders. He makes enough money just by running ads  to support his family up in Oregon. That's all he does now  and this is something that blogs have made possible. And then you have something like this  which is Interplast. It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it. Children with cleft palates get it  and they document their story. This is wonderful. I am not that caring. I talk about myself. That's what I am. I'm a blogger. I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing  and I am an expert on this person  and so I write about it. So  the short story about my blog  it started in       I was   . I wasn't happy with my job  because I was a designer  but I wasn't being really stimulated. I was an English major in college. I didn't have any use for it  but I missed writing. So  I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories. This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was    years old  and how I went to a YMCA camp  Christian camp  and basically by the end  I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk  They couldn't find me  they sent a search party  and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself    jumped off Bible Peak. You can laugh  this is OK. This is me. This is what happened to me. And when I started my blog  it was really this one goal    I said   I am not going to be famous to the world  but I could be famous to people on the Internet.  And I set a goal. I said   I'm going to win an award   because I had never won an award in my entire life. And I said   I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award.  And I won it    I reached all of these people  and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day. And then I wrote a post about a banjo. I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo    a      banjo  which is a lot of money. And I don't play instruments  I don't know anything about music. I like music  and I like banjos  and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing  and I said   I could do that.  And I said to my husband   Ben  can I buy a banjo   And he's like   No.  And my husband    this is my husband  who is very hot    he won an award for being hot. He told me   You cannot buy a banjo. You're just like your dad   who collects instruments. And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him  he was such a tyrant    he would not let me buy this banjo. And those people who know me understood my joke    this is Mena  this is how I make a joke at people. Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant  this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog. And if he knew I was showing this right now    I put this in today    he would kill me. But the thing was  my friends read it  and they're like   Oh  that Mena  she wrote a post about wanting a stupid thing and being stupid.  But I got emails from people that said   Oh my God  your husband is such an asshole. How much money does he spend on beer in a year  You could take that money and buy your banjo. Why don't you open a separate account   I've been with him since I was     we've never had a separate bank account. They said   Separate your bank account. Spend your money  spend his money  that's it.  And then I got people saying   Leave him.  I was like   OK  what  Who are these people  And why are they reading this   And I realized  I don't want to reach these people. I don't want to write for this public audience. And I started to kill my blog slowly. I'm like  I don't want to write this anymore. Slowly and slowly    And I did tell personal stories from time to time. I wrote this one  and I put this up because of Einstein today. I'm going to get choked up  because this is my first pet  and she passed away two years ago. And I decided to break from   I don't really write about my public life   because I wanted to give her a little memorial. But anyways  it's these sorts of personal stories    You know  you read the blogs about politics or about media  and gossip and all these things. These are out there  but it's more of the personal that interests me  and this is who I am. You see Norman Rockwell  and you have art critics say   Norman Rockwell is not art. Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms  and this is not something to be considered high art.  And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans. These things resonate with us  and  if you think about blogs  you think of high art blogs  the history paintings about  you know  all the biblical stories  and then you have this. These are the blogs that interest me  the people that just tell stories. One story is about this baby  and his name is Odin. His father was a blogger. And he was writing his blog one day  and his wife gave birth to her baby at    weeks. And he never expected this. One day  it was normal  the next day  it was hell. And this is a one pound baby. So Odin was documented every single day. Pictures were taken every day  day one  day two ... You have day nine    they're talking about his apnea  day       he gets pneumonia. His baby is so small  and I've never encountered such a    just    a disturbing image  but just so heartfelt. And you're reading this as it happens  so on day     everybody reads that he's having failures  breathing failures and heart failures  and it's slowing down  and you don't know what to expect. But then it gets better. Day     he goes home. And you see this post. That's not something you're going to see in a paper or magazine but this is something this person feels  and people are excited about it       comments. That's not a huge amount of people reading  but    people matter. And today  he is a healthy baby  who  if you read his blog    it's snowdeal.org  his father's blog    he is taking pictures of him still  because he is still his son and he is  I think  at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital. So  blogs. So what  You've probably heard these things before. We talked about the WELL  and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history. But I think blogs are basically just an evolution  and that's where we are today. It's this record of who you are  your persona. You have your Google search  where you say   What is Mena Trott   And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy. But then you also find people's blogs  and those are the records of people that are writing daily    not necessarily about the same topic  but things that interest them. And we talk about the world flattens  being in this panel  and I am very optimistic    whenever I think about blogs  I'm like   We've got to reach all these people.  Hundreds of millions and billions of people. We're getting into China  we want to be there  but there are so many people that won't have the access to write a blog. But to see something like the      computer is amazing  because blogging software is simple. We have a successful company because of timing  and because of perseverance  but it's simple stuff    it's not rocket science. And so  that's an amazing thing to consider. So    the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important. And we started with a slide of my Teds  and I had to add this slide  because I knew the minute I showed this  my mom    my mom will see this  because she does read my blog and she'll say   Why wasn't there a picture of me   This is my mom. So  I have all the people that I know of. But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line. I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before  and this one  I grew up with  looking at constantly. I would spend hours looking at the connections  saying   Oh  the little kid up at the top has red hair  so does that first generation up there.  And it's just these little things. This is not science  but this was enough for me to be really interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line. So that has always influenced me. I have this record  this      census  of another Grabowski    that's my maiden name    and there's a Theodore  because there's always a Theodore. This is all I have  a couple of facts about somebody. I have their date of birth  their age  what they did in their household  if they spoke English  and that's it  that's all I know of these people. And it's pretty sad  because I only go back five generations  and that's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side  because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things. Just doing this  I spent time in the archives    that's why my husband's a saint    I spent time in the Washington archives  just sitting there  looking for these things. Now it's online  but he sat through that. And so you have this record and    This is my great great grandmother. This is the only picture I have. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs  to think about the people that are on those      computers  talking about who they are  sharing these personal stories    this is an amazing thing. Another photo that has greatly influenced me  or a series of photos  is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife. And he's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past  what is '          ... Oh my God  I'm '         years  Twenty nine years. There was a joke  originally  about my graph that I left out  which is  You see all this math  I'm just happy I was able to add it up to      because that's my skill set. So you have these people aging  and now this is them today  or last year. And that's a powerful thing to have  to be able to track this. I wish that I would have this of my family. I know that one day my children will be wondering    or my grandchildren  or my great grandchildren  if I ever have children    what I am going to    who I was. So I do something that's very narcissistic    I am a blogger    that is an amazing thing for me  because it captures a moment in time every day. I take a picture of myself    I've been doing this since last year    every single day. And  you know  it's the same picture  it's basically the same person. Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience  I'm showing it now  but I would go insane if this was really public. About four people probably read it  and they tell me   You haven't updated.  I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated. But this is amazing  because I can go back to a day    to April       and say  what was I doing this day  I look at it  I know exactly. It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do. I put the bad pictures up too  because there are bad pictures. And I remember instantly  I am in Germany in this    I had to go for a one day trip. I was sick  and I was in a hotel room  and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things  it's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it  so I have this look. If you look at my driver's license  I have the same look  and it's a pretty disturbing thing  but it's something that is really important. And the last story I really want to tell is this story  because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing. I'll probably get choked up  because I tend to when I talk about this. So  this woman  her name was Emma  and she was a blogger on our service  TypePad. And she was a beta tester  so she was there right when we opened    you know  there was     people. And she wrote about her life dealing with cancer. She was writing and writing  and we all started reading it  because we had so few blogs on the service  we could keep track of everyone. And she was writing one day  and then she disappeared for a little bit. And her sister came on  and she said that Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional  and it was a very hard day at the company. And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship  and flattening this sort of world. That this woman is in England  and she lives    she lived    a life where she was talking about what she was doing. But the big thing that really influenced us was  her sister wrote to me  and she said    and she wrote on this blog    that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her  and being able to talk to people and to share what was going on  and being able to write and receive comments. And that was amazing  to be able to know that we had empowered that  and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing  and the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary  that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs  that we can be people who are open  and wanting to help and talk to people. That was an amazing thing. And so I printed out and sent a PDF of her blog to her family  and they passed it out at her memorial service  and even in her obituary  they mentioned her blog  because it was such a big part of her life. And that's a huge thing. So  this is her legacy  and I think that my call to action to all of you is  think about blogs  think about what they are  think about what you've thought of them  and then actually do it  because it's something that's really going to change our lives. So  thank you. You know  when Chris first approached me to speak at TED  I said no  because I felt like I wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection  you know  that I wanted to. It's such a large conference. But he explained to me that he was in a bind  and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for. So I said fine  Ted    I mean Chris. I'll come on two conditions. One  I want to speak as early in the morning as possible. And two  I want to pick the theme for TED     . And luckily he agreed. And the theme  in two years  is going to be  Cute Pictures Of Puppies.   How to Dance Properly BASIC TWIRL   NEW SCHOOL   OLD SCHOOL   WHO'S YOUR DADDY     RIDE THE PONY    MAKE LOVE TO THE CROWD   SMACKING THAT ASS   STIR THE POT OF LOVE   HANGING OUT ... CASUAL   WORD.  I invented the Placebo Camera. It doesn't actually take pictures  but it's a hell of a lot cheaper  and you still feel like you were there.  Dear Sir  good day  compliments of the day  and my best wishes to you and family. I know this letter will come to you surprisingly  but let it not be a surprise to you  for nature has a way of arriving unannounced  and  as an adage says  originals are very hard to find  but their echoes sound ouder. So I decided to contact you myself  for you to assure me of safety and honesty  if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody. I am Mr Micheal Bangura  the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone but was killed during the civil war. Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment  and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business  on which premise I write you. Before my father death  he had the sum of    million United States dollars  which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war. This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country  before the outbreak of war. When the war broke out  the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him  my father insisted it was not in his possession  and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund. Meanwhile  my mother and I is the only person who knows about it because my father always confide in me. I made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker  who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport  Freetown  although he did not know the real contents of the box. The fund was deposited as a family reasure  in a safe  reliable security company in Dakar  Senegal  where I was only given temporary asylum. I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate  and so close to my country. The only assistance I need from you  which I know you would do for me  are the following  one  be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust  two  provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted  three  receive the funds into your account in trust  take out your commission  and leave the rest of the money until I arrive  after the transfer is complete. Sincerely  Mr Micheal Bangura.  This is really embarrassing. I was told backstage that I have    minutes. I only prepared   . So if it's cool  I'd like to just wait for three. I'm really sorry. What's your name  Mark Surfas. It's pretty cool  huh  Pursuing happiness. Are you a virgin  Virgin  I mean    no  I mean like in the TED sense  Are you  Oh  yeah  So what are you  like  a thousand  two thousand  somewhere in there  Huh  Oh  You don't know what I'm talking about  Ah  Mark    Surfas.          am I good  And that's nothing to be ashamed of. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Yeah  I was hanging out with some Google guys last night. Really cool  we were getting wasted. And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that  based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime  they can actually predict what you are going to say    next. And I was like   Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy.  But they said   No  but don't show anyone.  But they slipped up. And they said that I could just type in  What was I going to say next   and my name  and it would tell me. And I have to tell you  this is an unadulterated piece of software  this is a real Internet browser and this is the actual Google site  and we're going to test it out live today. What was I going to say next  And  Ze Frank     that's me. Am I feeling lucky  Audience  Yes  Yeah  Ze Frank  Oh  Amazing. In March of         I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's  Justify My Love.  On a Thursday  I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to    of my closest friends  as part of an invitation to my    an invitation to my th    th      th birthday party. By Monday  over a million people were coming to this site a day. Within a week  I received a call from Earthlink that said  due to a    cents per megabyte overage charge  I owed them        dollars. Needless to say  I was able to leave my job.  WAS LAID OFF  And  finally  you know  become freelance.  UNEMPLOYED  But some people refer to me more as  like  an Internet guru or     JACKASS  swami. I knew I had something. I'd basically distilled a very difficult to explain and complex philosophy  which I won't get into here  because it's a little too deep for all of you  but    It's about what makes websites popular  and  you know  it's     DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING  It's unfortunate that I don't have more time. Maybe I can come back next year  or something like that. I'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it. Four years later  I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know  and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures  you know  It's like a microscope to the rest of the world. You can kind of peer into other people's lives. And I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user. For example  somebody wrote   Hey Ze  if you ever come to Boulder  you should rock out with us   and I said   Why wait    rocking out  And they said   Hey Ze  thanks for rocking out  but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked.  And that was embarrassing. But you know  it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans  so I said   Sure.   rocking out naked  I hear a lot of you whispering. And I know what you're saying   Holy crap  How is his presentation so smooth   And I have to say that it's not all me this year. I guess Chris has to take some credit here  because in years past  I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED. I don't know. And so  this year  Chris sent us a TED conference simulator. Which really allowed us as speakers to get there  in the trenches  and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience. And I've got to say that  you know  it's really  really great to be here. I'd like to tell all of you a little joke. Not just the good stuff  though. You can do heckler mode. Voice  Hey  moron  get off the stage  ZF  You get off the stage. Voice  We want Malcolm Gladwell. In case you run over time. Just one last thing I'd like to say  I'd  really    I'd like to thank all of you for being here. And frog mode.  Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes  It's true. Some people say to me   Ze  you're doing all this stuff  this Internet stuff  and you're not making any money.   Why   And I say   Mom  Dad    I'm trying.  I don't know if you're all aware of this  but the video game market  kids are playing these video games  but  supposedly  there's tons of money. I mean  like  I think          dollars or so a year is being spent on these things. So I decided to try my hand. I came up with a few games. This is called  Atheist.  I figured it would be popular with the young kids. OK. Look  I'll move around and say some things.  Game over. There is no replay.  So that didn't go over so well. I don't really understand why you're laughing. Should have done this before I tried to pitch it.  Buddhist   of course  looks very  very similar to  Atheist.  But you come back as a duck. And this is great because  you know  for a quarter  you can play this for a long time. And Chris had said in an email that we should really bring something new to TED  something that we haven't shown anyone. So  I made this for TED. It's  Christian.  It's the third in the series. I'm hoping it's going to do well this year. Do you have a preference  Good choice. So you can wait for the Second Coming  which is a random number between one and     million. So really  what are we talking about here  Oh  tech joy. Tech joy  to me  means something  because I get a lot of joy out of tech. And in fact  making things using technology    and I'm being serious here  even though I'm using my sarcastic voice    I won't    hold on. Making things  you know    making things actually does give me a lot of joy. It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life  and it's that feeling of being about    percent complete on a project    where you know you still have something to do  but it's not finished  and you're not starting something    that really fills my entire life. And so  what I've done is  I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists. We're in a culture of guru ship. It's so hard to use some software because  you know  it's unapproachable  people feel like they have to read the manual. So I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves  and  hopefully    Whoa  I'm like    on the page  but it doesn't exist. It's  like    seriously  though    I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves. Here I created a contest called   When Office Supplies Attack   which  I think  really resonated with the working population. Over     entries in three weeks. Toilet paper fashion. Again  people from all over the country. The watch is particularly incredible. Online drawing tools    you've probably seen a lot of them. I think they're wonderful. It's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff. But I'm interested in the process of creating  as the real event that I'm interested in. And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing  and they get bummed out at this  sort of  you know  stick figure  awful little thing that they created. And eventually  it just makes them stop playing with it  or they draw penises and things like that. So  the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool. In other words  it's a helping tool. You can draw your simple stick figure  and it collaborates with you to create sort of a post war German etching. In fact  it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse. So  we go ahead  and we start scribbling. So the idea is that you can really  you know  partake in this process  but watch something really crappy look beautiful. And here are some of my favorites. This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me. Very cool. Darling. Beautiful stuff. I mean this is incredible. An    year old girl drew this and submitted it. It's just gorgeous. I'm dead serious here. This is not a joke. But  I think it's a really fun and wonderful thing. So this is called the  Fiction Project.  This is an online space  which is basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing. These are haikus. None of the haikus were written by the same person. In fact  each line is contributed by a different person at a different time. I think that the  now tied up  tied down  mistress cruel approaches me  now tied down  it's up.  It's an amazing way  and I'll tell you  if you come home  and your spouse  or whoever it is  says   Let's talk     That  like  chills you to the very core. But it's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together  doing fun things. They actually get to know each other  and it's sort of like low threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking. And very  very quickly    I love puppets. Here's a puppet. It dances to music. Lotte Reiniger  an amazing shadow puppeteer in the   s  that started doing more elaborate things. I became interested in puppets  and I just want to show one last thing to you. Oh  this is how you make puppets. Chris Anderson  Ladies and gentlemen  Mr. Ze Frank. I'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century  and perhaps in the next        years. But I want to start with my work on romantic love  because that's my most recent work. What I and my colleagues did was put    people  who were madly in love  into a functional MRI brain scanner.    who were madly in love and their love was accepted  and    who were madly in love and they had just been dumped. And so I want to tell you about that first  and then go on into where I think love is going.  What 'tis to love   Shakespeare said. I think our ancestors    I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago. I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last    years of the psychological research and as it turns out  there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love. The first thing that happens is  a person begins to take on what I call   special meaning.  As a truck driver once said to me   The world had a new center  and that center was Mary Anne.  George Bernard Shaw said it differently.  Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another.  And indeed  that's what we do. And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you don't like about them  but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do. As Chaucer said   Love is blind.  In trying to understand romantic love  I decided I would read poetry from all over the world  and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth century China  because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman. It's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot    their car is different from every other car in the parking lot. Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party. And in this case  a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat. And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.  I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home  I watched you roll it out.  He became hooked on a sleeping mat  probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain  just like with you and me. But anyway  not only does this person take on special meaning  you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy. As one Polynesian said   I felt like jumping in the sky.  You're up all night. You're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation when things are going well  mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one businessman in New York said to me   Anything she liked  I liked.  Simple. Romantic love is very simple. You become extremely sexually possessive. You know  if you're just sleeping with somebody casually  you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love  you become extremely sexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian purpose to this. The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team. But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving  an intense craving to be with a particular person  not just sexually  but emotionally. It would be nice to go to bed with them  but you want them to call you on the telephone  to invite you out  etc.  to tell you that they love you. The other main characteristic is motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank  and you want this person. And last but not least  it is an obsession. Before I put these people in the MRI machine  I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most important question was always the same. It was   What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person   And indeed  they would say   All day. All night. I can never stop thinking about him or her.  And then  the very last question    I would always have to work myself up to this question  because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say   Would you die for him or her   And  indeed  these people would say  Yes   as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it. So we scanned their brains  looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph  with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity in a lot of brain regions. In fact  one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed  that's exactly what happens. I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion. In fact  I had always thought it was a series of emotions  from very high to very low. But actually  it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind  the wanting part of the mind  the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate  when you want to win that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive. And in fact  I think it's more powerful than the sex drive. You know  if you ask somebody to go to bed with you  and they say   No  thank you   you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly  around the world  people who are rejected in love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs  poems  novels  sculptures  paintings  myths  legends. In over     societies  people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. And I've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive  the craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it an  intolerable neural itch   and indeed  that's what it is. It keeps bothering you a little bit  like being hungry. The second of these three brain systems is romantic love  that elation  obsession of early love. And the third brain system is attachment  that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long term partner. And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there  looking for a whole range of partners. You can feel it when you're just driving along in your car. It can be focused on nobody. I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time  thereby conserving mating time and energy. And I think that attachment  the third brain system  evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being at least long enough to raise a child together as a team. So with that preamble  I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends. One of the last        years and the other  certainly of the last    years  that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems  lust  romantic love and deep attachment to a partner. The first is women working  moving into the workforce. I've looked at     societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations. Everywhere in the world      out of     of them  women are not only moving into the job market    sometimes very  very slowly  but they are moving into the job market    and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power  health and education. It's very slow. For every trend on this planet  there's a counter trend. We all know of them  but nevertheless    the Arabs say   The dogs may bark  but the caravan moves on.  And  indeed  that caravan is moving on. Women are moving back into the job market. And I say back into the job market  because this is not new. For millions of years  on the grasslands of Africa  women commuted to work to gather their vegetables. They came home with    to    percent of the evening meal. The double income family was the standard. And women were regarded as just as economically  socially and sexually powerful as men. In short  we're really moving forward to the past. Then  women's worst invention was the plow. With the beginning of plow agriculture  men's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors  but then with the industrial revolution and the post industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. In short  they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago         years ago          years ago. We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal. And it's going to have an impact. I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community. I'll say just a couple of things  and then go on to sex and love. There's a lot of gender differences  anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child. I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike. There's much we have in common  but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common. We are    in the words of Ted Hughes   I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead.  But we did not evolve to have the same brain. And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain. I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love. One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk. Women's ability to find the right word rapidly  basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle  when estrogen levels peak. But even at menstruation  they're better than the average man. Women can talk. They've been doing it for a million years  words were women's tools. They held that baby in front of their face  cajoling it  reprimanding it  educating it with words. And  indeed  they're becoming a very powerful force. Even in places like India and Japan  where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market  they're moving into journalism. And I think that the television is like the global campfire. We sit around it and it shapes our minds. Almost always  when I'm on TV  the producer who calls me  who negotiates what we're going to say  is a woman. In fact  Solzhenitsyn once said   To have a great writer is to have another government.  Today    percent of people who are writers in America are women. It's one of many  many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market. They've got incredible people skills  negotiating skills. They're highly imaginative. We now know the brain circuitry of imagination  of long term planning. They tend to be web thinkers. Because the female parts of the brain are better connected  they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think  put them into more complex patterns  see more options and outcomes. They tend to be contextual  holistic thinkers  what I call web thinkers. Men tend to    and these are averages    tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous  focus on what they do  and move in a more step by step thinking pattern. They're both perfectly good ways of thinking. We need both of them to get ahead. In fact  there's many more male geniuses in the world. And there's also many more male idiots in the world. When the male brain works well  it works extremely well. And what I really think that we're doing is  we're moving towards a collaborative society  a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed. But in fact  women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life. Foremost  women are starting to express their sexuality. I'm always astonished when people come to me and say   Why is it that men are so adulterous    Why do you think more men are adulterous than women    Well  men are more adulterous   And I say   Who do you think these men are sleeping with   And    basic math  Anyway. In the Western world  women start sooner at sex  have more partners  express less remorse for the partners that they do  marry later  have fewer children  leave bad marriages in order to get good ones. We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression. And  indeed  once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago  because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today. We're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality. They're now saying that the   st century is going to be the century of what they call the  symmetrical marriage   or the  pure marriage   or the  companionate marriage.  This is a marriage between equals  moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit. We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.    percent of American women and    percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner  if they were not in love with that person. People around the world  in a study of    societies  want to be in love with the person that they marry. Indeed  arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life. I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend. The first one being women moving into the job market  the second one being the aging world population. They're now saying that in America  that middle age should be regarded as up to age   . Because in that highest age category of    to     as much as    percent of people have nothing really wrong with them. So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age. For one of my books  I looked at divorce data in    societies. And as it turns out  the older you get  the less likely you are to divorce. So the divorce rate right now is stable in America  and it's actually beginning to decline. It may decline some more. I would even say that with Viagra  estrogen replacement  hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women    women have never been as interesting as they are now. Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated  so interesting  so capable. And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages  that time is now. However  there's always kinds of complications in this. These three brain systems    lust  romantic love and attachment    don't always go together. They can go together  by the way. That's why casual sex isn't so casual. With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine. Dopamine's associated with romantic love  and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. With orgasm  then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin    those are associated with attachment. This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them. But these three brain systems  lust  romantic love and attachment  aren't always connected to each other. You can feel deep attachment to a long term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else  while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners. In short  we're capable of loving more than one person at a time. In fact  you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else. It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do. So I don't think  honestly  we're an animal that was built to be happy  we are an animal that was built to reproduce. I think the happiness we find  we make. And I think  however  we can make good relationships with each other. So I want to conclude with two things. I want to conclude with a worry  and with a wonderful story. The worry is about antidepressants. Over     million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States. And these drugs are going generic. They are seeping around the world. I know one girl who's been on these antidepressants  SSRIs  serotonin enhancing antidepressants    since she was   . She's   . She's been on them ever since she was   . I've got nothing against people who take them short term  when they're going through something horrible. They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else. I would recommend it. But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term. And indeed  what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin. And by raising levels of serotonin  you suppress the dopamine circuit. Everybody knows that. Dopamine is associated with romantic love. Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit  but they kill the sex drive. And when you kill the sex drive  you kill orgasm. And when you kill orgasm  you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment. The things are connected in the brain. And when you tamper with one brain system  you're going to tamper with another. I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place. So now    Thank you. I want to end with a story. And then  just a comment. I've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for    years. I'm an identical twin  I am interested in why we're all alike. Why you and I are alike  why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike. And about a year ago  an Internet dating service  Match.com  came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them. I said   I don't know anything about personality. You know  I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person   They said   Yes.  It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another. That's my current project  it will be my next book. There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another. Timing is important. Proximity is important. Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious  in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain  probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love. You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your  love map   an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up. And I also think that you gravitate to certain people  actually  with somewhat complementary brain systems. And that's what I'm now contributing to this. But I want to tell you a story  to illustrate. I've been carrying on here about the biology of love. I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it  too  the magic of it. It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one    probably a true story. It was a graduate student    I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues    Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook. That's where we put our people in the MRI machine. And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student  and she was not in love with him. And they were all at a conference in Beijing. And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody  you can drive up the dopamine in the brain  and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love. So he decided he'd put science to work. And he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him. And sure enough    I've never been in one  but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting. He figured that this would drive up the dopamine  and she'd fall in love with him. So off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time. An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw  and she throws her hands up and she says   Wasn't that wonderful   And   Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome   There's magic to love  But I will end by saying that millions of years ago  we evolved three basic drives  the sex drive  romantic love and attachment to a long term partner. These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain. They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called  this mortal coil.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Helen Fisher  I bet you're worried. I was worried. That's why I began this piece. I was worried about vaginas. I was worried what we think about vaginas and even more worried that we don't think about them. I was worried about my own vagina. It needed a context  a culture  a community of other vaginas. There is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them. Like the Bermuda Triangle  nobody ever reports back from there. In the first place  it's not so easy to even find your vagina. Women go days  weeks  months  without looking at it. I interviewed a high powered businesswoman  she told me she didn't have time.  Looking at your vagina   she said   is a full day's work.   You've got to get down there on your back  in front of a mirror  full length preferred. You've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light  which then becomes shadowed by the angle you're at. You're twisting your head up  arching your back  it's exhausting.  She was busy  she didn't have time. So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas. They began as casual vagina interviews  and they turned into vagina monologues. I talked with over     women. I talked to older women  younger women  married women  lesbians  single women. I talked to corporate professionals  college professors  actors  sex workers. I talked to African American women  Asian American women  Native American women  Caucasian women  Jewish women. OK  at first women were a little shy  a little reluctant to talk. Once they got going  you couldn't stop them. Women love to talk about their vaginas  they do. Mainly because no one's ever asked them before. Let's just start with the word  vagina     vagina  vagina. It sounds like an infection  at best. Maybe a medical instrument.  Hurry  nurse  bring the vagina   Vagina  vagina  vagina. It doesn't matter how many times you say the word  it never sounds like a word you want to say. It's a completely ridiculous  totally un sexy word. If you use it during sex  trying to be politically correct   Darling  would you stroke my vagina   you kill the act right there. I'm worried what we call them and don't call them. In Great Neck  New York  they call it a Pussycat. A woman told me there her mother used to tell her   Don't wear panties  dear  underneath your pajamas. You need to air out your Pussycat.  In Westchester  they call it a Pooki  in New Jersey  a twat. There's Powderbox  derriere  a Pooky  a Poochi  a Poopi  a Poopelu  a Pooninana  a Padepachetchki  a Pal  and a Piche. There's Toadie  Dee Dee  Nishi  Dignity  Coochi Snorcher  Cooter  Labbe  Gladys Seagelman  VA  Wee wee  Horsespot  Nappy Dugout  Mongo  Ghoulie  Powderbox  a Mimi in Miami  a Split Knish in Philadelphia ... and a Schmende in the Bronx. I am worried about vaginas. This is how the  Vagina Monologues  begins. But it really didn't begin there. It began with a conversation with a woman. We were having a conversation about menopause  and we got onto the subject of her vagina  which you'll do if you're talking about menopause. And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina    that it was dried up and finished and dead    and I was kind of shocked. So I said to a friend casually   Well  what do you think about your vagina   And that woman said something more amazing  and then the next woman said something more amazing  and before I knew it  every woman was telling me I had to talk to somebody about their vagina because they had an amazing story  and I was sucked down the vagina trail. And I really haven't gotten off of it. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up  and be in shoe stores  and people would scream out   There she is  the Vagina Lady   I don't know that that would have been my life ambition. But I want to talk a little bit about happiness  and the relationship to this whole vagina journey  because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago. I think before I did the  Vagina Monologues   I didn't really believe in happiness. I thought that only idiots were happy  to be honest. I remember when I started practicing Buddhism    years ago  and I was told that the end of this practice was to be happy  I said   How could you be happy and live in this world of suffering and live in this world of pain   I mistook happiness for a lot of other things  like numbness or decadence or selfishness. And what happened through the course of the  Vagina Monologues  and this journey is  I think I have come to understand a little bit more about happiness. There are three qualities I want to talk about. One is seeing what's right in front of you  and talking about it  and stating it. I think what I learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina  is it was the most obvious thing    it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world    and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about. The second thing is that what talking about the vagina did is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better. And that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from. And the third principle of happiness  which I've realized recently  Eight years ago  this momentum and this energy  this  V wave  started    and I can only describe it as a  V wave  because  to be honest  I really don't understand it completely  I feel at the service of it. But this wave started  and if I question the wave  or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave  I often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking. But if I go with the wave  and I trust the wave and I move with the wave  I go to the next place  and it happens logically and organically and truthfully. And I started this piece  particularly with stories and narratives  and I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman. And then I wrote those stories down  and I put them out in front of other people. And every single time I did the show at the beginning  women would literally line up after the show  because they wanted to tell me their stories. And at first I thought   Oh great  I'll hear about wonderful orgasms  and great sex lives  and how women love their vaginas.  But in fact  that's not what women lined up to tell me. What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped  and how they were battered  and how they were beaten  and how they were gang raped in parking lots  and how they were incested by their uncles. And I wanted to stop doing the  Vagina Monologues   because it felt too daunting. I felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events  but doesn't intervene on their behalf. And so in       I said   Let's get women together. What could we do with this information that all these women are being violated   And it turned out  after thinking and investigating  that I discovered    and the UN has actually said this recently    that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime. That's essentially a gender  that's essentially the resource of the planet  which is women. So in      we got all these incredible women together and we said   How can we use the play  this energy  to stop violence against women   And we put on one event in New York City  in the theater  and all these great actors came    from Susan Sarandon  to Glenn Close  to Whoopi Goldberg    and we did one performance on one evening  and that catalyzed this wave  this energy. And within five years  this extraordinary thing began to happen. One woman took that energy and she said   I want to bring this wave  this energy  to college campuses   and so she took the play and she said   Let's use the play and have performances once a year  where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world.  And in one year  it went to    colleges  and then it expanded. And over the course of the last six years  it's spread and it's spread and it's spread around the world. What I have learned is two things  one  that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking  it's global  it is so profound and it is so devastating  and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater  of every little society that we don't even recognize it  because it's become ordinary. This journey has taken me to Afghanistan  where I had the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban. I was dressed in a burqa and I went in with an extraordinary group  called the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. And I saw firsthand how women had been stripped of every single right that was possible to strip women of    from being educated  to being employed  to being actually allowed to eat ice cream. For those of you who don't know  it was illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban. And I actually saw and met women who had been flogged for being caught eating vanilla ice cream. I was taken to the secret ice cream eating place in a little town  where we went to a back room  and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us  and they were served vanilla ice cream. And women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream. And I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment  and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive. It has taken me  this journey  to Islamabad  where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off. It has taken me to Juarez  Mexico  where I was a week ago  where I have literally been there in parking lots  where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to Coca Cola bottles. It has taken me to universities all over this country  where girls are date raped and drugged. I have seen terrible  terrible  terrible violence. But I have also recognized  in the course of seeing that violence  that being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us is the antidote to depression  and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value. Because before the  Vagina Monologues   I will say that    percent of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on in this reality  and that closing off closed off my vitality and my life energy. What has also happened is in the course of these travels    and it's been an extraordinary thing    is that every single place that I have gone to in the world  I have met a new species. And I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea. And I was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel  that it's beneath  beyond and between  and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories. But one of the things I've seen is this species    and it is a species  and it is a new paradigm  and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media because I don't think good news ever is news  and I don't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on TV shows. But every single country I have been to    and in the last six years  I've been to about    countries  and many tiny little villages and cities and towns    I have seen something what I've come to call  vagina warriors.  A  vagina warrior  is a woman  or a vagina friendly man  who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it  and rather than getting an AK    or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete  they hold the violence in their bodies  they grieve it  they experience it  and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else. I have met these women everywhere on the planet  and I want to tell a few stories  because I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information  where it goes into our bodies. And I think one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting is that I live in my body a lot  and I don't live in my head very much anymore. And this is a very heady place. And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days  I've been very disoriented    because I think the world  the V world  is very much in your body. It's a body world  and the species really exists in the body. And I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads  that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose from intent. And the connection between body and head often brings those things into union. I want to talk about three particular people that I've met  vagina warriors  who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species  and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez. Marsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala. She was    years old  and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis. And she couldn't get out  because she was addicted to the relationship  and she had no money. Her sister was younger than her  and she applied    we had a  Stop Rape  contest a few years ago in New York    and she applied  hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister. She did become a finalist  she brought Marsha to New York. And at that time  we did this extraordinary V Day at Madison Square Garden  where we sold out the entire testosterone filled dome           people standing up to say  Yes  to vaginas  which was really a pretty incredible transformation. And she came  and she witnessed this  and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband  and that she would bring V Day to Guatemala. She was    years old. I went to Guatemala and she had sold out the National Theater of Guatemala. And I watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress and high heels  and she stood there and said   My name is Marsha. I was beaten by my husband for five years. He almost murdered me. I left and you can  too.  And the entire       people went absolutely crazy. There's a woman named Esther Ch vez who I met in Juarez  Mexico. And Esther Ch vez was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City. She was    years old and she was planning to retire. She went to Juarez to take care of an ailing aunt  and in the course of it  she began to discover what was happening to the murdered and disappeared women of Juarez. She gave up her life  she moved to Juarez. She started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women.     women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor. There has been no response to the disappearance  and not one person has been held accountable. She began to document it. She opened a center called Casa Amiga  and in six years  she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world. We were there a week ago  when there were       people in the street  and it was truly a miracle. And as we walked through the streets  the people of Juarez  who normally don't even come into the streets  because the streets are so dangerous  literally stood there and wept  to see that other people from the world had showed up for that particular community. There's another woman  named Agnes. And Agnes  for me  epitomizes what a vagina warrior is. I met her three years ago in Kenya. And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl  she was circumcised against her will when she was    years old  and she really made a decision that she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community. So when she got older  she created this incredible thing  it's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body  half a woman's body. And she walked through the Rift Valley  and she had vagina and vagina replacement parts  where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like  and what a mutilated vagina looks like. And in the course of her travel    she walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley  through dust  through sleeping on the ground  because the Maasai are nomads  and she would have to find them  and they would move  and she would find them again    she saved       girls from being cut. And in that time  she created an alternative ritual  which involved girls coming of age without the cut. When we met her three years ago  we said   What could V Day do for you   And she said   Well  if you got me a jeep  I could get around a lot faster.  So we bought her a jeep. And in the year that she had the jeep  she saved       girls from being cut. So we said to her   What else could we do for you   She said   Well  Eve  if you gave me some money  I could open a house and girls could run away  and they could be saved.  And I want to tell this little story about my own beginnings  because it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes. When I was a little girl    I grew up in a wealthy community  it was an upper middle class white community  and it had all the trappings and the looks of a perfectly nice  wonderful  great life. And everyone was supposed to be happy in that community  and  in fact  my life was hell. I lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me  and it was all inside that. And always as a child I had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me. And I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr. Alligator. I would call him up when things got really bad  and say it was time to come and pick me up. And I would pack a little bag and wait for Mr. Alligator to come. Now  Mr. Alligator never did come  but the idea of Mr. Alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it OK for me to keep going  because I believed  in the distance  there would be someone coming to rescue me. Cut to    some odd years later  we go to Kenya  and we're walking  we arrive at the opening of this house. And Agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days  because they were preparing this whole ritual. I want to tell you a great story. When Agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation in her community  she had become an outcast  and she was exiled and slandered  and the whole community turned against her. But being a vagina warrior  she kept going  and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness. And in the Maasai community  goats and cows are the most valued possession. They're like the Mercedes Benz of the Rift Valley. And she said two days before the house opened  two different people arrived to give her a goat each  and she said to me   I knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa.  Anyway  we arrived  and when we arrived  there were hundreds of girls dressed in red homemade dresses    which is the color of the Maasai and the color of V Day    and they greeted us. They had made up these songs that they were singing  about the end of suffering and the end of mutilation  and they walked us down the path. It was a gorgeous day in the African sun  and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing  and there was this house  and it said   V Day Safe House for the Girls.  And it hit me in that moment that it had taken    years  but that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up. And he had shown up  obviously  in a form that it took me a long time to understand  which is that when we give in the world what we want the most  we heal the broken part inside each of us. And I feel  in the last eight years  that this journey    this miraculous vagina journey    has taught me this really simple thing  which is that happiness exists in action  it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is  and it exists in giving away what you want the most. And I feel that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege  and I feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you. Thank you very much. We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising. So I'll try and do that  but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows. And the first one  in fact  is something that has been known for most of recorded history  and that is  that the planet Earth  or the solar system  or our environment or whatever  is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution    or creation  as it used to be thought    and our present existence  and most important  our future survival. Nowadays  this idea has a dramatic name  Spaceship Earth. And the idea there is that outside the spaceship  the universe is implacably hostile  and inside is all we have  all we depend on  and we only get the one chance  if we mess up our spaceship  we've got nowhere else to go. Now  the second thing that everyone already knows is that  contrary to what was believed for most of human history  human beings are not  in fact  the hub of existence. As Stephen Hawking famously said  we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star  which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy  and so on. Now  the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very un typical place  uniquely suited and so on  and the second one is saying that we're at a typical place. And  especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions  then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other. But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false. And they are. So let me start with the second one   Typical.  Well  is this a typical place  Well  let's look around  you know  look in a random direction  and we see a wall  and chemical scum    and that's not typical of the universe at all. All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back  and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all    all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that  you'll see the Sun  the solar system and the stars and so on  but that's still not typical of the universe  because stars come in galaxies. And most places in the universe  a typical place in the universe  is nowhere near any galaxies. So let's go out further  till we're outside the galaxy  and look back  and yeah  there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us. And at this point  we've come         light years from here. But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe. To get to a typical place  you've got to go       times as far as that  into intergalactic space. And so  what does that look like     typical   What does a  typical  place in the universe look like  Well  at enormous expense  TED has arranged a high resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space. Can we have the lights off  please  so we can see it  Well  not quite  not quite perfect. You see  intergalactic space is completely dark  pitch dark. It's so dark  that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you  and that star were to explode as a supernova  and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you  you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer. That's how big and how dark the universe is. And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright  so brilliant an event  that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years. And yet  from intergalactic space  it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. It's also very cold out there    less than three degrees above absolute zero. And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create. So that's how different a typical place is from this place. And that is how un typical this place is. So can we have the lights back on please  Thank you. Now  how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to  Well  the Earth    our environment  in the form of us    is creating knowledge. Well  what does that mean  Well  look out even further than we've just been    I mean from here  with a telescope    and you'll see things that look like stars  they're called quasars.  Quasars  originally meant  quasi stellar object   which means  things that look a bit like stars.  But they're not stars. And we know what they are. Billions of years ago and billions of light years away  the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super massive black hole. And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets  which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of    I think it's a trillion    suns. Now  the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet. We couldn't survive for an instant in it. Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets. It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion  but at point blank range and for millions of years at a time. And yet  that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later  on the other side of the universe  some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain  above all    there's your reference    what was happening there  in reality. The one physical system  the brain  contains an accurate working model of the other  the quasar. Not just a superficial image of it  though it contains that as well  but an explanatory model  embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure. Now  that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough  the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge. So  the laws of physics have this special property  that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be  can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time. So we are a chemical scum that is different. This chemical scum has universality. Its structure contains  with ever increasing precision  the structure of everything. This place  and not other places in the universe  is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality. And so  far from being insignificant  the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen  is one of the most important things about the physical world. Now how does the solar system    our environment  in the form of us    acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe  Well  one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark    I mean  it is true  but it's the wrong emphasis. One thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics  there's no special dispensation  no miracles involved. It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance. One of them is matter  because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing. Information processing is computation  computation requires a computer    there's no known way of making a computer without matter. We also need energy to make the computer  and most important  to make the media  in effect  onto which we record the knowledge that we discover. And then thirdly  less tangible but just as essential for the open ended creation of knowledge  of explanations  is evidence. Now  our environment is inundated with evidence. We happen to get round to testing  let's say  Newton's Law of Gravity  about     years ago. But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that  and will continue to fall for billions of years afterwards. And the same is true for all the other sciences. As far as we know  evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking  on our planet. Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy. Out in intergalactic space  those three prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply    as I said  it's empty  it's cold and it's dark out there. Or is it  Now actually  that's just another parochial misconception. Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space  the same size as our home  the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards  but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter. And a million tons is enough to make  say  a self contained space station  on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open ended stream of knowledge  and so on. Now  it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on. But the thing is  in a comprehensible universe  if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics  then what could possibly prevent us from doing it  other than knowing how  In other words  it's a matter of knowledge  not resources. If we could do that  we'd automatically have an energy supply  because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor. And evidence  Well  again  it's dark out there to human senses  but all you've got to do is take a telescope  even one of present day design  look out  and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here. And with a more powerful telescope  you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies  you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics. And locally there you could build particle accelerators  and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry  and so on. Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips    because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life bearing planet and back. But I have to tell you    and sorry  Richard    but I never did like biology field trips much  and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years. So in fact  intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open ended creation of knowledge. Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are  if the knowledge of how to do so were present there. So  we're not in a uniquely hospitable place. If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open ended stream of explanations  then so is almost every other environment  so is the Earth. So is a polluted Earth. And the limiting factor  there and here  is not resources  because they're plentiful  but knowledge  which is scarce. Now this cosmic knowledge based view may    and I think ought to    make us feel very special. But it should also make us feel vulnerable  because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe  we won't survive them. All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away  and we'll all be dead  Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things  from astrophysics  to scientific experiments gone wrong  and most importantly  to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction. And he thinks that civilization has only a    percent chance of surviving this century. I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference. Now  I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in  but I do agree with him about this  We can survive and we can fail to survive. But it depends not on chance  but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time. The danger is not at all unprecedented. Species go extinct all the time. Civilizations end. The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history. And if we want to be the exception to that  then logically  our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others    namely  our special relationship with the laws of physics  our ability to create new explanations  new knowledge    to be a hub of existence. So let me now apply this to a current controversy  not because I want to advocate any particular solution  but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean. And the controversy is global warming. Now  I'm a physicist  but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming  I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory. And according to that theory  it's already too late to avoid a disaster  because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO  emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol  with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars  or whatever it is  then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure. And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem  merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it  and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger. It was probably already too late in the     s  when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age  in which billions would die. Now  the lesson of that seems clear to me  and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate. It is that we can't always know. When we know of an impending disaster  and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself  then there's not going to be much argument  really. But no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee. Hence  we need a stance of problem fixing  not just problem avoidance. And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure  but that's only if we know what to prevent. If you've been punched on the nose  then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches. If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only  then it would achieve very little of either. The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs. It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature  and with plans to live at the higher temperature    and not at all costs  but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist  things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away  and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide. At the moment  these things are fringe research  they're not central to the human effort to face this problem  or problems in general. And with problems that we are not aware of yet  the ability to put right    not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely    is our only hope  not just of solving problems  but of survival. So take two stone tablets  and carve on them. On one of them  carve   Problems are soluble.  And on the other one  carve   Problems are inevitable.  Thank you. My title   Queerer than we can suppose  the strangeness of science.   Queerer than we can suppose  comes from J.B.S. Haldane  the famous biologist  who said   Now  my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose  but queerer than we can suppose. I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of  or can be dreamed of  in any philosophy.  Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories    experimental predictions    to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy. This means that quantum theory has got to be  in some sense  true. Yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even Feynman himself was moved to remark   If you think you understand quantum theory  you don't understand quantum theory.  It's so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it. David Deutsch  who's talking here  in  The Fabric of Reality   embraces the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory  because the worst that you can say about it is that it's preposterously wasteful. It postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel  mutually undetectable  except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments. And that's Richard Feynman. The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example. Science  as opposed to technology  does violence to common sense. Every time you drink a glass of water  he points out  the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell. It's just elementary probability theory. The number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls  or bladdersful  in the world. And of course  there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders    you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree.  Queerer than we can suppose.  What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything  and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose  Are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp  but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence  Are there things about the universe that are  in principle  ungraspable by any mind  however superior  The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms  as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe. We're now so used to the idea that the Earth spins  rather than the Sun moves across the sky  it's hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must have been. After all  it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless  the Sun  small and mobile. But it's worth recalling Wittgenstein's remark on the subject   Tell me   he asked a friend   why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the Sun went 'round the Earth  rather than that the Earth was rotating   And his friend replied   Well  obviously  because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth.  Wittgenstein replied   Well  what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating   Science has taught us  against all intuition  that apparently solid things  like crystals and rocks  are really almost entirely composed of empty space. And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium  and the next atom is in the next sports stadium. So it would seem the hardest  solidest  densest rock is really almost entirely empty space  broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn't count. Why  then  do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable  As an evolutionary biologist  I'd say this  our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude  of size and speed which our bodies operate at. We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms. If we had  our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space. Rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands  precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other. It's therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like  solidity  and  impenetrability   because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle sized world in which we have to navigate. Moving to the other end of the scale  our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light. If they had  our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein. I want to give the name  Middle World  to the medium scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act    nothing to do with  Middle Earth     Middle World. We are evolved denizens of Middle World  and that limits what we are capable of imagining. We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like  when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move  and hits another Middle World object like a rock  it knocks itself out. May I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III  commander of military intelligence in     .  ... He  stared at his wall in Arlington  Virginia  and decided to do it. As frightening as the prospect was  he was going into the next office. He stood up and moved out from behind his desk. 'What is the atom mostly made of ' he thought  'Space.' He started walking. 'What am I mostly made of  Atoms.' He quickened his pace  almost to a jog now. 'What is the wall mostly made of ' 'Atoms ' All I have to do is merge the spaces. Then  General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office. Stubblebine  who commanded        soldiers  was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall. He has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal. Who would screw around with an army that could do that   That's from an article in Playboy  which I was reading the other day. I have every reason to think it's true  I was reading Playboy because I  myself  had an article in it. Unaided human intuition  schooled in Middle World  finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object  air friction aside  would hit the ground at the same instant. And that's because in Middle World  air friction is always there. If we'd evolved in a vacuum  we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously. If we were bacteria  constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules  it would be different. But we Middle Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion. In the same way  our lives are dominated by gravity  but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension. A small insect would reverse these priorities. Steve Grand    he's the one on the left  Douglas Adams is on the right. Steve Grand  in his book   Creation  Life and How to Make It   is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself. We have this tendency to think that only solid  material things are really things at all. Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal. Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium  the ether. But we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in Middle World  where matter is a useful fiction. A whirlpool  for Steve Grand  is a thing with just as much reality as a rock. In a desert plain in Tanzania  in the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai  there's a dune made of volcanic ash. The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily. It's what's technically known as a  barchan   and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about    meters per year. It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns. What happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope on the other side  and then  as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge  it cascades down on the inside of the crescent  and so the whole horn shaped dune moves. Steve Grand points out that you and I are  ourselves  more like a wave than a permanent thing. He invites us  the reader  to think of an experience from your childhood  something you remember clearly  something you can see  feel  maybe even smell  as if you were really there. After all  you really were there at the time  weren't you  How else would you remember it  But here is the bombshell  You weren't there. Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place. Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. Whatever you are  therefore  you are not the stuff of which you are made. If that doesn't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck  read it again until it does  because it is important. So  really  isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence. If a neutrino had a brain  which it evolved in neutrino sized ancestors  it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space. We have brains that evolved in medium sized ancestors which couldn't walk through rocks.  Really   for an animal  is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival. And because different species live in different worlds  there will be a discomforting variety of  reallys.  What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world  but a model of the world  regulated and adjusted by sense data  but constructed so it's useful for dealing with the real world. The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are. A flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking  climbing or swimming animal. A monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating a three dimensional world of branches and trunks. A mole's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use. A water strider's brain doesn't need  D software at all  since it lives on the surface of the pond  in an Edwin Abbott flatland. I've speculated that bats may see color with their ears. The world model that a bat needs in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird    a day flying bird like a swallow    needs to perform the same kind of tasks. The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model  while the swallow uses light  is incidental. Bats  I've even suggested  use perceived hues  such as red and blue  as labels  internal labels  for some useful aspect of echoes    perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces  furry or smooth and so on    in the same way as swallows or indeed  we  use those perceived hues    redness and blueness  etc.    to label long and short wavelengths of light. There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength. The point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used  rather than by the sensory modality involved. J.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell. Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids  extremely diluted  caprylic acid and caproic acid. The only difference  you see  is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain. Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells  just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes. Now  there's another fatty acid  capric acid  which is just like the other two  except that it has two more carbon atoms. A dog that had never met capric acid would  perhaps  have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet  say  playing one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before. Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell oriented animals smell in color. And the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats. Middle World    the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with    is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors. We're blind to all frequencies outside that  unless we use instruments to help us. Middle World is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal  as opposed to the queerness of the very small  the very large and the very fast. We could make a similar scale of improbabilities  nothing is totally impossible. Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable. A marble statue could wave its hand at us  the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway. Because there are so many of them  and because there's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement  the marble  as we see it in Middle World  stays rock steady. But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time  and again and again. In this case  the hand would move  and we'd see it waving at us in Middle World. The odds against it  of course  are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe  you still would not have written enough zeros to this day. Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle very improbable events  we don't live long enough. In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time  that which seems impossible in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable. One way to think about that is by counting planets. We don't know how many planets there are in the universe  but a good estimate is about    to the     or     billion billion. And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability. We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability  which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at. If life has arisen only once on any    life could originate once per planet  could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe  in which case it would have to be here. And somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince  and similar magical things like that. If life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe  that planet has to be our planet  because here we are talking about it. And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it  we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in     billion billion. I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that  because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe. And when I say quite common  it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another  which is a sad thought. How shall we interpret  queerer than we can suppose   Queerer than can in principle be supposed  or just queerer than we can suppose  given the limitations of our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World  Could we  by training and practice  emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large  I genuinely don't know the answer. I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand  say  quantum theory  if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood  which had a make believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen  a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer's make believe  so that they became familiar on the Middle World scale of the stream. And similarly  a relativistic computer game  in which objects on the screen manifest the Lorentz contraction  and so on  to try to get ourselves    to get children into the way of thinking about it. I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World to our perceptions of each other. Most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind  we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are  our hormones are the way they are. We'd be different  our characters would be different  if our neuro anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different. But we scientists are inconsistent. If we were consistent  our response to a misbehaving person  like a child murderer  should be something like  this unit has a faulty component  it needs repairing. That's not what we say. What we say    and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us  which is probably me    what we say is   Vile monster  prison is too good for you.  Or worse  we seek revenge  in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter revenge  which we see  of course  all over the world today. In short  when we're thinking like academics  we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines  like computers or cars. But when we revert to being human  we behave more like Basil Fawlty  who  we remember  thrashed his car to teach it a lesson  when it wouldn't start on  Gourmet Night.  The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension dominated flatland  we live in a social world. We swim through a sea of people    a social version of Middle World. We are evolved to second guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant  intuitive psychologists. Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate  but it's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next. The economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful  goal seeking agent with pleasures and pains  desires and intentions  guilt  blame worthiness. Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans  it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate  like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people  with the universe as a whole. If the universe is queerer than we can suppose  is it just because we've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa  Or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution  Or finally  are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy of beings  however godlike  could dream them  Thank you very much. I think I was supposed to talk about my new book  which is called  Blink   and it's about snap judgments and first impressions. And it comes out in January  and I hope you all buy it in triplicate. But I was thinking about this  and I realized that although my new book makes me happy  and I think would make my mother happy  it's not really about happiness. So I decided instead  I would talk about someone who I think has done as much to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last    years  a man who is a great personal hero of mine  someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz  who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce. Howard's about this high  and he's round  and he's in his   s  and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair  and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality  and he has a parrot  and he loves the opera  and he's a great aficionado of medieval history. And by profession  he's a psychophysicist. Now  I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is  although at some point in my life  I dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics. Which should tell you something about that relationship. As far as I know  psychophysics is about measuring things. And Howard is very interested in measuring things. And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard  and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains  New York. And one of his first clients was Pepsi. This is many years ago  back in the early   s. And Pepsi came to Howard and they said   You know  there's this new thing called aspartame  and we would like to make Diet Pepsi. We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink.  Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer  and that's what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him   We're working with a band between eight and    percent. Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough  anything above    percent sweetness is too sweet. We want to know  what's the sweet spot between   and      Now  if I gave you this problem to do  you would all say  it's very simple. What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi  at every degree of sweetness    eight percent   .    .    .   all the way up to       and we try this out with thousands of people  and we plot the results on a curve  and we take the most popular concentration  right  Really simple. Howard does the experiment  and he gets the data back  and he plots it on a curve  and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve. In fact  the data doesn't make any sense. It's a mess. It's all over the place. Now  most people in that business  in the world of testing food and such  are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess. They think   Well  you know  figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy.   You know  maybe we made an error somewhere along the way.   You know  let's just make an educated guess   and they simply point and they go for    percent  right in the middle. Howard is not so easily placated. Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards. And this was not good enough for him  and this question bedeviled him for years. And he would think it through and say   What was wrong  Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi   And one day  he was sitting in a diner in White Plains  about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescaf . And suddenly  like a bolt of lightning  the answer came to him. And that is  that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data  they were asking the wrong question. They were looking for the perfect Pepsi  and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis. Trust me. This was an enormous revelation. This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science. Howard immediately went on the road  and he would go to conferences around the country  and he would stand up and say   You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi. You're wrong. You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis.  And people would look at him blankly and say   What are you talking about  Craziness.  And they would say   Move  Next   Tried to get business  nobody would hire him    he was obsessed  though  and he talked about it and talked about it. Howard loves the Yiddish expression  To a worm in horseradish  the world is horseradish.  This was his horseradish. He was obsessed with it  And finally  he had a breakthrough. Vlasic Pickles came to him  and they said   Doctor Moskowitz  we want to make the perfect pickle.  And he said   There is no perfect pickle  there are only perfect pickles.  And he came back to them and he said   You don't just need to improve your regular  you need to create zesty.  And that's where we got zesty pickles. Then the next person came to him  Campbell's Soup. And this was even more important. In fact  Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation. Campbell's made Prego  and Prego  in the early   s  was struggling next to Rag   which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the   s and   s. In the industry    I don't know whether you care about this  or how much time I have to go into this. But it was  technically speaking    this is an aside    Prego is a better tomato sauce than Rag . The quality of the tomato paste is much better  the spice mix is far superior  it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way. In fact  they would do the famous bowl test back in the   s with Rag  and Prego. You'd have a plate of spaghetti  and you would pour it on  right  And the Rag  would all go to the bottom  and the Prego would sit on top. That's called  adherence.  And  anyway  despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence  and the quality of their tomato paste  Prego was struggling. So they came to Howard  and they said  fix us. And Howard looked at their product line  and he said  what you have is a dead tomato society. So he said  this is what I want to do. And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen  and he made    varieties of spaghetti sauce. And he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce  by sweetness  by level of garlic  by tomatoey ness  by tartness  by sourness  by visible solids    my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business. Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce  he varied spaghetti sauce. And then he took this whole raft of    spaghetti sauces  and he went on the road. He went to New York  to Chicago  he went to Jacksonville  to Los Angeles. And he brought in people by the truckload into big halls. And he sat them down for two hours  and over the course of that two hours  he gave them ten bowls. Ten small bowls of pasta  with a different spaghetti sauce on each one. And after they ate each bowl  they had to rate  from   to      how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was. At the end of that process  after doing it for months and months  he had a mountain of data about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce. And then he analyzed the data. Did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce  No  Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing. Instead  he looked at the data  and he said  let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters. Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas. And sure enough  if you sit down  and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce  you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups. There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain  there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy  and there are people who like it extra chunky. And of those three facts  the third one was the most significant  because at the time  in the early     s  if you went to a supermarket  you would not find extra chunky spaghetti sauce. And Prego turned to Howard  and they said   You're telling me that one third of Americans crave extra chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs   And he said  Yes   And Prego then went back  and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce  and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country. And over the next    years  they made     million dollars off their line of extra chunky sauces. Everyone else in the industry looked at Howard had done  and they said   Oh my god  We've been thinking all wrong   And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar  and    different kinds of mustard  and    different kinds of olive oil. And then eventually even Rag  hired Howard  and Howard did the exact same thing for Rag  that he did for Prego. And today  if you go to a really good supermarket  do you know how many Rag s there are      In six varieties  Cheese  Light  Robusto  Rich   Hearty  Old World Traditional    Extra Chunky Garden. That's Howard's doing. That is Howard's gift to the American people. Now why is that important  It is  in fact  enormously important. I'll explain to you why. What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy. Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat  what will make people happy  is to ask them. And for years and years and years  Rag  and Prego would have focus groups  and they would sit you down  and they would say   What do you want in a spaghetti sauce  Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce.  And for all those years           years    through all those focus group sessions  no one ever said they wanted extra chunky. Even though at least a third of them  deep in their hearts  actually did. People don't know what they want  As Howard loves to say   The mind knows not what the tongue wants.  It's a mystery  And a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want  deep down. If I asked all of you  for example  in this room  what you want in a coffee  you know what you'd say  Every one of you would say   I want a dark  rich  hearty roast.  It's what people always say when you ask them.  What do you like    Dark  rich  hearty roast   What percentage of you actually like a dark  rich  hearty roast  According to Howard  somewhere between    and    percent of you. Most of you like milky  weak coffee. But you will never  ever say to someone who asks you what you want that  I want a milky  weak coffee.  So that's number one thing that Howard did. Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize    it's another very critical point    he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call  horizontal segmentation.  Why is this critical  Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard. What were they obsessed with in the early   s  They were obsessed with mustard. In particular  they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon. Used to be  there were two mustards  French's and Gulden's. What were they  Yellow mustard. What's in it  Yellow mustard seeds  turmeric  and paprika. That was mustard. Grey Poupon came along  with a Dijon. Right  Much more volatile brown mustard seed  some white wine  a nose hit  much more delicate aromatics. And what do they do  They put it in a little tiny glass jar  with a wonderful enameled label on it  made it look French  even though it's made in Oxnard  California. And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight ounce bottle  the way that French's and Gulden's did  they decided to charge four dollars. And they had those ads. With the guy in the Rolls Royce  eating the Grey Poupon. Another pulls up  and says   Do you have any Grey Poupon   And the whole thing  after they did that  Grey Poupon takes off  Takes over the mustard business  And everyone's take home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive  something to aspire to. It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now  and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy. A better mustard  A more expensive mustard  A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning. And Howard looked to that and said   That's wrong   Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy. Mustard exists  just like tomato sauce  on a horizontal plane. There is no good mustard or bad mustard. There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard. There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people. He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste. And for that  as well  we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks. Third thing that Howard did  and perhaps the most important  is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish. What do I mean by that  For the longest time in the food industry  there was a sense that there was one way  a perfect way  to make a dish. You go to Chez Panisse  they give you the red tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction. They don't give you five options on the reduction. They don't say   Do you want the extra chunky reduction  or ...   No  You just get the reduction. Why  Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red tail sashimi.  This is the way it ought to be.  And she serves it that way time and time again  and if you quarrel with her  she will say   You know what  You're wrong  This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant.  Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well. They had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was. And where did that come from  It came from Italy. Italian tomato sauce is what  It's blended  it's thin. The culture of tomato sauce was thin. When we talked about  authentic tomato sauce  in the     s  we talked about Italian tomato sauce  we talked about the earliest Rag s  which had no visible solids  right  Which were thin  you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta. That's what it was. And why were we attached to that  Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce  A. And B  we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce  then they would embrace it. And that's what would please the maximum number of people. In other words  people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were looking for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals  because all of science  through the   th century and much of the   th  was obsessed with universals. Psychologists  medical scientists  economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that changed  right  What is the great revolution in science of the last        years  It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability. Now in medical science  we don't want to know  necessarily  just how cancer works  we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying   This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce.  And for that  we owe him a great vote of thanks. I'll give you one last illustration of variability  and that is    oh  I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that  but he took it a second step  which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food  we aren't just making an error  we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee. And coffee is something he did a lot of work with  with Nescaf . If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee    a type of coffee  a brew    that made all of you happy  and then I asked you to rate that coffee  the average score in this room for coffee would be about    on a scale of   to    . If  however  you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters  maybe three or four coffee clusters  and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters  your scores would go from    to    or   . The difference between coffee at    and coffee at    is a difference between coffee that makes you wince  and coffee that makes you deliriously happy. That is the final  and I think most beautiful lesson  of Howard Moskowitz  that in embracing the diversity of human beings  we will find a surer way to true happiness. Thank you. You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy  but other people's tragedy. It's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy than your own  and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference. So  if you believe the media accounts  being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life  in the words of Virginia Postrel. There was money  there was drugs  guns  women  you know  you name it    jewelry  bling bling    it had it all. What I'm going to tell you today is that  in fact  based on    years of research  a unique opportunity to go inside a gang    to see the actual books  the financial records of the gang    that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang was a glamorous life. But I think  more realistically  that being in a gang    selling drugs for a gang    is perhaps the worst job in all of America. And that's what I'd like to convince you of today. So there are three things I want to do. First  I want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a profound influence on inner city gangs. Secondly  I want to tell you how somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang    an interesting story  I think. And then third  I want to tell you  in a very superficial way  about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the financial records  the books  of the gang. So before I do that  just one warning  which is that this presentation has been rated 'R' by the Motion Picture Association of America. It contains adult themes  adult language. Given who is up on the stage  you'll be delighted to know that  in fact  there'll be no nudity    Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside. So let me start by talking about crack cocaine  and how it transformed the gang. To do that  you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine  in the early '  s  and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader. Being a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid '  s    the early '  s  let me say. Now  you had a lot of power  and you got to beat people up    you got a lot of prestige  a lot of respect. But the thing is  there was no money in it. The gang had no way to make money. You couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang  because the people in the gang didn't have any money. You couldn't really make any money selling marijuana    marijuana's too cheap  it turns out. You can't get rich selling marijuana. You couldn't sell cocaine  cocaine's a great product    powdered cocaine    but you've got to know rich white people. And most of the inner city gang members didn't know any rich white people  so couldn't sell to that market. You couldn't really do petty crime  either. Turns out  petty crime's a terrible way to make a living. As a result  as a gang leader  you had  you know  power    it's a pretty good life    but the thing was  in the end  you were living at home with your mother. And so it wasn't really a career. There were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother. Then along comes crack cocaine. And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell  crack cocaine was the extra chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city. Because crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation. I don't have time to talk about it today  but if you think about it  I would say that in the last    years  of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country  the biggest one in terms of impact on the well being of people who live in the inner city  was crack cocaine. And for the worse    not for the better  but for the worse. It had a huge impact on life. So what was it about crack cocaine  It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high. Because you could smoke crack cocaine    you can't smoke powdered cocaine    and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it. And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine  but when it came  it really did. And it was a perfect drug  you could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar  sell it for five dollars. Highly addictive    the high was very short. So for fifteen minutes  you get this great high  and then when you come down  all you want to do is get high again. It created a wonderful market. And for the people who were there running the gang  it was a great way  seemingly  to make a lot of money. At least for the people on the top. So this is where we enter the picture. Not really me    I'm really a bit player in all this. My co author  Sudhir Venkatesh  is the main character. He was a math major in college who had a good heart  and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD  came to the University of Chicago. Now  the three months before he came to Chicago  he had spent following the Grateful Dead. And in his own words  he  looked like a freak.  He's a South Asian    very dark skinned South Asian. Big man  and he had hair  in his words   down to his ass.  Defied all kinds of boundaries  Was he black or white  Was he man or woman  He was really a curious sight to be seen. So he showed up at the University of Chicago  and the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson was doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago. He took one look at Sudhir  who was going to go do some surveys for him  and decided he knew exactly the place to send him  which was to one of the toughest  most notorious housing projects not just in Chicago  but in the entire United States. So Sudhir  the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city  dutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project  gets to the first building. The first building  Well  there's nobody there. But he hears some voices up in the stairwell  so he climbs up the stairwell  comes around the corner  and finds a group of young African American men playing dice. This is about       peak of the crack epidemic. This is a very dangerous job  being in a gang. You don't like to be surprised. You don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner. And the mantra was  shoot first  ask questions later. Now  Sudhir was lucky    he was such a freak  and that clipboard probably saved his life  because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard. So his greeting was not particularly warm  but they did say  well  OK    let's hear your questions on your survey. So    I kid you not    the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was   How do you feel about being poor and Black in America   Makes you wonder about academics. So the choice of answers were   A  Very Good B  Good C  Bad D  Very Bad  What Sudhir found out is  in fact  that the real answer was the following   A  Very Good B  Good C  Bad D  Very Bad E  Fuck you  The survey was not  in the end  going to be what got Sudhir off the hook. He was held hostage overnight in the stairwell. There was a lot of gunfire  there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members. By morning  the gang leader arrived  checked out Sudhir  decided he was no threat  and they let him go home. So Sudhir went home  took a shower  took a nap. And you and I  probably  faced with the situation  would think   I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead  I've been following them for the last three months.  Sudhir  on the other hand  got right back  walked down to the housing project  went up to the second floor  and said   Hey  guys  I had so much fun hanging out with you last night  I wonder if I could do it again tonight.  And that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for    years  hanging out in crack houses  going to jail with the gang members  having the windows shot out of his car  having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks    you name it. But ultimately  the story has a happy ending for Sudhir  who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country. And especially for me  as I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open  waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang. It was one of the most unequal co authoring relationships ever    But I was glad to be the beneficiary of it. So what did we find  What did we find in the gang  Well  let me say one thing  We really got access to everybody in the gang. We got an inside look at the gang  from the very bottom up to the very top. They trusted Sudhir  in ways that really no academic has ever    or really anybody  any outsider    has ever earned the trust of these gangs  to the point where they actually opened up what was most interesting for me    their books  the financial records they kept. They made them available to us  and we not only could study them  but we could ask them questions about what was in them. So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is  it's that  if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization  it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's  in a lot of different respects    the restaurant McDonald's. So first  in one way  which isn't maybe the most interesting way  but it's a good way to start    is in the way it's organized  the hierarchy of the gang  the way it looks. So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like. I don't know if you know much about org charts  but if you were to assign a stripped down and simplified McDonald's org chart  this is exactly what it would look like. It's amazing  but the top level of the gang  they actually call themselves the  Board of Directors.  And Sudhir says it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view of what happened in American corporate life  but they had seen movies like  Wall Street   and they had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world. Now  below that board of directors  you've got essentially what are regional VPs    people who control  say  the South Side of Chicago  or the West Side of Chicago. Sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the Iowa franchise  which  it turned out  for this black gang  was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook. But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees. The guys who are running the local gangs    the four square block by four square block areas    they're just like the guys  in some sense  who are running the McDonald's. They are the entrepreneurs. They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug selling. They get the name of the gang behind them  for merchandising and marketing. And they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit  depending on how good they are at running the business. Now  the group I really want you to think about  though  are the ones at the bottom    the foot soldiers. These are the teenagers  typically  who'd be standing out on the street corner  selling the drugs. Extremely dangerous work. And important to note is that almost all of the weight  all of the people in this organization are at the bottom    just like McDonald's. So in some sense  the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at McDonald's  and it's not just by chance that they're like them. In fact  in these neighborhoods  they'd be the same people. So the same kids who are working in the gang were actually  at the very same time  typically working part time at a place like McDonald's. Which already foreshadows the main result that I've talked about  about what a crappy job it was  being in the gang. Because obviously  if being in the gang were such a wonderful  lucrative job  why in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's  So what do the wages look like  You might be surprised. But based on being able to talk to them and to see their records  this is what it looks like in terms of the wages. The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was   .   an hour. It was below the minimum wage. And this is well documented. It's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have. It really is not fiction    it's fact. There was very little money in the gang  especially at the bottom. Now if you managed to rise up  say  and be that local leader  the guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee  you'd be making         dollars a year. And that  in some ways  was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male. If you managed to rise to the very top          or         dollars a year is what you'd hope to make. Truly  you would be a great success story. And one of the sad parts of this is that  indeed  among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities    this is what they were striving for. They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways  because there were no legitimate channels out. This was the best way out. And it actually was the right choice  probably  to try to make it out this way. You look at this  the relationship to McDonald's breaks down here. The money looks about the same. Why is it such a bad job  Well  the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time. So  with shooting at you  what are the death rates  We found  in our gang    and admittedly  this was not really a standard situation  this was a time of intense violence  of a lot of gang wars  as this gang actually became quite successful. But there were costs. And so the death rate    not to mention the rate of being arrested  sent to prison  being wounded    the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year. You're in the gang for four years  you expect to die with about a    percent likelihood. That is about as high as you can get. So for comparison's purposes  let's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky. Let's say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder  and you're sent to death row. It turns out  the death rates on death row from all causes  including execution  two percent a year. So it's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street. That gives you some pause  for those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime. To give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack    and I'm not really focusing on the negatives  but really  there's another story to tell you there    if you look at the death rates just of random  young black males growing up in the inner city in the United States  the death rates during crack were about one percent. That's extremely high. And this is violent death    it's unbelievable  in some sense. To put it into perspective  if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq  for instance  right now fighting the war   .  percent. So in some very literal way  the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war zone  very much in the sense that the soldiers over in Iraq are fighting in a war. So why in the world  you might ask  would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner selling drugs for   .   an hour  with a    percent chance of dying over the next four years  Why would they do that  And I think there are a couple answers. I think the first one is that they got fooled by history. It used to be the gang was a rite of passage  that the young people controlled the gang  that as you got older  you dropped out of the gang. So what happened was  the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time    the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid to late '  s    became very  very wealthy. And so the logical thing to think was that they are going to age out of the gang like everybody else has  and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth. There are striking similarities  I think  to the Internet boom. The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very  very rich. And then all of my friends said   Maybe I should go do that  too.  And they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came. In some sense  that's what happened  exactly  to the set of people we were looking at. They were willing to start at the bottom  just like  say  a first year lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom  work    hour weeks for not that much money  because they think they're going to make partner. But the rules changed  and they never got to make partner. Indeed  the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late     s are still running the major gangs in Chicago today. They never passed on any of the wealth  So everybody got stuck at that   .   an hour job  and it turned out to be a disaster. The other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery. And so for instance  one thing the gang would do is    the gang leaders would have big entourages  and they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry. So what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more  is that  really  they didn't own those cars    they just leased them  because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars. And they didn't really have gold jewelry  they had gold plated jewelry. It goes back to  you know  the real real versus the fake real. And really  they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be. So for instance  they would give a    year old kid a whole roll of bills to hold. That    year old kid would say to his friends   Hey  look at all the money I got in the gang.  It wasn't his money    until he spent it  and then he was in debt to the gang  and was sort of an indentured servant for a while. So I have a couple minutes. Let me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do  which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics  from the study of the gang. So  economists tend to talk in technical words. Often  our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data  but what's kind of interesting is that in this setting  it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy worked very well in the drug economy  in some sense  because it's unfettered capitalism. Here's an economic principle. This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics  called a  compensating differential.  It's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks  one which is more unpleasant than the other. Compensating differential    it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more than people who work in parks. The words of one of the members of the gang  I think  make this clear. So it turns out    I'm sort of getting ahead of myself    it turns out  in the gang  when there's a war going on  they actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money. It's exactly this concept. Because they're not willing to be at risk. And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely  he says   Would you stand around here when all this shit ...     the shooting     ... if all this shit's going on  No  right  So if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line  then front me the cash  man.  I think the gang member says it much more articulately than the economist  about what's going on. Here's another one. Economists talk about game theory  that every two person game has a Nash equilibrium. Here's the translation you get from the gang member. They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot    One thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang  if you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang's territory    people are afraid to go buy drugs there  they're going to come into your neighborhood. Here's what he says about why they don't do that   If we start shooting around there  the other gang's territory  nobody  I mean  you dig it  nobody gonna step on their turf. But we gotta be careful  'cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked.  So that's the same concept. Then again  sometimes economists get it wrong. One thing we observed in the data is that it looked like    the gang leader always got paid. No matter how bad it was economically  he always got himself paid. We had some theories related to cash flow  and lack of access to capital markets  and things like that. Then we asked the gang member   Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid   His response is   You got all these niggers below you who want your job  you dig  If you start taking losses  they see you as weak and shit.  And I thought about it and said   CEOs often pay themselves million dollar bonuses  even when companies are losing a lot of money. And it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important.  Maybe  weak and shit  is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard  and I'll try to make some connections myself  in case you missed them. But I want to start with what I call the  official dogma.  The official dogma of what  The official dogma of all Western industrial societies. And the official dogma runs like this  if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens  the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom. The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good  valuable  worthwhile  essential to being human. And because if people have freedom  then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare  and no one has to decide on our behalf. The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice. The more choice people have  the more freedom they have  and the more freedom they have  the more welfare they have. This  I think  is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it. And it's also deeply embedded in our lives. I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us. This is my supermarket. Not such a big one. I want to say just a word about salad dressing.     salad dressings in my supermarket  if you don't count the    extra virgin olive oils and    balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings  in the off chance that none of the     the store has on offer suit you. So this is what the supermarket is like. And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system    speakers  CD player  tape player  tuner  amplifier    and in this one single consumer electronics store  there are that many stereo systems. We can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store. You've got to admit that's a lot of choice. In other domains    the world of communications. There was a time  when I was a boy  when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted  as long as it came from Ma Bell. You rented your phone. You didn't buy it. One consequence of that  by the way  is that the phone never broke. And those days are gone. We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones  especially in the world of cell phones. These are cell phones of the future. My favorite is the middle one    the MP  player  nose hair trimmer  and cr me br l e torch. And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet  you can rest assured that one day soon  you will. And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question. And do you know what the answer to this question now is  The answer is  no.  It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much. So  in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things  the same explosion of choice is true. Health care. It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor  and the doctor tells you what to do. Instead  you go to the doctor  and the doctor tells you   Well  we could do A  or we could do B. A has these benefits  and these risks. B has these benefits  and these risks. What do you want to do   And you say   Doc  what should I do   And the doc says   A has these benefits and risks  and B has these benefits and risks. What do you want to do   And you say   If you were me  Doc  what would you do   And the doc says   But I'm not you.  And the result is    we call it  patient autonomy   which makes it sound like a good thing  but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something    namely  the doctor    to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions    namely  the patient. There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me  which  if you think about it  makes no sense at all  since we can't buy them. Why do they market to us if we can't buy them  The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed. Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice  as this slide is meant to indicate. We don't inherit an identity  we get to invent it. And we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like. And that means that every day  when you wake up in the morning  you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. With respect to marriage and family  there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could  and then you started having kids as soon as you could. The only real choice was who  not when  and not what you did after. Nowadays  everything is very much up for grabs. I teach wonderfully intelligent students  and I assign    percent less work than I used to. And it's not because they're less smart  and it's not because they're less diligent. It's because they are preoccupied  asking themselves   Should I get married or not  Should I get married now  Should I get married later  Should I have kids first  or a career first   All of these are consuming questions. And they're going to answer these questions  whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses. And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer. Work    we are blessed  as Carl was pointing out  with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet    except the Randolph Hotel. There is one corner  by the way  that I'm not going to tell anybody about  where the WiFi actually works. I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it. So what this means  this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work  is that we have to make a decision  again and again and again  about whether we should or shouldn't be working. We can go to watch our kid play soccer  and we have our cell phone on one hip  and our Blackberry on our other hip  and our laptop  presumably  on our laps. And even if they're all shut off  every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game  we are also asking ourselves   Should I answer this cell phone call  Should I respond to this email  Should I draft this letter   And even if the answer to the question is  no   it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been. So everywhere we look  big things and small things  material things and lifestyle things  life is a matter of choice. And the world we used to live in looked like this.  Well  actually  they are written in stone.  That is to say  there were some choices  but not everything was a matter of choice. And the world we now live in looks like this.  The Ten Commandments DYI Kit  And the question is  is this good news  or bad news  And the answer is   yes.  We all know what's good about it  so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. All of this choice has two effects  two negative effects on people. One effect  paradoxically  is that it produces paralysis  rather than liberation. With so many options to choose from  people find it very difficult to choose at all. I'll give you one very dramatic example of this  a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard  the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about       different workplaces. And what she found is that for every    mutual funds the employer offered  rate of participation went down two percent. You offer    funds       percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why  Because with    funds to choose from  it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose  that you'll just put it off until tomorrow. And then tomorrow  and tomorrow  and tomorrow  and of course tomorrow never comes. Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away  it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer. By not participating  they are passing up as much as       dollars a year from the employer  who would happily match their contribution. So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices. And I think it makes the world look like this.  And lastly  for all eternity  French  bleu cheese  or ranch   You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity  right  You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund  or the wrong salad dressing. So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice  we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. And there are several reasons for this. One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from  if you buy one  and it's not perfect    and what salad dressing is     it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made  and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made  even if it was a good decision. The more options there are  the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose. Second  what economists call  opportunity costs.  Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to. Well  when there are lots of alternatives to consider  it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen. Here's an example.  I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W   th street  Sorry if you're not New Yorkers. Here's what you're supposed to be thinking. Here's this couple on the Hamptons. Very expensive real estate. Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves. What could be better   Well  damn it   this guy is thinking   It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away. I could be parking right in front of my building.  And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity  day after day  to have a great parking space. Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose  even when what we choose is terrific. And the more options there are to consider  the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs. Here's another example. Now this cartoon makes a lot of points. It makes points about living in the moment as well  and probably about doing things slowly. But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing  you're choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive features  and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive. Third  escalation of expectations. This hit me when I went to replace my jeans. I wear jeans almost all the time. There was a time when jeans came in one flavor  and you bought them  and they fit like crap  they were incredibly uncomfortable  if you wore them and washed them enough times  they started to feel OK. I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones  and I said   I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size.  And the shopkeeper said   Do you want slim fit  easy fit  relaxed fit  You want button fly or zipper fly  You want stonewashed or acid washed  Do you want them distressed  You want boot cut  tapered  blah blah.  On and on he went. My jaw dropped. And after I recovered  I said   I want the kind that used to be the only kind.  He had no idea what that was  so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans  and I walked out of the store    truth     with the best fitting jeans I had ever had. I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better. But    I felt worse. Why  I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. The reason    The reason I felt worse is that  with all of these options available  my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up. I had very low  no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor. When they came in     flavors  damn it  one of them should've been perfect. And what I got was good  but it wasn't perfect. And so I compared what I got to what I expected  and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected. Adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be. And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results  even when they're good results. Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.  It all looks so great. I can't wait to be disappointed.  Because if they did  you wouldn't all know what this was about. The truth is more like this.  Everything was better back when everything was worse  The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse  it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. Nowadays  the world we live in    we affluent  industrialized citizens  with perfection the expectation    the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations  my expectations  have gone through the roof. The secret to happiness    this is what you all came for    the secret to happiness is low expectations.  You'll do  I want to say    just a little autobiographical moment    that I actually am married to a wife  and she's really quite wonderful. I couldn't have done better. I didn't settle. But settling isn't always such a bad thing. Finally    One consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied  and you ask why  who's responsible  the answer is clear  the world is responsible. What could you do  When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available  and you buy one that is disappointing  and you ask why  who's responsible  It is equally clear that the answer to the question is  you.  You could have done better. With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display  there is no excuse for failure. And so when people make decisions  and even though the results of the decisions are good  they feel disappointed about them  they blame themselves. Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. I believe a significant    not the only  but a significant    contributor to this explosion of depression  and also suicide  is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high  and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves  they think they're at fault. And so the net result is that we do better in general  objectively  and we feel worse. So let me remind you. This is the official dogma  the one that we all take to be true  and it's all false. It is not true. There's no question that some choice is better than none  but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is. I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare. Now  as a policy matter    I'm almost done    as a policy matter  the thing to think about is this  what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence. There are lots of places in the world  and we have heard about several of them  where their problem is not that they have too much choice. Their problem is that they have too little. So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern  affluent  Western societies. And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this  Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install child seats don't help. It's a waste of money. What I'm telling you is that these expensive  complicated choices    it's not simply that they don't help. They actually hurt. They actually make us worse off. If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options  not only would those people's lives be improved  but ours would be improved also  which is what economists call a  Pareto improving move.  Income redistribution will make everyone better off    not just poor people    because of how all this excess choice plagues us. So to conclude.  You can be anything you want to be    no limits  You're supposed to read this cartoon  and  being a sophisticated person  say   Ah  What does this fish know  You know  nothing is possible in this fishbowl.  Impoverished imagination  a myopic view of the world    and that's the way I read it at first. The more I thought about it  however  the more I came to the view that this fish knows something. Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible  you don't have freedom. You have paralysis. If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible  you decrease satisfaction. You increase paralysis  and you decrease satisfaction. Everybody needs a fishbowl. This one is almost certainly too limited    perhaps even for the fish  certainly for us. But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery  and  I suspect  disaster. Thank you very much. When you have    minutes to speak  two million years seems like a really long time. But evolutionarily  two million years is nothing. And yet in two million years  the human brain has nearly tripled in mass  going from the one and a quarter pound brain of our ancestor here  Habilis  to the almost three pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears. What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one  Well  it turns out when brains triple in size  they don't just get three times bigger  they gain new structures. And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part  called the  frontal lobe.  Particularly  a part called the  pre frontal cortex.  What does a pre frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time  It turns out the pre frontal cortex does lots of things  but one of the most important things it does is an experience simulator. Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes. Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life. This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do  and that no other animal can do quite like we can. It's a marvelous adaptation. It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall. All of you have done this. Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver and onion ice cream  and it's not because they whipped some up  tried it and went   Yuck.  It's because  without leaving your armchair  you can simulate that flavor and say  yuck  before you make it. Let's see how your experience simulators are working. Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk. Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate. You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer. One of them is winning the lottery. This is about     million dollars. And the other is becoming paraplegic. Just give it a moment of thought. You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought. Interestingly  there are data on these two groups of people  data on how happy they are. And this is exactly what you expected  isn't it  But these aren't the data. I made these up  These are the data. You failed the pop quiz  and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture. Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs  and a year after winning the lotto  lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives. Don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz  because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time. The research that my laboratory has been doing  that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing  has revealed something really quite startling to us  something we call the  impact bias   which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly. For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are. From field studies to laboratory studies  we see that winning or losing an election  gaining or losing a romantic partner  getting or not getting a promotion  passing or not passing a college test  on and on  have far less impact  less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have. This almost floors me    a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago  with only a few exceptions  it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness. Why  Because happiness can be synthesized. Sir Thomas Brown wrote in        I am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches  adversity to prosperity. I am more invulnerable than Achilles  fortune hath not one place to hit me.  What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head  Well  it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have. Human beings have something that we might think of as a  psychological immune system.  A system of cognitive processes  largely non conscious cognitive processes  that help them change their views of the world  so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves. Like Sir Thomas  you have this machine. Unlike Sir Thomas  you seem not to know it. We synthesize happiness  but we think happiness is a thing to be found. Now  you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness  I suspect. Though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence  you don't have to look very far for evidence. As a challenge to myself  since I say this once in a while in lectures  I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness. Here are three guys synthesizing happiness.  I am so much better off physically  financially  emotionally  mentally and almost every other way.   I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.   I believe it turned out for the best.  Who are these characters who are so damn happy  The first one is Jim Wright. Some of you are old enough to remember  he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done. He lost everything. The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything. He lost his money  he lost his power. What does he have to say all these years later   I am so much better off physically  financially  mentally and in almost every other way.  What other way would there be to be better off  Vegetably  Minerally  Animally  He's pretty much covered them there. Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of. Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released. He was    years old. He'd spent    years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn't commit.  He was ultimately released for good behavior halfway through his sentence.  What did he say about his experience   I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experience.  Glorious  He is not saying   Well  there were some nice guys. They had a gym.   Glorious   a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience. Harry S. Langerman uttered these words  and he's somebody you might have known but didn't  because in      he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named McDonalds. And he thought   That's a really neat idea   So he went to find them. They said   We can give you a franchise on this for       bucks.  Harry went back to New York  asked his brother  an investment banker  to loan him the         and his brother's immortal words were   You idiot  nobody eats hamburgers.  He wouldn't lend him the money  and of course  six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea. It turns out people do eat hamburgers  and Ray Kroc  for a while  became the richest man in America. And then finally    you know  the best of all possible worlds    some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best  who was the original drummer for the Beatles  until they  you know  sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour. Well  in       when Pete Best was interviewed    yes  he's still a drummer  yes  he's a studio musician    he had this to say   I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles.  Okay. There's something important to be learned from these people  and it is the secret of happiness. Here it is  finally to be revealed. First  accrue wealth  power  and prestige  then lose it. Second  spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can. Third  make somebody else really  really rich. And finally  never ever join the Beatles. OK. Now I  like Ze Frank  can predict your next thought  which is   Yeah  right.  Because when people synthesize happiness  as these gentlemen seem to have done  we all smile at them  but we kind of roll our eyes and say   Yeah right  you never really wanted the job.   Oh yeah  right. You really didn't have that much in common with her  and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face.  We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call  natural happiness.  What are these terms  Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted  and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted. And in our society  we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind. Why do we have that belief  Well  it's very simple. What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it  With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard  a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable  because they don't want stuff enough. I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for. I'm a scientist  so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric  but by marinating you in a little bit of data. Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks. And this isn't mine. It's a    year old paradigm called the  free choice paradigm.  It's very simple. You bring in  say  six objects  and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked. In this case  because this experiment uses them  these are Monet prints. So  everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they like the most  to the one they like the least. Now we give you a choice   We happen to have some extra prints in the closet. We're going to give you one as your prize to take home. We happen to have number three and number four   we tell the subject. This is a bit of a difficult choice  because neither one is preferred strongly to the other  but naturally  people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four. Sometime later    it could be    minutes  it could be    days    the same stimuli are put before the subject  and the subject is asked to re rank the stimuli.  Tell us how much you like them now.  What happens  Watch as happiness is synthesized. This is the result that has been replicated over and over again. You're watching happiness be synthesized. Would you like to see it again  Happiness   The one I got is really better than I thought  That other one I didn't get sucks   That's the synthesis of happiness. Now  what's the right response to that   Yeah  right   Now  here's the experiment we did  and I hope this is going to convince you that  Yeah  right   was not the right response. We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia. These are hospitalized patients. Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome  a polyneuritic psychosis. They drank way too much  and they can't make new memories. OK  They remember their childhood  but if you walk in and introduce yourself  and then leave the room  when you come back  they don't know who you are. We took our Monet prints to the hospital. And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least. We then gave them the choice between number three and number four. Like everybody else  they said   Gee  thanks Doc  That's great  I could use a new print. I'll take number three.  We explained we would have number three mailed to them. We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room  and counted to a half hour. Back into the room  we say   Hi  we're back.  The patients  bless them  say   Ah  Doc  I'm sorry  I've got a memory problem  that's why I'm here. If I've met you before  I don't remember.   Really  you don't remember  I was just here with the Monet prints    Sorry  Doc  I just don't have a clue.   No problem  Jim. All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least.  What do they do  Well  let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac. We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own  which one they chose last time  which one is theirs. And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess. These are normal controls  where if I did this with you  all of you would know which print you chose. But if I do this with amnesiac patients  they don't have a clue. They can't pick their print out of a lineup. Here's what normal controls do  they synthesize happiness. Right  This is the change in liking score  the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked. Normal controls show    that was the magic I showed you  now I'm showing it to you in graphical form     The one I own is better than I thought. The one I didn't own  the one I left behind  is not as good as I thought.  Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing. Think about this result. These people like better the one they own  but they don't know they own it.  Yeah  right  is not the right response  What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really  truly changed their affective  hedonic  aesthetic reactions to that poster. They're not just saying it because they own it  because they don't know they own it. Now  when psychologists show you bars  you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people. And yet  all of us have this psychological immune system  this capacity to synthesize happiness  but some of us do this trick better than others. And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do. It turns out that freedom    the ability to make up your mind and change your mind    is the friend of natural happiness  because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy. But freedom to choose  to change and make up your mind  is the enemy of synthetic happiness. And I'm going to show you why. Dilbert already knows  of course. You're reading as I'm talking.  Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you    My printer prints a blank page after every document.   Why complain about getting free paper    Free  Aren't you just giving me my own paper    Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper  Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same    Now that you mention it  it does seem a little silkier    What are you doing    I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change.  Indeed. The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck  when we are trapped. This is the difference between dating and marriage. You go out on a date with a guy  and he picks his nose  you don't go out on another date. You're married to a guy and he picks his nose  He has a heart of gold. Don't touch the fruitcake  You find a way to be happy with what's happened. Now  what I want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves  and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage. Here's an experiment we did at Harvard. We created a black and white photography course  and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom. So we gave them cameras  they went around campus  they took    pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog  and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of. They bring us the camera  we make up a contact sheet  they figure out which are the two best pictures  and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms. And they blow two of them up  and they have two gorgeous eight by    glossies of meaningful things to them  and we say   Which one would you like to give up   They say   I have to give one up    Yes  we need one as evidence of the class project. So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice. You get to keep one  and I get to keep one.  Now  there are two conditions in this experiment. In one case  the students are told   But you know  if you want to change your mind  I'll always have the other one here  and in the next four days  before I actually mail it to headquarters      yeah   headquarters      I'll be glad to swap it out with you. In fact  I'll come to your dorm room  just give me an email. Better yet  I'll check with you. You ever want to change your mind  it's totally returnable.  The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite   Make your choice  and by the way  the mail is going out  gosh  in two minutes  to England. Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic. You will never see it again.  Half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind. Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking  satisfaction with the pictures. And look at what we find. First of all  here's what students think is going to happen. They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind  but these are not statistically significant differences. It's a very small increase  and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition. Wrong o. Bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening. Both right before the swap and five days later  people who are stuck with that picture  who have no choice  who can never change their mind  like it a lot  And people who are deliberating     Should I return it  Have I gotten the right one  Maybe this isn't the good one  Maybe I left the good one      have killed themselves. They don't like their picture  and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired  they still don't like their picture. Why  Because the  reversible  condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness. So here's the final piece of this experiment. We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say   You know  we're doing a photography course  and we can do it one of two ways. We could do it so that when you take the two pictures  you'd have four days to change your mind  or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it. Which course would you like to be in   Duh     percent of the students  two thirds  prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind. Hello     percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture. Because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows. The Bard said everything best  of course  and he's making my point here but he's making it hyperbolically   'Tis nothing good or bad   But thinking makes it so.  It's nice poetry  but that can't exactly be right. Is there really nothing good or bad  Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing  That seems like a one question IQ test. They can't be exactly the same. In more turgid prose  but closer to the truth  was the father of modern capitalism  Adam Smith  and he said this. This is worth contemplating   The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another    Some of these situations may  no doubt  deserve to be preferred to others  but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice  or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds  either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly  or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice.  In other words  yes  some things are better than others. We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures  we are at risk. When our ambition is bounded  it leads us to work joyfully. When our ambition is unbounded  it leads us to lie  to cheat  to steal  to hurt others  to sacrifice things of real value. When our fears are bounded  we're prudent  we're cautious  we're thoughtful. When our fears are unbounded and overblown  we're reckless  and we're cowardly. The lesson I want to leave you with  from these data  is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown  because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience. Thank you. Thank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager. Today I want to talk to you about the future  but first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past. My story starts way before I was born. My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz  the death camp. And she was going along the tracks  and the tracks split. And somehow    we don't really know exactly the whole story    but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp. My grandmother survived and married my grandfather. They were living in Hungary  and my mother was born. And when my mother was two years old  the Hungarian revolution was raging  and they decided to escape Hungary. They got on a boat  and yet another divergence    the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia. They got on and didn't know where they were going  and ended up in Canada. So  to make a long story short  they came to Canada. My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto  and at    she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother  but I carry on her name    her exact name  Eva Vertes    and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion  too. I found this passion not far from here  actually  when I was nine years old. My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon. And I had never been a reader when I was young    my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys  I tried Nancy Drew  I tried all that    and I just didn't like reading books. And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called  The Hot Zone.  It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus. And something about it just kind of drew me towards it. There was this big sort of bumpy looking virus on the cover  and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book  and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur  and to  actually  here where we are today  in Monterey  I read that book  and from when I was reading that book  I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine. I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book  who went into the jungles of Africa  went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on  I read every medical book I could get my hands on  and I just loved it so much. I was a passive observer of the medical world. It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought   Maybe now  you know    being a big high school kid    I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world.  I was     and I emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded. But I mean  why would they respond to a    year old  anyway  And I got to go talk to one professor  Dr. Jacobs  who accepted me into the lab. At that time  I was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology    specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system. So I started that  and worked in his lab for a year  and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals    that it really  really impaired the nervous system. The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way. And from then I wanted to look not at impairment  but at prevention of impairment. So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research  and at the same time when I was in the    I was reading in the medical library one day  and I read this article about something called  purine derivatives.  And they seemed to have cell growth promoting properties. And being naive about the whole field  I kind of thought   Oh  you have cell death in Alzheimer's which is causing the memory deficit  and then you have this compound    purine derivatives    that are promoting cell growth.  And so I thought   Maybe if it can promote cell growth  it can inhibit cell death  too.  And so that's the project that I pursued for that year  and it's continuing now as well  and found that a specific purine derivative called  guanidine  had inhibited the cell growth by approximately    percent. So I presented those results at the International Science Fair  which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life. And there I was awarded  Best in the World in Medicine   which allowed me to get in  or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world. And from then on  since I was now in this huge exciting world  I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once  but knew I couldn't really get that. And I stumbled across something called  cancer stem cells.  And this is really what I want to talk to you about today    about cancer. At first when I heard of cancer stem cells  I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells  and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future    the therapy of many diseases to come in the future  perhaps. But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time  so how did the good and bad go together  Last summer I worked at Stanford University  doing some research on cancer stem cells. And while I was doing this  I was reading the cancer literature  trying to    again    familiarize myself with this new medical field. And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell. This fascinated me. The more I read  the more I looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it. It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury. If you smoke  you damage your lung tissue  and then lung cancer arises. If you drink  you damage your liver  and then liver cancer occurs. And it was really interesting    there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture  and then bone cancer arises. Because what stem cells are    they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue. So  if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer  it's almost as if this is a repair response. And the cancer  the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged  we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair    because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue. But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response  but can't quite control it. It hasn't yet become fine tuned enough to finish what has been initiated. So this really  really fascinated me. And I really think that we can't think about cancer    let alone any disease    in such black and white terms. If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now  with chemotherapy and radiation  we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins  or with radiation  trying to kill it. It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point. We're removing the cancer cells  but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix. Shouldn't we think about manipulation  rather than elimination  If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate    to become bone tissue  lung tissue  liver tissue  whatever that cancer has been put there to do    it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer. So  this really changed my view of looking at cancer. And while I was reading all these articles about cancer  it seemed that the articles    a lot of them    focused on  you know  the genetics of breast cancer  and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer    tracking the cancer through the body  tracing where it is  where it goes. But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart  or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter. And skeletal muscle constitutes    percent of our body  or over    percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought   Well  maybe there's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer    at least not that I know of.  So  I looked further into it  found as many articles as I could  and it was amazing    because it turned out that it was very rare. Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer  and furthermore  not only to cancer  but of metastases going to skeletal muscle. And what metastases are is when the tumor    when a piece    breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is. It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous. If cancer was localized  we could likely remove it  or somehow    you know  it's contained. It's very contained. But once it starts moving throughout the body  that's when it becomes deadly. So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles  but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle    there seemed to be something here. So these articles were saying  you know   Skeletal    metastasis to skeletal muscle    is very rare.  But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why. So I decided to ask why. At first    the first thing I did was I emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle physiology  and pretty much said   Hey  it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle. Is there a reason for this   And a lot of the replies I got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue. Meaning that you have muscle cells  but they're not dividing  so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack. But then again  this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely. And furthermore  that nervous tissue    brain    gets cancer  and brain cells are also terminally differentiated. So I decided to ask why. And here's some of  I guess  my hypotheses that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami. And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers. But I know that in science  once you get the answers  inevitably you're going to have more questions. So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life. Some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle  there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle. And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells. Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels. And you think  the more highways there are in a tissue  the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases. So first of all I thought  you know   Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle   And as well  cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis  which is really  the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow. Without angiogenesis  the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful. So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer. And one article that really stood out to me when I was just reading about this  trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal muscle  was that it had reported    percent of micro metastases to skeletal muscle upon autopsy.    percent  Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle  but only .   percent of actual metastases    suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis  is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels. We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body    our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles. Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply  It needs to be constantly contracting  so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself. Therefore  when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue  it can't get a blood supply  and can't grow. So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle    or perhaps even more  an angiogenic routing factor  so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow    this could be a potential future therapy for cancer. And another thing that's really interesting is that there's this whole    the way tumors move throughout the body  it's a very complex system    and there's something called the chemokine network. And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants  and they're the stop and go signals for cancer. So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors  and another organ    a distant organ somewhere in the body    will have the corresponding chemokines  and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it. Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules  And the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle    there's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is injured  that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle. And  furthermore  when skeletal muscle is injured  that's what causes chemokines    these signals saying   Cancer  you can come to me   the  go signs  for the tumors    it causes them to highly express these chemokines. So  there's so much interplay here. I mean  there are so many possibilities for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle. But it seems like by investigating  by attacking cancer  by searching where cancer is not  there has got to be something    there's got to be something    that's making this tissue resistant to tumors. And can we utilize    can we take this property  this compound  this receptor  whatever it is that's controlling these anti tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general  Now  one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer    to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body    is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called  MyoD.  And what MyoD essentially does is  it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. So this compound  MyoD  has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells. So  is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue  but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue  MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells  Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells  and this is why it seems as if it is so rare. It's not harmful  it has just repaired the muscle. Muscle is constantly being used    constantly being damaged. If every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way  cancer occurred    I mean  everybody would have cancer almost. And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell  possibly because of all its use  has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury  to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very  very smart  and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do. It's different when a bacteria comes into the body    that's a foreign object    we want that out. But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease  it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution. So even to go from there  it's possible  although far fetched  that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy. If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating    for example Alzheimer's  where the brain  the brain cells  die and we need to restore new brain cells  new functional brain cells    what if we could  in the future  use cancer  A tumor    put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells  That's a very far fetched idea  but I really believe that it may be possible. These cells are so versatile  these cancer cells are so versatile    we just have to manipulate them in the right way. And again  some of these may be far fetched  but I figured if there's anywhere to present far fetched ideas  it's here at TED  so thank you very much.    minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit  so I'm going to dive straight in  right at the point where I get this thing to work. Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things. I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable. I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together  and actually talk about this a bit more than we do. I'm going to talk about feasibility as well  of course. I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging. And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about  you know  how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong  namely  by actually doing something about it. I'm going to do that in two steps. The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension    which I'm going to define as    years  applied to people who are already in middle age when you start    to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging. Namely  essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year    or indeed  to get sick in the first place. And of course  the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step  that point of maybe    years life extension. So I'm going to start with why we should. Now  I want to ask a question. Hands up  anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria  That was easy. OK. OK. Hands up  anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing  OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing. That's very good news  because I thought that was what the answer would be. Now the thing is  I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging. And here is that characteristic. The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does. Now  I like in an audience  in Britain especially  to talk about the comparison with foxhunting  which is something that was banned after a long struggle  by the government not very many months ago. I mean  I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here  but  as we know  a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic. And this is actually a rather good comparison  it seems to me. You know  a lot of people said   Well  you know  city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time. It's a traditional part of the way of life  and we should be allowed to carry on doing it. It's ecologically sound  it stops the population explosion of foxes.  But ultimately  the government prevailed in the end  because the majority of the British public  and certainly the majority of members of Parliament  came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society. And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades. What part of this do people not understand  It's not just about life  of course    it's about healthy life  you know    getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun  whether or not dying may be fun. So really  this is how I would like to describe it. It's a global trance. These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging. And  I mean  OK  I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless. There are some good points to be made here  things that we ought to be thinking about  forward planning so that nothing goes too    well  so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging. But these are completely crazy  when you actually remember your sense of proportion. You know  these are arguments  these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about. But the question is  are they so dangerous    these risks of doing something about aging    that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite  namely  leaving aging as it is  Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning         people a day to an unnecessarily early death  You know  if you haven't got an argument that's that strong  then just don't waste my time  is what I say. Now  there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong  and here it is. People worry about overpopulation  they say   Well  if we fix aging  no one's going to die to speak of  or at least the death toll is going to be much lower  only from crossing St. Giles carelessly. And therefore  we're not going to be able to have many kids  and kids are really important to most people.  And that's true. And you know  a lot of people try to fudge this question  and give answers like this. I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work. I think it's true  that we will face a dilemma in this respect. We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate  or a high death rate. A high death rate will  of course  arise from simply rejecting these therapies  in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids. And  I say that that's fine    the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice. What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future. If we vacillate  hesitate  and do not actually develop these therapies  then we are condemning a whole cohort of people    who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies  but will not be  because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could    we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span  and I consider that that is immoral. That's my answer to the overpopulation question. Right. So the next thing is  now why should we get a little bit more active on this  And the fundamental answer is that the pro aging trance is not as dumb as it looks. It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging. Aging is ghastly  but it's inevitable  so  you know  we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds  and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do  to do that. Like  for example  making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all. But of course  that only works when we have both of these components. And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear    and we might be in range of doing something about aging    this becomes part of the problem. This pro aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things. And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot    evangelize  I will go so far as to say  quite a lot    in order to get people's attention  and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard. So that's all I'm going to say about that. I'm now going to talk about feasibility. And the fundamental reason  I think  why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here. A very simple definition. Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place  which is to say  metabolism. This is not a completely tautological statement  it's a reasonable statement. Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars  and it also happens to us  despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self repair mechanisms  because those self repair mechanisms are not perfect. So basically  metabolism  which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next  has side effects. Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology. That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way  we can say that  you know  we have this chain of events. And there are really two games in town  according to most people  with regard to postponing aging. They're what I'm calling here the  gerontology approach  and the  geriatrics approach.  The geriatrician will intervene late in the day  when pathology is becoming evident  and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time  and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon. Of course  it's a very short term ist strategy  it's a losing battle  because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on. The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface  because  you know  prevention is better than cure. But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well. In fact  we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work    even cells we're not really too good on yet. We've discovered things like  for example  RNA interference only a few years ago  and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work. Basically  gerontology is a fine approach in the end  but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention. So then  what do we do about that  I mean  that's a fine logic  that sounds pretty convincing  pretty ironclad  doesn't it  But it isn't. Before I tell you why it isn't  I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two. Just suppose  as I said  that we do acquire    let's say we do it today for the sake of argument    the ability to confer    extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age  let's say   . I'm going to call that  robust human rejuvenation.  OK. What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today    or equivalently  of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive    would actually live  In order to answer that question    you might think it's simple  but it's not simple. We can't just say   Well  if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies  then they'll live    years longer.  That's the wrong answer. And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress. There are two sorts of technological progress really  for this purpose. There are fundamental  major breakthroughs  and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs. Now  they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames. Fundamental breakthroughs  very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough. It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun  and it took us until      to actually work out how to do it. But after that  things were pretty steady and pretty uniform. I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight. We can think  really  that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one  if you like. The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore. This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough. And you see it in all sorts of technologies. Computers  you can look at a more or less parallel time line  happening of course a bit later. You can look at medical care. I mean  hygiene  vaccines  antibiotics    you know  the same sort of time frame. So I think that actually step two  that I called a step a moment ago  isn't a step at all. That in fact  the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension  even though those people are already middle aged when the therapies arrive  will be at some sort of cusp. They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further    or maybe    years. In other words  they will be staying ahead of the game. The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us. This is a very important point for me to get across. Because  you know  most people  when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to       or more  they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to       or more. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough. They'll never be perfect  but we'll be able to fix the things that     year olds die of  before we have any     year olds. And the same for     and     and so on. I decided to give this a little name  which is  longevity escape velocity.  Well  it seems to get the point across. So  these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live  in terms of remaining life expectancy  as measured by their health  for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive. If you're already      or even if you're       and an average    year old  we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies  because you're too close to death's door for the really initial  experimental therapies to be good enough for you. You won't be able to withstand them. But if you're only     then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and  you know    eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense  in terms of your youthfulness  both physical and mental  and in terms of your risk of death from age related causes. And of course  if you're a bit younger than that  then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age related causes. So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to  that the first     year old    we don't know how old that person is today  because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first generation therapies. But irrespective of that age  I'm claiming that the first person to live to          subject of course  to  you know  global catastrophes    is actually  probably  only about    years younger than the first     year old. And that's quite a thought. Alright  so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk  my last seven and a half minutes  on step one  namely  how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity  And in order to do that  I need to talk about mice a little bit. I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation. I'm calling it  robust mouse rejuvenation   not very imaginatively. And this is what it is. I say we're going to take a long lived strain of mouse  which basically means mice that live about three years on average. We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old. And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them  and with those therapies  we get them to live  on average  to their fifth birthday. So  in other words  we add two years    we treble their remaining lifespan  starting from the point that we started the therapies. The question then is  what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans  Which we can now  as I've explained  equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity. Secondly  what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things  starting from the time we get the mice  And thirdly  the question is  what will it do to actually how much people want it  And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question  and it's extremely hard to answer. One has to be very speculative  and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation  that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more. I say that's nonsense. I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this. We need to give our best guess as to the time frame  in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities. So  I say that we have a       chance of reaching this RHR milestone  robust human rejuvenation  within    years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.    years from the robust mouse. The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that. The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are. So they'll probably think it's five years away. They'll be wrong  but that actually won't matter too much. And finally  of course  I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier  the coping strategy. That will be history at this point  because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans  since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice. So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes  and of course that has enormous implications. So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice  I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging. I'm going to use this word  damage  to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology. Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology  the damage itself is caused ongoing ly throughout life  starting before we're born. But it is not part of metabolism itself. And this turns out to be useful. Because we can re draw our original diagram this way. We can say that  fundamentally  the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage. And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment. And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology. And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate. So there's a third approach  if we look at it this way. We can call it the  engineering approach   and I claim that the engineering approach is within range. The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes. It does not intervene in this process or this one. And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle  and it's something that we are within range of being able to do  because it doesn't involve improving on evolution. The engineering approach simply says   Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage    not necessarily repair them completely  but repair them quite a lot  so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist  that causes it to be pathogenic.  We know that this threshold exists  because we don't get age related diseases until we're in middle age  even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born. Why do I say that we're in range  Well  this is basically it. The point about this slide is actually the bottom. If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging  we will be here all night  because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another. This list is just for illustration  it is incomplete. The list on the right is also incomplete. It's a list of types of pathology that are age related  and it's just an incomplete list. But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete    this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage  side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end  or that might cause pathology. And there are only seven of them. They're categories of things  of course  but there's only seven of them. Cell loss  mutations in chromosomes  mutations in the mitochondria and so on. First of all  I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete. Of course one can make a biological argument. One can say   OK  what are we made of   We're made of cells and stuff between cells. What can damage accumulate in  The answer is  long lived molecules  because if a short lived molecule undergoes damage  but then the molecule is destroyed    like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis    then the damage is gone  too. It's got to be long lived molecules. So  these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news  because it means that  you know  we've come a long way in biology in these    years  so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done. However  it's better than that  we actually know how to fix them all  in mice  in principle    and what I mean by in principle is  we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade. Some of them are partially implemented already  the ones at the top. I haven't got time to go through them at all  but my conclusion is that  if we can actually get suitable funding for this  then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only    years  but we do need to get serious about it. We do need to really start trying. So of course  there are some biologists in the audience  and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have. You may have been dissatisfied with this talk  but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff. I've published a great deal on this  I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based  and there's quite a lot of detail there. The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here. So if you think that I'm wrong  you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong. And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because  as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field  you know  you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously. So  you know  you've got to actually do your homework  in order to understand whether this is true. And we'll just end with a few things. One thing is  you know  you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time  and everyone said   Well  it's obviously impossible.  And you know what happened. So  you know  this does happen. We have various strategies    there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize  which is basically an incentive to innovate  and to do what you think is going to work  and you get money for it if you win. There's a proposal to actually put together an institute. This is what's going to take a bit of money. But  I mean  look    how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq  Not very long. OK. It's got to be philanthropic  because profits distract biotech  but it's basically got a    percent chance  I think  of succeeding in this. And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there. Thank you. Chris Anderson  OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance. Audience  Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it  why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man  AG  Because I am an old man. I am actually    . Audience  Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate. However  as far as I know  all the species have evolved to actually die  so when cells divide  the telomerase get shorter  and eventually species die. So  why does    evolution has    seems to have selected against immortality  when it is so advantageous  or is evolution just incomplete  AG  Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer. I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question  which I happen to agree with  which is that  no  aging is not a product of selection  evolution   aging  is simply a product of evolutionary neglect. In other words  we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging  you need more genetic pathways  more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly  and that carries on being true the longer you push it out. So  to the extent that evolution doesn't matter  doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals  living a long time or by procreation  there's a certain amount of modulation of that  which is why different species have different lifespans  but that's why there are no immortal species. CA  The genes don't care but we do  AG  That's right. Audience  Hello. I read somewhere that in the last    years  the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by    years. If I project that  that would make me think that I would live until     if I don't crash on my motorbike. That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a       year old  AG  If you lose a bit of weight. Your numbers are a bit out. The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade. So  it's not quite as good as you might think  you might hope. But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible. Audience  I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo  and that the brain cells last    years or so. If that is indeed true  biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation  If there are cells in my body that live all    years  as opposed to a typical  you know  couple of months  AG  There are technical implications certainly. Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate  especially neurons  but we don't want to replace them any faster than that    or not much faster anyway  because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function. What I said about there being no non aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification. There are species that have no aging    Hydra for example    but they do it by not having a nervous system    and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long lived cells. I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute. Before I tell that story  we should ask ourselves the question  Why does poverty exist  I mean  there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs. We all live in the same planet  but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world. And I think    so I want to throw a perspective that I have  so that we can assess this project  or any other project  for that matter  to see whether it's contributing or    contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it. Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last    years. And by and large  this has failed. And you can see this book  written by someone who worked in the World Bank for    years  and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive. By and large  it did not work. So the question is  why is that  In my mind  there is something to learn from the history of Europe. I mean  even here  yesterday I was walking across the street  and they showed three bishops were executed     years ago  right across the street from here. So my point is  there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe  where citizens were empowered by technologies. And they demanded authorities from    to come down from their high horses. And in the end  there's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens  and democracies  capitalism    everything else flourished. And so you can see  the real process of    and this is backed up by this     page book    that the authorities came down and citizens got up. But if you look  if you have that perspective  then you can see what happened in the last    years. Aid actually did the opposite. It empowered authorities  and  as a result  marginalized citizens. The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business. Because they were getting it from abroad. And in fact  if you see oil rich countries  where citizens are not yet empowered  the same thing goes    Nigeria  Saudi Arabia  all sorts of countries. Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way. It empowers authorities  without activating the citizens    their hands  legs  brains  what have you. And if you agree with that  then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people  by the people  for the people. And that is the real network effect. If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive  so that their voices are heard  so then things would improve. And to contrast that  you can see the most important institution in the world  the World Bank  is an organization of the government  by the government  for the governments. Just see the contrast. And that is the perspective I have  and then I can start my story. Of course  how would you empower citizens  There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones. Recently  The Economist  recognized this  but I stumbled upon the idea    years ago  and that's what I've been working on. So    years ago  I was trying to be an investment banker in New York. We had    quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network. And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks  we could update each other more often. But one time it broke down. And it reminded me of a day in     . There was a war going on in my country. And my family moved out of an urban place  where we used to live  to a remote rural area where it was safer. And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling. And I walked    miles or so  all morning  to get there  to the medicine man. And he wasn't there  so I walked all afternoon back. So I had another unproductive day. So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York  I put those two experiences together side by side  and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity    whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village. So naturally  I    the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty. And if that's the case  then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time  And it turns out  that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every     people. And all those phones were in the few urban places. The vast rural areas  where     million people lived  there were no telephones. So just imagine how many man months or man years are wasted  just like I wasted a day. If you just multiply by     million people  let's say losing one day a month  whatever  and you see a vast amount of resource wasted. And after all  poor countries  like rich countries  one thing we've got equal  is their days are the same length     hours. So if you lose that precious resource  where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries  that's a huge waste. So I started looking for any evidence that    does connectivity really increase productivity  And I couldn't find much  really  but I found this graph produced by the ITU  which is the International Telecommunication Union  based in Geneva. They show an interesting thing. That you see  the horizontal axis is where you place your country. So the United States or the UK would be here  outside. And so the impact of one new telephone  which is on the vertical axis  is very little. But if you come back to a poorer country  where the GNP per capita is  let's say      dollars  or     dollars  then the impact is huge        dollars. Or       dollars. The question was  how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh  It turns out        dollars. So if you spend       dollars  and let's say the telephone lasts    years  and if       dollars every year    so that's        dollars. So obviously this was a gadget to have. And of course  if the cost of installing a telephone is going down  because there's a digital revolution going on  then it would be even more dramatic. And I knew a little economics by then    it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity. But how would you specialize  Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer. And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists. So the point is that we could only    the only way we could depend on each other  is if we can connect with each other. And if we are neighbors  I could just walk over to his house. But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area. But in order to expand that  you need a river  or you need a highway  or you need telephone lines. But in any event  it's connectivity that leads to dependability. And that leads to specialization. That leads to productivity. So the question was  I started looking at this issue  and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York. There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones. And one of them is the lacking buying power. Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy. But the point is  if it's a production tool  why do we have to worry about that  I mean  in America  people buy cars  and they put very little money down. They get a car  and they go to work. The work pays them a salary  the salary allows them to pay for the car over time. The car pays for itself. So if the telephone is a production tool  then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power. And of course  even if that's true  then what about initial buying power  So then the question is  why can't we have some kind of shared access  In the United States  we have    everybody needs a banking service  but very few of us are trying to buy a bank. So it's    a bank tends to serve a whole community. So we could do that for telephones. And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet  food  clothing  shelter  whatever. But again  it's very paternalistic. You should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money. But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures. See  you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing. For instance  the Internet was booming in the U.S. because there were    there were people who had computers. They had modems. They had telephone lines  so it's very easy to bring in a new idea  like the Internet. But that's what's lacking in a poor country. So for example  we didn't have ways to have credit checks  few banks to collect bills  etc. But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank  which is a bank for poor people  and had       branches         employees   .  million borrowers. And they had these branches. I thought I could put cell towers and create a network. And anyway  to cut the time short    so I started    I first went to them and said   You know  perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient.  But you know  they have  after all  evolved in a country without telephones  so they are decentralized. I mean  of course there might be other good reasons  but this was one of the reasons    they had to be. And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches  and then to be    and rock the boat. So I started focusing. What is it that they really do  So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank. She typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk. And she sells the milk to the villagers  and pays off the loan. And this is a business for her  but it's milk for everybody else. And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow. Because some way she could borrow     dollars from the bank  get a phone and have the phone for everybody. And it's a business for her. So I wrote to the bank  and they thought for a while  and they said   It's a little crazy  but logical. If you think it can be done  come and make it happen.  So I quit my job  I went back to Bangladesh. I created a company in America called Gonofone  which in Bengali means  people's phone.  And angel investors in America put in money into that. I flew around the world. After about a million    I mean  I got rejected from lots of places  because I was not only trying to go to a poor country  I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country. After about a million miles  and a meaningful    a substantial loss of hair  I eventually put together a consortium  and    which involved the Norwegian telephone company  which provided the know how  and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service. To make the story short  here is the coverage of the country. You can see it's pretty much covered. Even in Bangladesh  there are some empty places. But we are also investing around another     million dollars this year to extend that coverage. Now  about that cow model I talked about. There are about         people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods. And it's serving        villages  which represent about    million people. And these phones are generating about     million dollars for the company. And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day  which is like     dollars per year. And of course  it's very beneficial in a lot of ways. It increases income  improves welfare  etc. And the result is  right now  this company is the largest telephone company  with  .  million subscribers          of these phones I talked about    that produces about a third of the traffic in the network. And       the net profit  after taxes    very serious taxes    was     million dollars. And the company contributed about     million dollars to the government coffers. And again  here are some of the lessons.  The government needs to provide economically viable services.  Actually  this is an instance where private companies can provide that.  Governments need to subsidize private companies.  This is what some people think. And actually  private companies help governments with taxes.  Poor people are recipients.  Poor people are a resource.  Services cost too much for the poor.  Their involvement reduces the cost.  The poor are uneducated and cannot do much.  They are very eager learners and very capable survivors. I've been very surprised. Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.  Poor countries need aid.  Businesses    this one company has raised the    if the ideal figures are even five percent true  this one company is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives. And as I was trying to show you  as far as I'm concerned  aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens. And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen  the famous inventor in America. He has produced some power generators  which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh  in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas  which is running these generators. And each of these generators is selling electricity to    houses each. It's just an experiment. We don't know how far it will go  but it's going on. Thank you. I want to start with a story  a la Seth Godin  from when I was    years old. My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater    at least I thought it was beautiful. And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach  and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest  that were also fuzzy. And I wore it whenever I could  thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned. Until one day in ninth grade  when I was standing with a number of the football players. And my body had clearly changed  and Matt  who was undeniably my nemesis in high school  said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips  but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz. And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater. We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously  my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again. Fast forward       years later  I'm a    year old kid. I'm working in Kigali  Rwanda  jogging through the steep slopes  when I see     feet in front of me  a little boy       years old    running toward me  wearing my sweater. And I'm thinking  no  this is not possible. But so  curious  I run up to the child    of course scaring the living bejesus out of him    grab him by the collar  turn it over  and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater. I tell that story  because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth. We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know. I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be. That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia  and moved its way into the larger industry  which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia. Which was a very good thing  providing low cost clothing. And at the same time  certainly in Rwanda  it destroyed the local retailing industry. Not to say that it shouldn't have  but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses. So  I'm going to stick in Rwanda  circa             where I was doing two things. I had started a bakery with    unwed mothers. We were called the  Bad News Bears   and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali  which was not hard because there were no snacks before us. And because we had a good business model  we actually did it  and I watched these women transform on a micro level. But at the same time  I started a micro finance bank  and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen  which is the grandfather of all micro finance banks  which now is a worldwide movement    you talk about a meme    but then it was quite new  especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade. We got a lot of things right. We focused on a business model  we insisted on skin in the game. The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses  earn more income so they could take care of their families better. What we didn't understand  what was happening all around us  with the confluence of fear  ethnic strife and certainly an aid game  if you will  that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda  that at that time     percent of the budget was all foreign aid. The genocide happened in       seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream. And the good news was that the institution  the banking institution  lasted. In fact  it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country. The bakery was completely wiped out  but the lessons for me were that accountability counts    got to build things with people on the ground  using business models where  as Steven Levitt would say  the incentives matter. Understand  however complex we may be  incentives matter. So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world  that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist  on the one hand I absolutely agree with him  and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G     that the world  because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof    the world is talking about global poverty  the world is talking about Africa in ways I have never seen in my life. It's thrilling. And at the same time  what keeps me up at night is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G        billion dollars in increased aid to Africa     billion in reduced debt    as the victory  as more than chapter one  as our moral absolution. And in fact  what we need to do is see that as chapter one  celebrate it  close it  and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution  all about the how to. And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today  it's that the only way to end poverty  to make it history  is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor  in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. If we do that  we really can make poverty history. And it was that    that whole philosophy    that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called  Acumen Fund   which is trying to build some mini blueprints for how we might do that in water  health and housing in Pakistan  India  Kenya  Tanzania and Egypt. And I want to talk a little bit about that  and some of the examples  so you can see what it is that we're doing. But before I do this    and this is another one of my pet peeves    I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are. Because we too often talk about them as these strong  huge masses of people yearning to be free  when in fact  it's quite an amazing story. On a macro level  four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day. That's who we talk about when we think about  the poor.  If you aggregate it  it's the third largest economy on Earth  and yet most of these people go invisible. Where we typically work  there's people making between one and three dollars a day. Who are these people  They are farmers and factory workers. They work in government offices. They're drivers. They are domestics. They typically pay for critical goods and services like water  like healthcare  like housing  and they pay    to    times what their middleclass counterparts pay    certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi. The poor also are willing to make  and do make  smart decisions  if you give them that opportunity. So  two examples. One is in India  where there are     million farmers  most of whom make less than two dollars a day. Where we work in Aurangabad  the land is extraordinarily parched. You see people on average making    cents to a dollar. This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar. What he did was see what was happening in Israel  larger approaches  and figure out how to do a drip irrigation  which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock. But previously it's only been created for large scale farms  so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre. A couple of principles  build small. Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor. This family  Sarita and her husband  bought a    dollar unit when they were living in a    literally a three walled lean to with a corrugated iron roof. After one harvest  they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter acre. A couple of years later  I meet them. They now make four dollars a day  which is pretty much middle class for India  and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house. And I swear  you could see the future in that woman's eyes. Something I truly believe. You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets  and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage    for five dollars you can save a life. Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.     to     million cases are reported. It's estimated that Africa loses about    billion dollars a year to the disease. Five dollars can save a life. We can send people to the moon  we can see if there's life on Mars    why can't we get five dollar nets to     million people  The question  though  is not  Why can't we   The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves  A lot of hurdles. One  production is too low. Two  price is too high. Three  this is a good road in    right near where our factory is located. Distribution is a nightmare  but not impossible. We started by making a         dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long lasting  five year nets. Here are just some pictures of the factory. Today  three years later  the company has employed another thousand women. It contributes about         dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania. It's the largest company in Tanzania. The throughput rate right now is  .  million nets  three million by the end of the year. We hope to have seven million at the end of next year. So the production side is working. On the distribution side  though  as a world  we have a lot of work to do. Right now     percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.  and then given primarily to people around Africa. We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa  people. Their women. And so I want you to meet Jacqueline  my namesake     years old. If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania  I'm telling you  she could run Wall Street. She runs two of the lines  and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house. She makes about two dollars a day  is creating an education fund  and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed. And so  when I told her about our idea    that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States  and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others    she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up. We took a lesson from IDEO  one of our favorite companies  and quickly did a prototyping on this  and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives. She brought    of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets  five dollars apiece  despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one  and we learned a lot about how you sell things. Not coming in with our own notions  because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end. First  she talked about comfort  status  beauty. These nets  she said  you put them on the floor  bugs leave your house. Children can sleep through the night  the house looks beautiful  you hang them in the window. And we've started making curtains  and not only is it beautiful  but people can see status    that you care about your children. Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives. A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor. I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history. To do it right  we have to build business models that matter  that are scaleable and that work with Africans  Indians  people all over the developing world who fit in this category  to do it themselves. Because at the end of the day  it's about engagement. It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts  that they want to make their own decisions  they want to solve their own problems  and that by engaging with them  not only do we create much more dignity for them  but for us as well. And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have    to make poverty history    by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us and them world  and realizing that it's about all of us  and the kind of world that we  together  want to live in and share. Thank you. A public  Dewey long ago observed  is constituted through discussion and debate. If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question  and avoid doxa  the realm of the unquestioned  then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion. It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time  namely  how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building. To put the assumptions very clearly  capitalism  after     years  has become acceptable  and so has democracy. If we looked in the world of      and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities  they were the rare exception  not the norm. The question now  however  is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation. But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions. And that provides the ground for a type of action  because consensus of each moment allows us to act. And it is necessary  no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus  to be able to move forward. But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive  as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights  about denial of justice  rather than provision of it. And in terms of experience of capitalism  there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences. First  extractive industry. Blood diamonds  smuggled emeralds  timber  that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance. And technical assistance might shock you  but it's the worst form of    today    of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to       dollars a day  who are incapable of thinking creatively  or organically. Next assumption    and of course the events of July    I express my deep sympathy  and before that  September       have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds. We live in one world. But that's easily said. But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in. And that is that if we want to have one world  this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion  and then inclusion for some. We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world  in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope. Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history  where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics. What is one of these organizations to pick  We have three critical terms  economy  civil society and the state. I will not deal with those first two  except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions  from one context to another  can only make for disaster. Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context. My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia. Textbook economics does not work in my context  and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy. The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward  and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling  for which I have enormous respect. My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best. Second  instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state  why don't we simplify and say  what are a series of functions that the state in the   st century must perform  Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this  we hope to share that much widely with    and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places. So what are these functions  We propose   . And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence  administrative control  management of public finances  investment in human capital  provision of citizenship rights  provision of infrastructure  management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation  creation of the market  international agreements  including public borrowing  and then  most importantly  rule of law. I won't elaborate. I hope the questions will give me an opportunity. This is a feasible goal  basically because  contrary to widespread assumption  I would argue that we know how to do this. Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today  if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of       But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning. And there are lots of other examples. Now in order to do this    and this brings this group    we have to rethink the notion of capital. The least important form of capital  in this project  is financial capital    money. Money is not capital in most of the developing countries. It's just cash. Because it lacks the institutional  organizational  managerial forms to turn it into capital. And what is required is a combination of physical capital  institutional capital  human capital    and security  of course  is critical  but so is information. Now  the issue that should concern us here    and that's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group    is again  it takes    years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree. It takes    years to produce somebody with a Ph.D. The first challenge is to rethink  fundamentally  the issue of the time. Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited  Our educational systems are inherited from the   th century. What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re engage in a project  that capital formation is rapid  The absolute majority of the world's population are below     and they are growing larger and faster. They need different ways of being approached  different ways of being enfranchised  different ways of being skilled. And that's the first thing. Second is  you're problem solvers  but you're not engaging your global responsibility. You've stayed away from the problems of corruption. You only want clean environments in which to function. But if you don't think through the problems of corruption  who will  You stay away from design for development. You're great designers  but your designs are selfish. It's for your own immediate use. The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads  or dams  or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in    years. This is not right. It requires thinking. But  particularly  what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work. As the work on paradigms  long time ago showed    Thomas Kuhn's work    it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments    true breakthroughs    occur. And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor  through this means. Thank you. Chris Anderson  So  Ashraf  until recently  you were the finance minister of Afghanistan  a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda. Is the country gonna make it  Will democracy flourish  What scares you most  Ashraf Ghani  What scares me most is    is you  lack of your engagement. You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer. No. But seriously  the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as  at least  a     to    year perspective. Today the world of globalization is on speed. Time has been compressed. And space does not exist for most people. But in my world    you know  when I went back to Afghanistan after    years  space had expanded. Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down. I rode    traveled    travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took   . So the first is when the scale is that  we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure    it takes six years to deliver infrastructure. In our world. Any meaningful sort of thing. But the modality of attention  or what is happening today  what's happening tomorrow. Second is  when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense  brutal forms of exercise of power    we had the Red Army for    continuous years          strong  literally terrorizing. The sky  every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear. We were bombed practically out of existence. Then  tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism    from all sides. The United States  Great Britain  joined for instance  Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism. How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror. How to turn a donkey  a carthorse  anything. And the Russians  equally. So  when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan  it's because of that legacy. But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky. I mean  I really can't believe how lucky I am here  standing in front of you  speaking. When I joined as finance minister  I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent. Those were the risks. They were worth it. I think we can make it  and the reason we can make it is because of the people. You see  because  I mean    I give you one statistic.    percent of the men in Afghanistan     percent of the women  listen to at least three radio stations a day. In terms of their discourse  in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world  I think that I would dare say  they're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans    because the world matters to them. And what is their predominant concern  Abandonment. Afghans have become deeply internationalist. You know  when I went back in December of       I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist. And I told them    my people  with the Americans here    separate. Yes  I have an advisory position with the U.N. I went through    Afghan provinces very rapidly. And everybody was telling me it was a different world. You know  they engage. They see engagement  global engagement  as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people. And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is    Clare Lockhart is here  so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan. And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table. What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future  where her children could really have a different life. That gives me hope. CA  How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade  AG  Certainly. Well  the first is  instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies  they should give this hundred billion dollars to    of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs. The key to the drug eradication is jobs. Look  there's a very little known fact  countries that have a legal average income per capita of       dollars don't produce drugs. Second  textile. Trade is the key  not aid. The U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff. The textile industry is incredibly mobile. If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment  we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector  if there was zero tariffs    would create the type of job. Cotton does not compete with opium  a t shirt does. And we need to understand  it's the value chain. Look  the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit. It is important  but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro production want is global access. They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners    and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again. What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms. Yeah  we have the best embroiderers in the world  Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy  With the Put Out system  So I think economically  the critical issue really is to now think through. And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work. You know  the aid system is broken. The aid system does not have the knowledge  the vision  the ability. I'm all for it  after all  I raised a lot of it. Yeah  to be exact  you know  I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country   .  billion. They didn't want to give us the money. CA  And it still didn't work  AG  No. It's not that it didn't work. It's that a dollar of private investment  in my judgment  is equal at least to    dollars of aid  in terms of the dynamic that it generates. Second is that one dollar of aid could be    cents  it could be    cents  or it could be four dollars. It depends on what form it comes  what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it. You know  the aid system  at first  was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries  not to generate growth in the poor countries. And this is  again  one of those assumptions    the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments  and doors. You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries  provide advice  but they do. There's an entire weight of history vis a vis aid that now needs to be reexamined. If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves    and I'm putting that proposition equally  you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts    aid must end in each country in a definable period. And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy. Unless that kind of compact is entered into  you will not be able to sustain the consensus. Video  Narrator  An event seen from one point of view gives one impression. Seen from another point of view  it gives quite a different impression. But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on. Sasha Vucinic  It's a great clip  isn't it  And I found that in    seconds  it tells more about the power of  and importance of  independent media than I could say in an hour. So I thought that it will be good to start with it. And also start with a little bit of statistics. According to relevant researchers     percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press. Think about that number     percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries. The information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information  or colors that information  does something with it. So they're deprived of understanding their reality. That is just to understand how big and important this problem is. Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent    percent  I think should enjoy it until it lasts. You know  Sunday morning  you flick the paper  get your cappuccino. Enjoy it while it lasts. Because as we heard yesterday  countries can lose stars from their flags  but they can also lose press freedom  as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about. But that's totally another and separate topic. So I can go back to my story. My story starts    the story I want to share    starts in     . At that time I was running B    the only independent  for that matter the only electronic media  in the country. And I guess we were sharing    we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country  operating in hostile environment  where government really wants to make your life miserable. And there are different ways. Yeah  it was the usual cocktail  a little bit of threats  a little bit of friendly advice  a little bit of financial police  a little bit of text control  so you always have somebody who never leaves your office. But what they really do  which is very powerful  and that is what governments in the late '  s started doing if they don't like independent media companies    you know  they threaten your advertisers. Once they threaten your advertisers  market forces are actually  you know  destroyed  and the advertisers do not want to come    no matter how much does it make sense for them    do not want to come and advertise. And you have a problem making ends meet. At that time at the beginning of the '  s  we had that problem  which was  you know  survival below one side  but what was really painful for me was  remember  the beginning of the '  s  Yugoslavia is falling apart. We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall  in a slow motion downfall. And we all had all of that on tapes. We had the ability to understand what was going on. We were actually recording history. The problem was that we had to re tape that history a week later  because if we did not  we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history. So if I gave you that picture  I don't want to go too long on that. In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time. It was still     . He was running a media systems organization which is still in business  the gentleman is still in business. And what did I know at that time about media systems  I would think media systems were organizations  which means they should help you. So I prepared two plans for that meeting  two strategic plans  the small one and the big one. The small one was  I just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes  so we can keep that archive for the next    years. The big plan was to ask him for a           dollar loan. Because I thought  I still maintain  that serious and independent media companies are great business. And I thought that B   will survive and be a great company once Milosevic is gone  which turned out to be true. It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country. And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was           dollar loan to take us through those hard times. To make a long story short  the gentleman comes into the office  great suit and tie. I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be. Actually  I underestimated the atrocities  I have to admit. Anyway  after that whole  big  long explanation  the only question he had for me    and this is not a joke    is  are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of Michael Jackson  That was really the only question he had. He left  and I remember being actually very angry at myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies. It's so obvious  straight in your face  and somebody must have thought of it. Somebody must have started something like that. And I thought  I'm just dumb and I cannot find it. You know  in my defense  there was no Google at that time  you could not just Google in '  . So I thought that that's actually my problem. Now we go from here  fast forward to     . I have    I left the country  I have a meeting with George Soros  trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank. And basically what I was saying is very simple. You know  forget about charity  it doesn't work. Forget about handouts         dollars do not help anybody. What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business. It's business anywhere. Media business  or any other business  it needs to be capitalized. And what these guys need  actually  is access to capital. So third meeting  arguments are pretty well exercised. At the end of the meeting he says  look  it is not going to work  you will never see your money back  but my foundations will put         dollars so you can test the idea. See that it will not work. He said  I'll give you a rope to hang yourself. I knew two things after that meeting. First  under no circumstances I want to hang myself. And second  that I have no idea how to make it work. You see  at the level of a concept  it was a great concept. But it's one thing to have a concept  it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work. So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work. Had the wrong idea  I thought that we can be a bank. You see banks    I don't know if there are any bankers over here  I apologize in advance    but it's the best job in the world. You know  you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money. You give them more money  they repay you that over a time. You collect interest and do nothing in between. So I thought  why don't we get into that business  So here we are having our first client  brilliant. First independent newspaper in Slovakia. The government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava. So here's the daily newspaper that has to be printed     kilometers away from the capital. It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of   p.m. That means that they have no sports  they have no latest news  circulation goes down. It's a kind of very nice  sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper. They come to us with a request for a loan. They want to    the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press. And we said  that's fine  let's meet  you'll bring us your business plan  which eventually they did. We start the meeting. I get these two pieces of paper  not like this  A  format  so it's much bigger. A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers. But however you put it  you know  the numbers do not make any sense. And that's the best they could do. We were the best that they could do. So that is how we understood what our method is. It's not a bank. We had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them    by establishing management systems  by providing all that knowledge  how do you run a business on one side    while they all know how to run  how to create content. Just quickly on the results. Over these    years     million dollars in affordable financing  average interest rate five percent to six percent. Lately we are going wild  charging seven percent from time to time. We do it in    countries of the developing world. And here is the most stunning number. Return rate    the one that Soros was so worried about       percent.    percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time. What do we typically finance  We finance anything that a media company would need  from printing presses to transmitters. What is most important is we do it either in form of loans  equities  lease    whatever is appropriate for  you know  supporting anybody. But what is most important here is  who do we finance  We believe that in the last    years companies that we've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world. That is a  Who is Who  list. And I could spend hours talking about them  because they're all kind of heroes. And I can  but I'll give you just  maybe one  and depending on time I may give you two examples who we work with. You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe  and moved to Russia. Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk. I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place. In the south of Russia there's a guy called Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin  who is running an independent newspaper there. The city was closed until early '  s because  of all things  they were producing glass for Tupolev planes. Anyway  he's running independent newspaper there. After two years working with us  he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place. Governor comes to him one day  actually invites him to come to his office. He goes and sees the governor. The governor says  Boris Nikolayevich  I understand you are doing a great job  and you are the most respected newspaper in our district. And I want to offer you a deal. Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months  because I have elections    there are elections coming up in nine months. I will not run  but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me. So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you. I have no interest in being in media business. How much would that cost  Boris Nikolayevich says   It's not for sale.  The governor says   We will close you.  Boris Nikolayevich says   No  you cannot do it.  Six months later the newspaper was closed. Luckily  we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one  to get all the subscription lists  rehire staff. So what the governor got was an empty shell. But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media  and if you are a banker for independent media. So it sounds like a great story. Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center. We started our media lab  sounds like a real great story. But there is a second angle to that. The second angle  like in this clip. If you take the camera above  you start thinking about these numbers again.    million dollars over    years spread over    countries. That is not too much  is it  It's actually just a drop in the sea. Because when you think about the importance  some of the issues that we were talking about last night    this last session we had about Africa and his hypothetical    billion dollars destined for Africa. All of those  not all  half of those problems mentioned last night    government accountability  corruption  how do you fight corruption  giving voice to unheard  to poor    it's why independent media is in business. And it's why it was invented. So from that perspective  what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify. Now ours is just one story. I'm sure that in this room there are  like     other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work. Here is where the problem is  and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is. And it's called fundraising. Imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations. Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations  doing very important work. Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf  does not hear  and switch the lights off. Now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room. So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform  to totally rethink fundraising. You know  instead of people running in this dark  trying to find their own match  who will be willing  who has the same goals. Instead of all of that we thought there is    something new needs to be invented. And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds  press freedom bonds. If there are investors willing to finance U.S. government budget deficit  why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit  We've decided to do it this fall  we will issue them  probably in denominations of       dollars. I don't want to advertise them too much  that's not the point. But the point is  if we ever survive to actually issue them  find enough investors that this can be considered a success  there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring. And those can be environmental bonds. And then two weeks later  Iqbal Quadir can issue his electricity in Bangladesh bonds. And before you know it  any social cause can be actually financed in this way. Now we do daydreaming in       with    seconds left. But let's take the idea further. You do it  you start it in the States  because it's  you know  concepts are very  very close to American minds. But you can actually bring it to Europe  too. You can bring it to Asia. You can  once you have all of those different points  you can make it easy for investors. Put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click. Once you have more than    of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix. What do investors get  On one side financial  on the other side social. So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency  Morningstar type. It says  you know  social impact over here is spectacular  five stars. Financial  they give you one percent  only one star. Now take it to the last step. Once you have all of that put together  there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have a marketplace for all of that  where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way. And in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms  no blind people running around to find each other. Thank you. I want to start off by saying  Houston  we have a problem. We're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space. In fact  we've regressed. We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done. And that is  instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places  went to more hostile places  and found out later  maybe to our surprise  that that's the reason we survived. And I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it. They need to look forward to exploration  they need to look forward to colonization  they need to look forward to breakthroughs. We need to inspire them  because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future. I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine to    for this next decade and a half    oh shoot  I screwed up. We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics. What we're looking forward to is    what we're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children  but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country    the Boeing's and Lockheed's space engineers    to go out and take risks and try new stuff. We're going to go back to the moon ...    years later  And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new. I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's    the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today  though  is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later. That's the theme of my next    minutes here. And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young  three year olds  up to         year olds. What they look at is the most important thing. Let's take a snapshot at aviation. And there was a wonderful little short four year time period when marvelous things happened. It started in       when the Wright brothers flew in Paris  and everybody said   Ooh  hey  I can do that.  There's only a few people that have flown in early     . In four years     countries had hundreds of airplanes  thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection. Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today  but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. There were probably at least        different things tried  and when they crash and kill the pilot  don't try that again. The ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition. So we  by making a whole bunch of attempts  thousands of attempts  in that four year time period  we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe  as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good. That has not happened at all in space flying. There's only been two concepts tried    two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. Well  who was inspired during that time period  Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first     years of aviation. And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation. Well  what happened when I was a little kid was    some pretty heavy stuff too. The jet age started  the missile age started. Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars    and this was before Sputnik. And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there  we knew there were plants there  the colors change  right  But  you know  NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the deserts. If you look at what happened    this little black line is as fast as man ever flew  and the red line is top of the line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport. You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid    and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try. Well  what did I do when I was a kid  I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and  well  we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes. I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War flight testing airplanes for the Air Force. And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages. And some       of those are flying. Of course  one of them is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '    which is my company now. And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since     . And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. The most impressive airplane ever  I believe  was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly  taken out of service. We retreated in '   back to something that was developed in '  . What  The most impressive spaceship ever  I believe  was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a    you know  it landed on the moon  take off of the moon  didn't need any maintenance guys    that's kind of cool. We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '  . This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in     . Three years  and we can't do that now. Crazy. Talk very briefly about innovation cycles  things that grow  have a lot of activity  they die out when they're replaced by something else. These things tend to happen every    years.    years long  with an overlap. You can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing    by the way  the speed here  excuse me  higher speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here. These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC  that was done in     . Here's the biggie  and that is  you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it. You know  a good example  of course  is the DARPA net. Computers were used for artillery first  then IRS. But when we got it  now you have all the level of activity  all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it. Keep that in mind. I put down innovation    I've looked for innovation cycles in space  I found none. The very first year  starting when Gagarin went in space  and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd  there were five manned space flights in the world    the very first year. In       everyone that the United States sent to space was killed. There were only three or four flights in     . In       there were only two flights  two Russian Soyuz flights to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five  which was the number the same year back in     . There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing. This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne. This is a picture here taken from orbit. Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that. We know how to do it for sub orbital flying now  do it safe enough    at least as safe as the early airlines    so that can be done. And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company. Well  first of all  what's going to happen next  The first industry will be a high volume  a lot of players. There's another one announced just last week. And it will be sub orbital. And the reason it has to be sub orbital is  there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this    three governments have been doing this for    years  and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died. That's    You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. It'll be very high volume  we think         people will fly by     . I can't tell you when this will start  because I don't want my competition to know my schedule. But I think once it does  we will find solutions  and very quickly  you'll see those resort hotels in orbit. And that real easy thing to do  which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool. Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere    you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by    feet if you want. Oh  it's going to be so much fun. OK. My critics say   Hey  Rutan's just spending a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires. What's this  This is not a transportation system  it's just for fun.  And I used to be bothered by that  and then I got to thinking  well  wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in      and I bought it because I could say   I got a computer at my house and you don't. 'What do you use it for ' Come over. It does Frogger.  OK. Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer  but the home computer was for games. For a whole decade it was for fun    we didn't even know what it was for. But what happened  the fact that we had this big industry  big development  big improvement and capability and so on  and they get out there in enough homes    we were ripe for a new invention. And the inventor is in this audience. Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that  something that we used for a whole year    excuse me    a whole decade for fun  became everything    our commerce  our research  our communication and  if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends  we can add a dozen more things to the list.  Laughter  And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our homes. So fun is defendable. OK  I want to show you kind of a busy chart  but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen. And in it also brings up another point  right here. There's a group of people that have come forward    and you don't know all of them    but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children  this little three  to    year old age  by us going to orbit and going to the moon here  right in this time period. Paul Allen  Elan Musk  Richard Branson  Jeff Bezos  the Ansari family  which is now funding the Russians' sub orbital thing  Bob Bigelow  a private space station  and Carmack. These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area  and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something    but they're putting it in very    areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability  and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that. There were a couple of examples here. The military fighters had a    highest performance military airplane was the SR  . It went a whole life cycle  got too rusty to fly  and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel. It went a whole life cycle without competition  took out of service. And we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '  s. But something is out there to inspire our kids now. And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now  or if you've got a    year old now. What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. Relatively soon  you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplane. It's never happened before. The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been  well  you know  you win the war in    minutes  why do you need something better  But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub orbital flights to space  very soon    wait a minute  what's happening here  we'll have military fighters with sub orbital capability  and I think very soon this. But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first. OK  I look forward to a new  capitalist's space race   let's call it. You remember the space race in the '  s was for national prestige  because we lost the first two milestones. We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it    you can argue that's not a technical loss. Sputnik wasn't a technical loss  but it was a prestige loss. America    the world saw America as not being the leader in technology  and that was a very strong thing. And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin  not months or decades  or whatever. So we had the capability. But America lost. We lost. And because of that  we made a big jump to recover it. Well  again  what's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already. You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America    can't do it. You can buy it in Russia. You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available because a Russian space program is starving  and it's nice for them to get    million here and there to take one of the seats. It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon  like Apollo   was done.     million bucks    hey  I can go to the moon. But  you know  would you have thought back in the '  s  when the space race was going on  that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware  And would you have thought  would the Russians have thought  that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware  the guys inside won't be Russians  Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire  Well  that's weird  you know  it really is. But anyway  I think we need to beat them again. I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful  very successful  private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter. The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde. And then they flew a few cargo flights  and took it out of service. I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered. OK  we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight. This little thing says here  five times what NASA's doing by     . I want to tell you  already there's about  .  billion to  .  billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all    already  worldwide. If you read    if you Google it  you'll find about half of that money  but there's twice of that being committed out there    not spent yet  but being committed and planned for the next few years. Hey  that's pretty big. I'm predicting  though  as profitable as this industry is going to be    and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at         dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost  or less    this is going to be very profitable. I predict  also  that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work. And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of    to   . And what that means is before we know it  the progress in human space flight  with no taxpayer dollars  will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight. And that is because it's us. It's private industry. You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff    and we've done it for a long time. The NACA  before NASA  never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. But NASA is developing the space liner  always has  and runs the only space line  OK. And we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of       when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it  can get a start with it  everything changed after that time. OK  thank you very much. This is me. My name is Ben Saunders. I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places. On May   th last year  I stood alone at the North geographic Pole. I was the only human being in an area one and a half times the size of America  five and a half thousand square miles. More than       people have climbed Everest.    people have stood on the moon. Including me  only four people have skied solo to the North Pole. And I think the reason for that       thank you    I think the reason for that is that it's    it's    well  it's as Chris said  bonkers. It's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability. I skied the equivalent of    marathons back to back.     miles in    weeks. And I was dragging all the food I needed  the supplies  the equipment  sleeping bag  one change of underwear    everything I needed for nearly three months. What we're going to try and do today  in the    and a bit minutes I've got left  is to try and answer three questions. The first one is  why  The second one is  how do you go to the loo at minus      Ben  I've read somewhere that at minus     exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute  so how do you answer the call of nature   I don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end. Third one  how do you top that  What's next  It all started back in     . My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow    enormously experienced chap. This was like my polar apprenticeship. We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here  Severnaya Zemlya  to the North Pole. And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole  geographic North Pole  is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea. This is about as good as maps get  and to reach it you've got to ski literally over the frozen crust  the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean. I'd spoken to all the experts. I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts. But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I'd let myself in for. I was    years old. No one my age had attempted anything like this  and pretty quickly  almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong. We were attacked by a polar bear on day two. I had frostbite in my left big toe. We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry  losing lots of weight. Some very unusual weather conditions  very difficult ice conditions. We had decidedly low tech communications. We couldn't afford a satellite phone  so we had HF radio. You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent. There's a wire dangling down either side. That was our HF radio antenna. We had less than two hours two way communication with the outside world in two months. Ultimately  we ran out of time. We'd skied     miles. We were just over     miles left to go to the Pole  and we'd run out of time. We were too late into the summer  the ice was starting to melt  we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio  and they said   Look boys  you've run out of time. We've got to pick you up.  And I felt that I had failed  wholeheartedly. I was a failure. The one goal  the one dream I'd had for as long as I could remember    I hadn't even come close. And skiing along that first trip  I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough  just to keep my motivation going. The first one was reaching the Pole itself. I could see vividly  I suppose  being filmed out of the door of a helicopter  there was  kind of  rock music playing in the background  and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack  you know  flying in the wind. I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole  you know    ah  glorious moment    the music kind of reaching a crescendo. The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport  and I could see again  vividly  the camera flashbulbs going off  the paparazzi  the autograph hunters  the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal. And of course  neither of these things happened. We didn't get to the Pole  and we didn't have any money to pay anyone to do the PR  so no one had heard of this expedition. And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there  my brother was there  my granddad was there    had a little Union Jack       and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum. I was physically exhausted  mentally an absolute wreck  considered myself a failure. In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition  and lying on my mum's sofa  day in day out  watching daytime TV. My brother sent me a text message  an SMS    it was a quote from the  Simpsons.  It said   You tried your hardest and failed miserably. The lesson is  don't even try.  Fast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa  and start planning another expedition. This time  I wanted to go right across  on my own this time  from Russia  at the top of the map  to the North Pole  where the sort of kink in the middle is  and then on to Canada. No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own. Two Norwegians did it as a team in     . No one's done it solo. Very famous  very accomplished Italian mountaineer  Reinhold Messner  tried it in       and he was rescued after a week. He described this expedition as    times as dangerous as Everest. So for some reason  this was what I wanted to have a crack at  but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece  let alone make it across to Canada  I had to take a radical approach. This meant everything from perfecting the sawn off  sub two gram toothbrush  to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists in developing a completely new  revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch        calories a day. And the expedition started in February last year. Big support team. We had a film crew  a couple of logistics people with us  my girlfriend  a photographer. At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow. The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk  on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir  spelled K R A S. The next bit  we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga  which was the sort of last bit of civilization. Our cameraman  who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times  actually asked the pilot  before we got on the plane  how long this flight would take  and the pilot    Russian pilot    completely deadpan  replied   Six hours    if we live.  We got to Khatanga. I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world  but you can see it from there. It was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for    days. There was a kind of vodka fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter  so we were stuck. We couldn't move. Finally  morning of day     we got the all clear  loaded up the helicopters    two helicopters flying in tandem    dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice. We had a frantic sort of    minutes of filming  photography  while the helicopter was still there  I did an interview on the satellite phone  and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter  wham  the door closed  and I was alone. And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice. All I could think about was running back up to the door  banging on the door  and saying   Look guys  I haven't quite thought this through.  To make things worse  you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen  that's a full moon. Because we'd been held up in Russia  of course  the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides  when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea  high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen    the ice is going to start moving around a bit. I was  you can see there  pulling two sledges. Grand total in all     days of food and fuel      kilos    that's almost exactly     pounds. When the ice was flat or flattish  I could just about pull both. When the ice wasn't flat  I didn't have a hope in hell. I had to pull one  leave it  and go back and get the other one. Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice    the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean  the wind and the tides. NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began. And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting. I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the    weeks I was alone last year  and I was drifting backwards most of the time. My record was minus  .  miles. I got up in the morning  took the tent down  skied north for seven and a half hours  put the tent up  and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started. I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice. I'm lying in the tent  getting ready to go. The weather is just appalling    oh  drifted back about five miles in the last    last night. Later in the expedition  the problem was no longer the ice. It was a lack of ice    open water. I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming. I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve. This was my little bit of bio mimicry. Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines. If they come to water  they'll climb in  swim across it. So we had a dry suit developed    I worked with a team in Norway    based on a sort of survival suit    I suppose  that helicopter pilots would wear    that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots  over my mittens  it would pull up around my face   and seal pretty tightly around my face. And this meant I could ski over very thin ice  and if I fell through  it wasn't the end of the world. It also meant  if the worst came to the worst  I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me. Some pretty radical technology  a radical approach   but it worked perfectly. Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology. In       Shackleton's Endurance expedition    there was    one of his crew  a guy called Thomas Orde Lees. He said   The explorers of       if there is anything left to explore  will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes.  Well  Orde Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone  Iridium satellite phone. The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket. And every single day of the    days I was alone on the ice  I was blogging live from my tent  sending back a little diary piece  sending back information on the distance I'd covered    the ice conditions  the temperature    and a daily photo. Remember        we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world. Last year  blogging live from an expedition that's been described as    times as dangerous as Everest. It wasn't all high tech. This is navigating in what's called a whiteout. When you get lots of mist  low cloud  the wind starts blowing the snow up. You can't see an awful lot. You can just see  there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles. I'd navigate using the direction of the wind. So  kind of a weird combination of high tech and low tech. I got to the Pole on the   th of May. It took me    days to get there from Russia  and there is nothing there. There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there  purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting. Stick a flag there  leave it there  pretty soon it will drift off  usually towards Canada or Greenland. I knew this  but I was expecting something. Strange mixture of feelings  it was extremely warm by this stage  a lot of open water around  and of course  elated that I'd got there under my own steam  but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada  which was still     miles away  were slim at best. The only proof I've got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS  the little satellite navigation gadget. You can just see    there's a nine and a string of zeros here. Ninety degrees north    that is slap bang in the North Pole. I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece. Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out. I warmed the battery up in my armpit. I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum. I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor. And I got three voicemails. It's a special feeling. The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet. The    the whole world underneath me. I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket. She started crying. She asked me to call her back. I skied on for a week past the Pole. I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue. This was the last day I had on the ice. When I spoke to the    my project management team  they said   Look  Ben  conditions are getting too dangerous. There are huge areas of open water just south of your position. We'd like to pick you up. Ben  could you please look for an airstrip   This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call. I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony  the expedition manager  he said   Look Ben  you've got to find     meters of flat  thick safe ice.  The only bit of ice I could find    it took me    hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip    was exactly     meters. I could measure it with my skis. I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that. I thought  it'll have to do. It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing    the plane actually passed over four times  and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all. The pilot  I knew  was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy. I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed    a pretty emotional moment. So I thought  I've got to compose myself for Troy. I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type. The plane taxied up to where I was standing. The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said   Hi  my name is Troy.  The co pilot was a lady called Monica. She sat there in a sort of hand knitted jumper. They were the least macho people I've ever met  but they made my day. Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice  we took a few photos. He climbed up the ladder. He said   Just    just get in the back.  He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front  and I climbed in the back. Taxied up and down the runway a few times  just to flatten it out a bit  and he said   Right  I'm going to    I'm going to give it a go.  And he    I've now learned that this is standard practice  but it had me worried at the time. He put his hand on the throttle. You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit. It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle. Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his. I thought   God  here we go. We're  we're    this is all or nothing.  Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off. One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway  banking. I could see into the cockpit  Troy battling the controls  and he just took one hand off  reached back  flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit  and it was the  fasten seat belt  sign you can see on the wall. And only from the air did I see the big picture. Of course  when you're on the ice  you only ever see one obstacle at a time  whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water. This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip. I mean  it really was starting to break up. Why  I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense. I'm not skiing along drawing maps  everyone knows where the North Pole is. At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip. There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop. For me  this is about exploring human limits  about exploring the limits of physiology  of psychology and of technology. They're the things that excite me. And it's also about potential  on a personal level. This  for me  is a chance to explore the limits    really push the limits of my own potential  see how far they stretch. And on a wider scale  it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential  just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of. So  on a wider scale  I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential  and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet. That's as close as I can come to summing that up. The next question is  how do you answer the call of nature at minus     The answer  of course  to which is a trade secret    and the last question  what's next  As quickly as possible  if I have a minute left at the end  I'll go into more detail. What's next  Antarctica. It's the coldest  highest  windiest and driest continent on Earth. Late       early       there was a race to be the first to the South Pole  the heart of the Antarctic continent. If you include the coastal ice shelves  you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf    it's the big one down here    the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France. Antarctica  if you include the ice shelves  is twice the size of Australia    it's a big place. And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen  the Norwegian    Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies    and Scott  the British guy  Captain Scott. Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs  all of which went wrong  and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot. They got to the Pole late January      to find a Norwegian flag already there. There was a tent  a letter to the Norwegian king. And they turned around  headed back to the coast  and all five of them died on the return journey. Since then  no one has ever skied    this was    years ago    since then  no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back. Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing    no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan. Two of us are doing it. That's pretty much it. One final thought before I get to the toilet bit  is    is  I have a    and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten    but I have a    I have a school report. I was    years old  and it's framed above my desk at home. It says   Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile.  I think if I've learned anything  it's this  that no one else is the authority on your potential. You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of. Ladies and gentlemen  that's my story. Thank you very much. Walk around for four months with three wishes  and all the ideas will start to percolate up. I think everybody should do it    think that you've got three wishes. And what would you do  It's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important  and really reflect on the world around us. And thinking that  can an individual actually do something  or come up with something  that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference  Inspired by nature    that's the theme here. And I think  quite frankly  that's where I started. I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian. We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population  and my father was an avid outdoorsman. So I really had a chance to experience that. And I could never really understand exactly what it was  or how it was informing me. But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening  and that the nature that you see out there    the untouched shorelines  the untouched forest that I was able to see    really bring in a sense of that geological time  that this has gone on for a long time  and we're experiencing it in a different way. And that  to me  was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did. And I did go out  and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring  along a roadside. This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape. But as a fine art photographer I somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there  that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine art career. And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture  or something of that nature  and I couldn't get away from it. So I started to think of  how can I rethink the landscape  I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we've transformed. I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania  and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway. And I ended up in a town called Frackville. I got out of the car  and I stood up  and it was a coal mining town. I did a     turnaround  and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen. Totally transformed by man. And that got me to go out and look at mines like this  and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find. And that became the baseline of what I was doing. And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto  and not have to re invent myself    that this theme was large enough to become a life's work  to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are. And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks  which I kind of missed  was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in. Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs    to get into that place to make those photographs  and if it wasn't for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations  I would have never made this body of work. So in that respect  to me  I'm not against the corporation. I own a corporation. I work with them  and I feel that we all need them and they're important. But I am also for sustainability. So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions. And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here  but it is a slow progression. So I started thinking  well  we live in all these ages of man  the Stone Age  and the Iron Age  and the Copper Age. And these ages of man are still at work today. But we've become totally disconnected from them. There's something that we're not seeing there. And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles  and what we're doing to that landscape    that  to me  is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate. And through my photographs  I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work  and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image. Not to say   Oh my God  what is it   but to be challenged by it    to say   Wow  this is beautiful   on one level  but on the other level   This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it.  Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there  and it gets people to look at these things  and it gets people to enter it. And it also  in a way  defines kind of what I feel  too    that I'm drawn to have a good life. I want a house  and I want a car. But there's this consequence out there. And how do I begin to have that attraction  repulsion  It's even in my own conscience I'm having it  and here in my work  I'm trying to build that same toggle. These things that I photographed    this tire pile here had    million tires in it. It was the largest one. It was only about an hour and a half away from me  and it caught fire about four years ago. It's around Westley  California  around Modesto. And I decided to start looking at something that  to me  had    if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature  in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction. To me  it was our redemption. That in the recycling work that I was doing  I'm looking for a practice  a human activity that is sustainable. That if we keep putting things  through industrial and urban existence  back into the system    if we keep doing that    we can continue on. Of course  listening at the conference  there's many  many things that are coming. Bio mimicry  and there's many other things that are coming on stream    nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart. And we all look forward to those things. But in the meantime  these things are scaling up. These things are continuing to happen. What you're looking at here    I went to Bangladesh  so I started to move away from North America  I started to look at our world globally. These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to. They were talking about Exxon Valdez  and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries. And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned  and      was going to be the pinnacle. And I thought   My God  wouldn't that be something   To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand  literally  in third world countries. So originally I was going to go to India. And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there  and then I was able to get into Bangladesh  and saw for the first time a third world  a view of it  that I had never actually thought was possible.     million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin    people everywhere    the pollution was intense  and the working conditions were horrible. Here you're looking at some oil fields in California  some of the biggest oil fields. And again  I started to think that    there was another epiphany    that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil. And that  to me  was again something that I started building on  and I continued to build on. So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years  under the heading of  The Oil Party.  Because I think everything that we're involved in    our clothing  our cars  our roads  and everything    are directly a result. I'm going to move to some pictures of China. And for me China    I started photographing it four years ago  and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind  not to mention that China  as well  has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around. I came out of a blue collar town  a GM town  and my father worked at GM  so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work. But you know  to see China and the scale at which it's evolving  is quite something. So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam  and this is the largest dam by    percent ever attempted by man. Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said   It's just too big.  In fact  when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago  they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning. It took fifteen days to fill it. So this created a reservoir     kilometers long  one of the largest reservoirs ever created. And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving    full size cities up out of the reservoir  and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships. This is a  before and after.  So that was before. And this is like    weeks later  demolished by hand. I think    of the buildings they used dynamite  everything else was by hand. That was    weeks later. And this gives you an idea. And it was all the people who lived in those homes  were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working  and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart. And these are some of the images from that. So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam  looking at that massive transformation of a landscape. And it looks like a bombed out landscape  but it isn't. What it is  it's a landscape that is an intentional one. This is a need for power  and they're willing to go through this massive transformation  on this scale  to get that power. And again  it's actually a relief for what's going on in China because I think on the table right now  there's    nuclear power stations to be built. There hasn't been one built in North America for    years because of the  NIMBY  problem     Not In My BackYard.  But in China they're saying   No  we're putting in    in the next    years.  And coal burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly. So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems. And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges    a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost  some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that. And  .  to   million people were relocated  depending on whose statistics you're looking at. And this is what they were building. This is Wushan  one of the largest cities that was relocated. This is the town hall for the city. And again  the rebuilding of the city    to me  it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of  I guess  what we know here  in terms of urban planning. There were no parks  there were no green spaces. Very high density living on the side of a hill. And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up  but somehow were not connecting with them. Here is a sign that  translated  says   Obey the birth control law. Build our science  civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth.  So here  if you look at this poster  it has all the trappings of Western culture. You're seeing the tuxedos  the bouquets. But what's really  to me  frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background. So it's like marrying up all the things that we have and it's an adaptation of our way of life  full stop. And again  when you start seeing that kind of embrace  and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very  very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint  it starts to become very sobering. This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong    and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country. And there's about     million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times  and in the next    to    years  are expecting another     to     million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers. The manufacturers are    the domestics are usually    you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms. So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory. And they have dorms for the workers. So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms. This is one of the biggest shoe factories  the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen. It has        employees making shoes. This is a shift change  one of three. There's two factories of this scale in the same town. This is one with         so every lunch  there's about        coming through for lunch. They sit down  they have about    minutes. The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce that's building there. Shanghai    I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai  and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years. What's also happening in Shanghai is    China is changing because this wouldn't have happened five years ago  for instance. This is a holdout. They're called dengzahoos    they're like pin tacks to the ground. They won't move. They're not negotiating. They're not getting enough  so they're not going to move. And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them. And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal. They're being put out about two hours    the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years  or maybe even thousands of years  are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai. Probably the largest urban renewal project  I think  ever attempted on the planet. And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with    again  one of my wishes  and I never ended up going there  was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house. The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something  and these are called the villas. And also  like right now  they're just moving. The scaffolding is still on  and this is an e waste area  and if you looked in the foreground on the big print  you'd see that the industry    their industry    they're all recycling. So the industry's already growing around these new developments. This is a five level bridge in Shanghai. Shanghai was a very intriguing city    it's exploding on a level that I don't think any city has experienced. In fact  even Shenzhen  the economic zone    one of the first ones       years ago was about         people  and today it boasts about    to    million. So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which    this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen. There's       of them here  and they're being built for most of the big cities  Beijing and Shanghai  Shenzhen. And this isn't even the domestic car market  this is the taxi market. And what we would see here as a suburban development    a similar thing  but they're all high rises. So they'll put    or    up at a time  and they just go up in the same way as a single family dwelling would go up here in an area. And the density is quite incredible. And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings  I was shocked to see that they're not using a central air conditioning system  every window has an air conditioner in it. And I'm sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies  but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale. And when you start looking at that  and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai  it's literally a forest of skyscrapers. It's breathtaking  in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming. And you can see in the foreground of this picture  it's still one of the last areas that was being held up. Right now that's all cleared out    this was done about eight months ago    and high rises are now going up into that central spot. So a skyscraper is built  literally  overnight in Shanghai. Most recently I went in  and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China. And this is Baosteel  right outside of Shanghai. This is the coal supply for the steel factory       square kilometers. It's an incredibly massive operation  I think        workers  five cupolas  and the sixth one's coming in here. So they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China. So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot. And again  looking at these images  there's this constant  like  haze that you're seeing. This is going to show you  real time  an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.    hours a day at this speed. I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China  is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology. In that one  there were     people that worked on the floor. And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers  and then I went and looked at each one of them for about    or    minutes  and picked this one woman. And it was just lightning fast  the way she was working was almost unbelievable. But that is the trick that they've got right now  that they're winning with  is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines  and bringing all the components into play  but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in    the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work. There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs. That condition's going to be there for the next    to    years if they realize what they want  which is  you know      to     million more people coming into the cities. In this particular case    this is the assembly line that you saw  this is a shot of it. I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field. I had to have them freeze for    seconds to get this shot. It took me five fake tries because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible. They were just wound up doing these things all day long  until the manager had to  with a stern voice  say   Okay  everybody freeze.  It wasn't too bad  but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate. This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk  an oil byproduct. And what you're seeing here is  again  one of the most state of the art textile mills. There are     of these machines  they're worth about         dollars each. So you have about    people running this  and they're just inspecting it    and they're just walking the lines. The machines are all running  absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are. And I started getting in further and further into the factories. And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places. This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together  pre going into the textile mills. Here's something that's far more labor intensive  which is the making of shoes. This floor has about       workers on this floor. The company itself had about        employees  and they're doing domestic shoes. It was very hard to get into the international companies because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas  and that's very hard to get. And they don't want to let me in. But the domestic was much easier to do. It just gives you a sense of  again    and that's where  really  the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones. It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market. This is a high tech mobile phone  Bird mobile phone  one of the largest mobile makers in China. I think mobile phone companies are popping up  literally  on a weekly basis  and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones. This is a textile where they're doing shirts    Youngor  the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China. And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms. Everything is very efficient. While setting up this shot  people on average would spend eight to    minutes having a lunch. This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen. They make coffeemakers here  the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers    they make    million of them in the world. There's        employees. This one factory    and they had several of them    is half a kilometer long. These are just recently shot    I just came back about a month ago  so you're the first ones to be seeing these  these new factory pictures I've taken. So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places. The other aspect of what's happening in China is that there's a real need for materials there. So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships. That's cubed metal. This is armatures  electrical armatures  where they're getting the copper and the high end steel from electrical motors out  and recycling them. This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley. But this is what happens to most of the computers. Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled. It's referred to as  e waste  there. And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes  which are used all through China  but they heat up the boards  and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components. They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components. But the toxic smells    when you come into a town that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards  you can smell it a good five or    kilometers before you get there. Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries  so it's not big places    it's all in people's front porches  in their backyards  even in their homes they're burning boards  if there's a concern for somebody coming by    because it is considered in China to be illegal  doing it  but they can't stop the product from coming in. This portrait    I'm not usually known for portraits  but I couldn't resist this one  where she's been through Mao  and she's been through the Great Leap Forward  and the Cultural Revolution  and now she's sitting on her porch with this e waste beside her. It's quite something. This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling. So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you. I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls. They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking. One's Megan  the one of the right  and Katja there. And to me the whole notion    the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress. And as much as there are great things around the corner    and it's palpable in this room    of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems  I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect. And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world  but it starts to go up    because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down    but there's a growing footprint that's happening in Asia  and is growing at a rapid  rapid rate  and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy  I think  here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution  because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well. So part of my thinking  and part of my wishes  is sitting with these thoughts in mind  and thinking about   How is their life going to be when they want to have children  or when they're ready to get married    years from now    or whatever     years from now   And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking    in my work  and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes. Wish one  world changing. I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability. And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea. Oh  and I went in search    I wanted to put what I had in mind  hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere. One of them I'm starting from almost nothing  but the other one  I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now. And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog  and that blog is now being visited by close to half a million people a month. And it just started about    months ago. And the beauty of what's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like. What they're doing there is that they're not    I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much  it's used the apocalyptic tone too much  it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out. Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements  about how to change our world in a better way  quickly. And it's looking at technology  and it's looking at new energy saving devices  and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re strategize the movement towards sustainability. And so for me  one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchanging.com website. Some of you might know  he's a TEDster    Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages  these aren't the finals. But these images  with Worldchanging.com  can be placed into any kind of media. They could be posted through the Web  they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter  or anything of that nature. So we're looking at this as trying to build out. And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text  and the text is blasted all over. What was unusual  according to Stephen  is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image. And so in this case  because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent  and the kinds of questions they bring up  that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say   Well  what's Worldchanging.com  with these images  have to do   And hopefully inspire people to go to that website. So Worldchanging.com  and building that blog  and it is a blog  and I'm hoping that it isn't    I don't see it as the kind of blog where we're all going to follow each other to death. This one is one that will spoke out  and will go out  and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations in India  in China  in South America    there's entries coming from all around the world. I think there's a chance to have a dialogue  a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com. And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic. Wish two is more of the bottom up  ground up one that I'm trying to work with. And this one is  I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on  and invent ideas on  sustainability. And one of the things that came out    Allison  who actually nominated me  said something earlier on in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six. And you think about it  you know  grade four    my wife and I  we say age seven is the age of reason  so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre puberty. So it's this great window where they actually are    you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty  You know  we know that from earlier presentations. So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is  and that they have a vested interest in it to happen. And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize  so I would take        or        dollars of the winnings  and the rest is going to be to manage this project  but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands. But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these    call them  prize targets.  And so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in school project  the best one for a household project  or it could be the best community project for sustainability. And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for  In My World.  And what would happen    it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things    whether it's equipment  like a media lab  or money to make the prize significant enough    and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools  or schools that are with kids that age  and make it a wide open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them. And the prize has to be a verifiable thing  so it's not about just ideas. The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them  but the actual things have to be verifiable. In that way  what's happening is that we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking. And they're going to push that up  from the bottom    up into  I believe  into the households. And parents will be reacting to it  and trying to help them with the projects. And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way  and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now  but they don't really  I think  get sustainability in all the things  and the energy footprint  and how that matters. And to teach them  to me  would be a fantastic wish  and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into. And again  in  In My World   the competition    we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it. And I like the words   in my world   because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it. It is my world  it's not someone else's. I want to help it  I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations    and great ideas  I think  come from kids    and engage their imagination into a project  and do something for schools. I think all schools could use extra equipment  extra cash    it's going to be an incentive for them to do that. And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for  In My World.  And wish three is  Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself  and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something. And the scale of my work  and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with    when I first saw an Imax film  I almost immediately thought   There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer.  And I think there's a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance. So I'm looking  really  for a mentor  because I just had my birthday. I'm     and I don't have time to go back to school right now    I'm too busy. So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catch up course on how to do something like that  and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this. That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes. I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions that can have an effect on    to a     million people  which we will hope to see happen. We discussed  in the prior film  some of the old things that we did  like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic. And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people. At the present time  it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient  before that patient arrives at an emergency room. And people with silent ischemia    which  translated into English  means they don't have any symptoms    it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital. The AMI  Acute Myocardial Infarction  which is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money       means a heart attack. Annual incidence   .  million Americans. Mortality          people dying each year. About half of them           have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on. Thus         people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle. Symptoms are often denied by the patient  particularly us men  because we are very brave. We are very brave  and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain. Then  approximately    percent of all patients never have any symptoms. What are we going to do about them  How can we save their lives  It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women. Well  what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack  A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery. That  ladies and gentlemen  is a heart attack. The means consist of noting something a little technical  ST segment elevation of the electrogram    translated into English  that means that if there's an electrical signal in the heart  and one part of the ECG    which we call the ST segment    elevates  that is a sure sign of a heart attack. And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk  we could know  before they even have symptoms  that they're having a heart attack  to save their life. Well  the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm  vibration like your cell phone  but right by your clavicle bone. And when it goes beep  beep  beep  you better do something about it  because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment. So we have to try these devices out because the FDA won't just let us use them on people unless we try it out first  and the best model for this happens to be pigs. And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin  like you see in an emergency room  and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well. And then we put a lead  which is a wire  in the right ventricle inside the heart  which does the electrogram  which is the signal voltage from inside the heart. Well  with the pig  at the baseline  before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack  that was the signal. After    seconds  even an expert couldn't tell the difference  and after three minutes    well  if you really studied it  you'd see a difference. But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart  to the electrogram  There was the baseline    first of all  a much bigger and more reliable signal. Second of all  I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference  and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line. Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much    every layperson could see that difference  and computers can be programmed to easily detect it. Then  look at that after three minutes. We see that the signal that's actually in the heart  we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life. Then we tried it with my son  Dr. Tim Fischell  we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in. Well  he kept the balloon filled to block the artery  to simulate a blockage  which is what a heart attack is. And it's not hard to see that    the baseline is the first picture on the upper left. Next to it  at    seconds  you see this rise here  then this rise    that's the ST elevation. And if we had a computer that could detect it  we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure. And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see  even after    seconds  a great rise in this piece  which we can have computers inside  under your chest like a pacemaker  with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker. And computers don't go to sleep. We have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement. What does the system look like  Well  on the left is the IMD  which is Implantable Medical Device  and tonight in the tent you can see it    they've exhibited it. It's about this big  the size of a pacemaker. It's implanted with very conventional techniques. And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table. It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because  if you don't  you're in deep doo doo. And then  finally  a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation  which is the level which says you are having a heart attack. The FDA says  OK  test this final device after it's built in some animal  which we said is a pig  so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack. And when you go to the farmyard  you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks  so we said  well  we're experts in stents. Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents. We said  so we'll put in a stent  but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people. We're putting in a copper stent  and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks. That's not very nice  but  after all  we had to find out what the answer is. So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig  and let me show you the result that's very gratifying as far as people who have heart disease are concerned. So there it was  Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication and there is his electrogram  the signal from inside the pig's heart coming out by radio telemetry. Then  on Friday at       he began to get certain signs  which later we had the pig run around    I'm not going to go into this early stage. But look what happened at       after we removed this pig's medication that kept him from having a heart attack. Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there  Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS    you see ST elevation  This pig at       was having a heart attack. What happens after you have the heart attack  this blockage  Your rhythm becomes irregular  and that's what happened    minutes later. Then  ventricular fibrillation  the heart quivers instead of beats    this is just before death of the pig    and then the pig died  it went flat line. But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life. Well  because of the FDA  we didn't save the pig's life  because we need to do this type of animal research for humans. But when it comes to the sake of a human  we can save their life. We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack. What is the response to acute myocardial infarction  a heart attack  today  Well  you feel some chest pain or indigestion. It's not all that bad  you decide not to do anything. Several hours pass and it gets worse  and even the man won't ignore it. Finally  you go to the emergency room. You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated  because    percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don't have AMI  so you're not taken very seriously. They finally see you. It takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it  and it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data  which the computer we put in you gets. Finally  if you're lucky  you are treated in three or four hours after the incident  but the heart muscle has died. And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world    not Africa    that's the typical treatment in the advanced world today. So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient  called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian. And when you have a blockage  the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device  which gets your baseline electrogram from    hours ago and the one that caused the alarm  so you can take it to the emergency room and show them  and say  take care of me right away. Then it goes to a network operations center  where they get your data from your patient database that's been put in at some central location  say  in the United States. Then it goes to a diagnostic center  and within one minute of your heart attack  your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is. And the person who's there  the medical practitioner  calls you    this is also a cell phone    and says   Mr. Smith  you're in deep doo doo  you have a problem. We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way. It'll pick you up  and then we're going to call your doctor  tell him about it. We're going to send him the signal that we have  that says you have a heart attack  and we're going to send the signal to the hospital and we're going to have it analyzed there  and there you're going to be with your doctor and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack.  That's the first invention that I wanted to describe. And now I want to talk about something entirely different. At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem because I'd never had a migraine headache  but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life  and their lives are being totally ruined by it. We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine  which is   Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches by the application of a safe  controlled magnetic pulse applied  as needed  by the patient.  Now  you're probably very few physicists here. If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law  which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water    that's your brains by the way    it'll generate electric currents  and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache. That's what we have discovered. So here's a picture of what we're doing. The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons    that's shown in red    that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid brain. And when it hits the mid brain  that's when the headache begins. There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura  and this visual aura  by the way    and I'll show you a picture    but it sort of begins with little dancing lights  gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field. And what we tried was this  here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES  . Weighs about    pounds  has a wire about an inch in diameter. And here's one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache  bad one  after the aura. What do we do  This is what an aura looks like. It's sort of funny dancing lights  shown there on the left and right side. And that's a fully developed visual aura  as we see on top. In the middle  our experimentalist  the neurologist  who said   I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura.  And  by God  the neurologist did erase it  and that's the middle picture  half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse. What does that mean  That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain. And finally he says   OK  now I'm going to      all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse. What is the result  We designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this  that you could have    a lady  in her pocket book    and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works. Well  the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News  Channel    last week in New York City  in the    o'clock news. Anchor  For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches    and there are    million Americans who do    tonight  a possible answer. Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight  with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away. Christina Sidebottom  Well  my first reaction was that it was    looked awfully gun like  and it was very strange. Stacy Sager  But for Christina Sidebottom  almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine. It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse  but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper  say it is scientifically sound    that  in fact  when the average person gets a migraine  it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse. The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that. Yousef Mohammed  In other words  we're treating electricity with electricity  rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays. SS  But is it safe to use everyday  Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade  and more long term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it. CS  It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine. SS  Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer. Robert Fischell  And that is the invention to treat migraines. You see  the problem is     million Americans have migraine headaches  and we need a means to treat it  and I think that we now have it. And this is the first device that we did  and I'm going to talk about my second wish  which has something to do with this. Our conclusions from our studies so far  at three research centers  is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once. The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times  and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches  not only those with aura  get treated and get diminished. And auras can be erased and the migraine  then  does not occur. And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on. The third and last invention began with an idea. Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation. Now  why do we use    add on  nearly  an epileptic focus  Now  unfortunately  us technical people  unlike Mr. Bono  have to get into all these technical words. Well   responsive electrical stimulation  means that we sense  at a place in your brain which is called an  epileptic focus   which is where the epileptic seizure begins    we sense there  that it's going to happen  and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot  which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache. We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart. We thought we could adapt it for the brain. The device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage  which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around. Form a company to develop a neuro pacemaker for epilepsy  as well as other diseases of the brain  because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it  that causes many  if not all  of brain disorders. We formed a company called NeuroPace and we started work on responsive neurostimulation  and this is a picture of what the device looked like  that's placed into the cranial bone. This is probably a better picture. Here we have our device in which we put in a frame. There's a cut made in the scalp  it's opened  the neurosurgeon has a template  he marks it around  and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device. And tonight  you'll be able to see the device in the tent. And then with four screws  we put in a frame  then we snap in the device and we run with wires    the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes  to the epileptic focus  the origin of the epilepsy  where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure. In the blue wire  we see what's called a deep brain electrode. If that's the source of the epilepsy  we can attack that as well. The comprehensive solution  this is the device  it's about one inches by two inches and  oddly enough  just the thickness of most cranial bones. The advantages of responsive neurostimulation  It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur  provide stimulation only when needed  can be turned off if seizures disappear  it has minimal side effects    as a matter of fact  in all our clinical trials to date  we've seen no side effects in the    or so patients in whom it's been implanted    and it's invisible  cosmetically hidden  so  if you have epilepsy and you have the device  no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there. And this shows what an electroencephalogram is  and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients. Then we stimulated  and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal  which means they did not get the epileptic seizure. That concludes my discussion of epilepsy  which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon. I have three wishes. Well  I can't do much about Africa. I'm a tech  I'm into medical gadgetry  which is mostly high tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about. The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator  called RNS  for Responsive NeuroStimulator    that's a brilliant acronym    for the treatment of other brain disorders. Well  if we're going to do it for epilepsy  why the hell not try it for something else  Then you saw what that device looked like  that the woman was using to fix her migraines  I tell you this  that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct  not a real designer of good equipment. We want to have some people  who really know how to do this  perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches. And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations. Then we're going to challenge the TED attendees to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA  where we have problems that Africa doesn't have. And by reducing malpractice litigation    malpractice litigation is not an African problem  it's an American problem. So  to get quickly to my first wish    the brain operates by electrical signals. If the electrical signals create a brain disorder  electro stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons. In other words  if you've screwed up electrical signals  maybe  by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain  we can counteract that. A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for electro stimulation like we're doing with epilepsy. But even if there is no signal  electro stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder. And consider treating psychotic disorders    and I want this involved with the TED group    such as obsessive compulsive disorder that  presently  is not well treated with drugs  and includes five million Americans. And Mr. Fischer  and his group at NeuroPace  and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world. That is the first wish. The second wish is  at the present time  the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators    that's what TMS means  device to treat migraine headaches    appears to be quite successful. Well  that's the good news. The present portable device is far from optimally designed  both as to human factors as appearance. I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns. Engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches. And that is the second wish. And  of the         dollar prize money  that TED was so generous to give me  I am donating        dollars to the NeuroPace people to get on with the treatment of OCD  obsessive compulsive disorder  and I'm making another        available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines. And that's how I'll use my         dollar prize money. Well  the third and final wish is somewhat    unfortunately  it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers. Well  medical malpractice litigation in the US has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance  so that competent physicians are leaving their practice. Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury  because this patient really ended up badly. The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs. I've seen pictures  graphs in today's USA Today showing it skyrocketing out of control  and this is one factor. Well  how can the TED community help with this situation  I have a couple of ideas to begin with. As a starting point for discussion with the TED group  a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign. For example  I asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent. Would you believe     pages  single space  the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy  What do you think someone has at the end of reading    single spaced pages  They don't understand what the hell it's about. That's the present system. How about making a video  We have entertainment people here  we have people who know how to do videos  with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation. Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient  where they see the video and they're being videoed and they press  do you understand this  No  I don't. Well  then let's go to a simpler explanation. Then there's a simpler one and  oh yes  I understand that. Well  press the button and you're on record  you understand. And that is one of the ideas. Now  also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter  with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done  including all the possible failure modes. The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs. Now  in America  in fact  you cannot give up your right to trial by jury. However  if a video is there that everything was explained to you  and you have it all in the video file  it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency  because it won't be nearly as good a case. If a medical error occurs  the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court. That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone. These are just some starting points. And  so there  that's the end of all my wishes. I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are. Well  as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call   Hello  is that Domino's Pizza   I just really want to thank you very much. As another famous man  Jerry Garcia  said   What a strange  long trip.  And he should have said   What a strange  long trip it's about to become.  At this very moment  you are viewing my upper half. My lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country. You can  it turns out  be in two places at once. But still  I'm sorry I can't be with you in person. I'll explain at another time. And though I'm a rock star  I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub. But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP  players. The revolution    this revolution    is much bigger than that. I hope  I believe. What turns me on about the digital age  what excites me personally  is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing. You see  it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song  you needed a studio and a producer. Now  you need a laptop. If you wanted to make a film  you needed a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget. Now  you need a camera that fits in your palm  and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD. Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints. And that really  really excites me. I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large. What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints. Political  economic  psychological  whatever. The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world. From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged. And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today. First  though  I should probably explain why  and how  I got to this place. It's a journey that started    years ago. You may remember that song   We Are the World   or   Do They Know It's Christmas   Band Aid  Live Aid. Another very tall  grizzled rock star  my friend Sir Bob Geldof  issued a challenge to  feed the world.  It was a great moment  and it utterly changed my life. That summer  my wife  Ali  and myself went to Ethiopia. We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on. We lived in Ethiopia for a month  working at an orphanage. The children had a name for me. They called me   The girl with the beard.  Don't ask. Anyway  we found Africa to be a magical place. Big skies  big hearts  big  shining continent. Beautiful  royal people. Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back. Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind  it opened my mind. Anyway  on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said   Would you take my son with you   He knew  in Ireland  that his son would live  and that in Ethiopia  his son would die. It was the middle of that awful famine. Well  I turned him down. And it was a funny kind of sick feeling  but I turned him down. And it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget. And in that moment  I started this journey. In that moment  I became the worst thing of all  I became a rock star with a cause.  Laughter  Except this isn't the cause  is it  Six and a half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS    a preventable  treatable disease    for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy. That's not a cause. That's an emergency.    million AIDS orphans in Africa     million by the end of the decade. That's not a cause. That's an emergency. Today  every day        more Africans will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education. That's not a cause. That's an emergency. So what we're talking about here is human rights. The right to live like a human. The right to live  period. And what we're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality. The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is  and what this problem isn't. Because this is not all about charity. This is about justice. Really. This is not about charity. This is about justice. That's right. And that's too bad  because we're very good at charity. Americans  like Irish people  are good at it. Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford. We like to give  and we give a lot. Look at the response to the tsunami    it's inspiring. But justice is a tougher standard than charity. You see  Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. It makes a farce of our idea of equality. It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern. It questions our commitment. Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa  and if we're honest  conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else. As you heard in the film  anywhere else  not here. Not here  not in America  not in Europe. In fact  a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me. And it's really true. There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa. Africa is a continent in flames. And deep down  if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us  we would all do more to put the fire out. We're standing around with watering cans  when what we really need is the fire brigade. You see  it's not as dramatic as the tsunami. It's crazy  really  when you think about it. Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain  The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough  it would appear. Catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert. Funny  that. Anyway  I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room. Six and a half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis  but the fact that it's not on the nightly news  that we in Europe  or you in America  are not treating it like an emergency    I want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis. I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror  it could be soon. Every week  religious extremists take another African village. They're attempting to bring order to chaos. Well  why aren't we  Poverty breeds despair. We know this. Despair breeds violence. We know this. In turbulent times  isn't it cheaper  and smarter  to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later   The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty.  And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that. Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone  maybe we should listen. There's an opportunity here  and it's real. It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking. The problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re describe ourselves to the world. We will not only transform other people's lives  but we will also transform the way those other lives see us. And that might be smart in these nervous  dangerous times. Don't you think that on a purely commercial level  that anti retroviral drugs are great advertisements for Western ingenuity and technology  Doesn't compassion look well on us  And let's cut the crap for a second. In certain quarters of the world  brand EU  brand USA  is not at its shiniest. The neon sign is fizzing and cracking. Someone's put a brick through the window. The regional branch managers are getting nervous. Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized. Our values  do we have any  Our credibility  These things are under attack around the world. Brand USA could use some polishing. And I say that as a fan  you know  As a person who buys the products. But think about it. More anti retrovirals make sense. But that's just the easy part  or ought to be. But equality for Africa    that's a big  expensive idea. You see  the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference. What on earth can we all do about this  Well  much more than we think. We can't fix every problem  but the ones we can  I want to argue  we must. And because we can  we must. This is the straight truth  the righteous truth. It is not a theory. The fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye  look across the ocean to Africa  and say this  and mean it  we do not have to stand for this. A whole continent written off    we do not have to stand for this. And let me say this without a trace of irony    before I back it up to a bunch of ex hippies. Forget the '  s. We can change the world. I can't  you can't  as individuals  but we can change the world. I really believe that  the people in this room. Look at the Gates Foundation. They've done incredible stuff  unbelievable stuff. But working together  we can actually change the world. We can turn the inevitable outcomes  and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us  when you're up close. I'm sorry to laugh here  but you do look so different than you did in Haight Ashbury in the '  s. But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for. It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier  headier days. Ideas that you gestated in your youth. This is what excites me. This room was born for this moment  is really what I want to say to you tonight. Most of you started out wanting to change the world  didn't you  Most of you did  the digital world. Well  now  actually because of you  it is possible to change the physical world. It's a fact. Economists confirm it  and they know much more than I do. So why  then  are we not pumping our fists into the air  Probably because when we admit we can do something about it  we've got to do something about it. It is a pain in the arse. This equality business is actually a pain in the arse. But for the first time in history  we have the technology  we have the know how  we have the cash  we have the life saving drugs. Do we have the will  I hope this is obvious  but I'm not a hippie. And I'm not really one for the warm  fuzzy feeling. I do not have flowers in my hair. Actually  I come from punk rock. The Clash wore big army boots  not sandals. But I know toughness when I see it. And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast  there was muscle to the movement that started out here. You see  idealism detached from action is just a dream. But idealism allied with pragmatism  with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit  is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong. And it's very present in a crowd like you. Last year at DATA  this organization I helped set up  we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty. We're calling it the ONE Campaign. It's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot  but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world. Well  we feel that now is the time to prove we're right. There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself. We believe this is one. We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable. This could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth. Momentum has been building. Lurching a little  but it's building. This year is a test for us all  especially the leaders of the G  nations  who really are on the line here  with all the world in history watching. I have been  of late  disappointed with the Bush Administration. They started out with such promise on Africa. They made some really great promises  and actually have fulfilled a lot of them. But some of them they haven't. They don't feel the push from the ground  is the truth. But my disappointment has much more perspective when I talk to American people  and I hear their worries about the deficit  and the fiscal well being of their country. I understand that. But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think  if we got organized. What I try to communicate  and you can help me if you agree  is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it. Putting it in the crassest possible terms  the investment reaps huge returns. Not only in lives saved  but in goodwill  stability and security that we'll gain. So this is what I hope that you will do  if I could be so bold  and not have it deducted from my number of wishes. What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts  that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa  by America and by the world. Give them permission  if you like  to spend their political capital and your financial capital  your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people. That's really what I would like you to do. Because we also need your intellectual capital  your ideas  your skills  your ingenuity. And you  at this conference  are in a unique position. Some of the technologies we've been talking about  you invented them  or at least revolutionized the way that they're used. Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital  and pushed the boundaries. And we'd like you to give us that energy. Give us that kind of dreaming  that kind of doing. As I say  there're two things on the line here. There's the continent Africa. But there's also our sense of ourselves. People are starting to figure this out. Movements are springing up. Artists  politicians  pop stars  priests  CEOs  NGOs  mothers' unions  student unions. A lot of people are getting together  and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier  the ONE Campaign. I think they just have one idea in their mind  which is  where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world. History  like God  is watching what we do. When the history books get written  I think our age will be remembered for three things. Really  it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for. The digital revolution  yes. The war against terror  yes. And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa. Some say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to. Thank you  thank you very much. Okay  my three wishes. The ones that TED has offered to grant. You see  if this is true  and I believe it is  that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter  this should be a piece of piss. I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes. Most of them impossible  some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral. This business  it gets to be addictive  you know what I mean  when somebody else is picking up the tab. Anyway  here's number one. I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activists for Africa. That is my first wish. I believe it's possible. A few minutes ago  I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up. You know  there's lots out there. And with this one campaign as our umbrella  my organization  DATA  and other groups  have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America. We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement. We just need your help in making it happen. We want all of you here  church America  corporate America  Microsoft America  Apple America  Coke America  Pepsi America  nerd America  noisy America. We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out. I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong  we're not going to be denied. We will have the ear of Congress. We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book  and right into the Oval Office. If there's one million Americans    and I really know this    who are ready to make phone calls  who are ready to be on email  I am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history  literally  for the continent of Africa. Anyway  so I'd like your help in getting that signed up. I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this  but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to. Right  my second wish  number two. I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day. That's one billion media hits. Could be on Google  could be on AOL. Steve Case  Larry  Sergey    they've done a lot already. It could be NBC. It could be ABC. Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars. We have a film  produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media. But you know  we want  we need some airtime for our ideas. We need to get the math  we need to get the statistics out to the American people. I really believe that old Truman line  that if you give the American people the facts  they'll do the right thing. And  the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers. This has to be described as an adventure  not a burden. a nurse  a teacher  a homemaker  and lives are saved. The problem is enormous. Every three seconds one person dies. Another three seconds  one more. The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa  Asia  even America  that aid groups  just as they did for the tsunami  are uniting as one  acting as one. We can beat extreme poverty  starvation  AIDS. But we need your help. One more person  letter  voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people. Please join us by working together. Americans have an unprecedented opportunity. We can make history. We can start to make poverty history. One  by one  by one. Please visit ONE at this address. We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice. Bono  All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information  its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives  by connecting every hospital  health clinic and school in one African country. And I would like it to be Ethiopia. I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia  every health clinic  every hospital    we can connect to the Internet. That is my wish  my third wish. I think it's possible. I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that. And that would be a mind blowing wish to come true. I've been to Ethiopia  as I said earlier. It's actually where it all started for me. The idea that the Internet  which changed all of our lives  can transform a country    and a continent that has hardly made it to analog  let alone digital    blows my mind. But it didn't start out that way. The first long distance line from Boston to New York was used in      on the phone. It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare  which is     kilometers away. Since then  not that much has changed. The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years. But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then. Anyway  I'm Irish  and as you can see  I know how important talking is. Communication is very important for Ethiopia    will transform the country. Nurses getting better training  pharmacists being able to order supplies  doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine. It's a very  very good idea to get them wired. And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference. Thank you very much once again. I'm Michael Shermer  director of the Skeptics Society  publisher of  Skeptic  magazine. We investigate claims of the paranormal  pseudo science  fringe groups and cults  and claims of all kinds between  science and pseudo science and non science and junk science  voodoo science  pathological science  bad science  non science  and plain old non sense. And unless you've been on Mars recently  you know there's a lot of that out there. Some people call us debunkers  which is kind of a negative term. But let's face it  there's a lot of bunk. We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there    well  we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas  trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas. I'll show you an example of a bad idea. I brought this with me  this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test. It's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia. It's called the Quadro      Dowser Rod. This was being sold to high school administrators for      apiece. It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it. You could dowse for all sorts of things  but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers. So the way it works is you go down the hallway  and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker  and then you open the locker. So it looks something like this. I'll show you. Well  it has kind of a right leaning bias. Well  this is science  so we'll do a controlled experiment. It'll go this way for sure. Sir  do you want to empty your pockets  please  sir  So the question was  can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers  And the answer is  if you open enough of them  yes. But in science  we have to keep track of the misses  not just the hits. And that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here  This is how psychics work  astrologers  tarot card readers and so on. People remember the hits and forget the misses. In science  we keep the whole database  and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number you'd expect by chance. In this case  we tested it. We had two opaque boxes  one with government approved THC marijuana  and one with nothing. And it got it    percent of the time    which is exactly what you'd expect with a coin flip model. So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.  Skeptic  is the quarterly publication. Each one has a particular theme. This one is on the future of intelligence. Are people getting smarter or dumber  I have an opinion of this myself because of the business I'm in  but in fact  people  it turns out  are getting smarter. Three IQ points per    years  going up. Sort of an interesting thing. With science  don't think of skepticism as a thing  or science as a thing. Are science and religion compatible  It's like  are science and plumbing compatible  They're just two different things. Science is not a thing. It's a verb. It's a way of thinking about things. It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena. I mean  what's more likely  that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi dimensional beings travel across vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush  Kansas to promote skeptic.com  our web page  Or is it more likely that a reader of  Skeptic  did this with Photoshop  And in all cases we have to ask    What's the more likely explanation  Before we say something is out of this world  we should first make sure that it's not in this world. What's more likely  that Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship  or that the  World Weekly News  makes stuff up  The same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon. For those of you in the back  it says here   Then a miracle occurs. I think you need to be more explicit here in step two.  This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments. There's nothing more to it than that. You can say a miracle occurs  it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything. There's nothing to test. It's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists. And it's true  scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers    dark energy or dark matter  something like that    until we figure out what it is  we'll call it this. It's the beginning of the causal chain for science. For intelligent design creationists  it's the end of the chain. So again  we can ask this  what's more likely  Are UFOs alien spaceships  or perceptual cognitive mistakes  or even fakes  This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena  California  looking down over Pasadena. And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap  it's because it is. You don't even need Photoshop or high tech equipment  you don't need computers. This was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera. You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go. Camera's ready    that's it. So  although it's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on  and that some of them are real  it's more likely that all of them are fake  like the crop circles. On a more serious note  in all of science we're looking for a balance between data and theory. In the case of Galileo  he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn. First of all  there was no theory of planetary rings. Second of all  his data was grainy and fuzzy  and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at. So he wrote that he had seen     I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies.  And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw. So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data  you can't have a good theory. It wasn't solved until     . This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn. It wasn't till Huygens had two things  He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated  and he had better telescopic  more fine grain data in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster    according to Kepler's Laws    than Saturn  then we catch up with it. And we see the angles of the rings at different angles  there. And that  in fact  turns out to be true. The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases. So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things  on a simple level  and then I'll go to more serious ones. Like  we have a tendency to see faces. This is the face on Mars. In       where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians. Here's the close up of it from     . If you squint  you can still see the face. And when you're squinting  you're turning that from fine grain to coarse grain  so you're reducing the quality of your data. And if I didn't tell you what to look for  you'd still see the face  because we're programmed by evolution to see faces. Faces are important for us socially. And of course  happy faces  faces of all kinds are easy to see. You see the happy face on Mars  there. If astronomers were frogs  perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog. Do you see him there  Little froggy legs. Or if geologists were elephants  Religious iconography. Discovered by a Tennessee baker in     . He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease and desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer. Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville  just down the street  or is it up the street from here  Tree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy  branchy  black and white splotchy and you can get the pattern seeking    humans are pattern seeking animals. Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo. Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich    which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino    of course  this being America. This casino paid         on eBay for the cheese sandwich. But who does it really look like  The Virgin Mary  It has that sort of puckered lips      s era look. Virgin Mary in Clearwater  Florida. I actually went to see this one. There was a lot of people there. The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches  and so on. We went down and investigated. Just to give you a size  that's Dawkins  me and The Amazing Randi  next to this two  two and a half story sized image. All these candles  thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this. So we walked around the backside  to see what was going on. It turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree  you get the effect. Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside  which they started to wipe off. I guess you can only have one miracle per building. So is it really a miracle of Mary  or is it a miracle of Marge  And now I'm going to finish up with another example of this  with auditory illusions. There's this film   White Noise   with Michael Keaton  about the dead talking back to us. By the way  the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal. Anybody can do it  turns out. It's getting the dead to talk back that's the really hard part. In this case  supposedly  these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena. There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page where I downloaded this stuff. This is the most famous one of all of these. Here's the forward version of the very famous song. If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the May Queen. Yes  there are two paths you can go by  but in the long run  There's still time to change the road you're on. Couldn't you just listen to that all day  All right  here it is backwards  and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there. What did you get  Audience  Satan  Satan. OK  at least we got  Satan . Now  I'll prime the auditory part of your brain to tell you what you're supposed to hear  and then hear it again. You can't miss it when I tell you what's there. I'm going to just end with a positive  nice little story. The Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization. We're always looking for little good things that people do. And in England  there's a pop singer. One of the top popular singers in England today  Katie Melua. And she wrote a beautiful song. It was in the top five in       called   Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing.  It's a love story    she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK    about how she much loves her guy  and compared to nine million bicycles  and so forth. And she has this one passage here. That's a guess  No one can ever say it's true  But I know that I will always be with you. Michael Shermer  Well  that's nice. At least she got it close. In America it'd be   We're       light years from the edge.  But my friend  Simon Singh  the particle physicist now turned science educator  who wrote the book  The Big Bang   and so on  uses every chance he gets to promote good science. And so he wrote an op ed piece in  The Guardian  about Katie's song  in which he said  well  we know exactly how far from the edge. You know  it's   .  billion light years  and it's not a guess. We know within precise error bars how close it is. So we can say  although not absolutely true  it's pretty close to being true. And  to his credit  Katie called him up after this op ed piece came out  and said   I'm so embarrassed. I was in the astronomy club. I should've known better.  And she re cut the song. So I will end with the new version. We are   .  billion light years from the edge of the observable universe. That's a good estimate with well defined error bars. And with the available information  I predict that I will always be with you. How cool is that  As other speakers have said  it's a rather daunting experience    a particularly daunting experience    to be speaking in front of this audience. But unlike the other speakers  I'm not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe  or the wonders of evolution  or the really clever  innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world. Or even the challenges of nation states in the modern global economy. My brief  as you've just heard  is to tell you about statistics    and  to be more precise  to tell you some exciting things about statistics. And that's       that's rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me. One of my senior colleagues told me  when I was a youngster in this profession  rather proudly  that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn't have the personality skills to become accountants. And there's another in joke among statisticians  and that's   How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician   To which the answer is   The extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes.  But I want to tell you something useful    and here it is  so concentrate now. This evening  there's a reception in the University's Museum of Natural History. And it's a wonderful setting  as I hope you'll find  and a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition. It's very unlikely    in this special setting  and this collection of people    but you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather wish that you weren't. So here's what you do. When they say to you   What do you do      you say   I'm a statistician.  Well  except they've been pre warned now  and they'll know you're making it up. And then one of two things will happen. They'll either discover their long lost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them. Or they'll suddenly become parched and or hungry    and often both    and sprint off for a drink and some food. And you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to. It's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do. We're not top on people's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on. And it's something I've never really found a good way of doing. But my wife    who was then my girlfriend    managed it much better than I've ever been able to. Many years ago  when we first started going out  she was working for the BBC in Britain  and I was  at that stage  working in America. I was coming back to visit her. She told this to one of her colleagues  who said   Well  what does your boyfriend do   Sarah thought quite hard about the things I'd explained    and she concentrated  in those days  on listening. Don't tell her I said that. And she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics. So when her colleague said   What does he do   She paused and said   He models things.  Well  her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect and went on and said   What does he model   Well  Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said   Genes.   He models genes.  That is my first love  and that's what I'll tell you a little bit about. What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world  and how we react to that  and how well we do or don't think about it. So you've had a pretty easy time up till now    a few laughs  and all that kind of thing    in the talks to date. You've got to think  and I'm going to ask you some questions. So here's the scene for the first question I'm going to ask you. Can you imagine tossing a coin successively  And for some reason    which shall remain rather vague    we're interested in a particular pattern. Here's one    a head  followed by a tail  followed by a tail. So suppose we toss a coin repeatedly. Then the pattern  head tail tail  that we've suddenly become fixated with happens here. And you can count  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine        it happens after the   th toss. So you might think there are more interesting things to do  but humor me for the moment. Imagine this half of the audience each get out coins  and they toss them until they first see the pattern head tail tail. The first time they do it  maybe it happens after the   th toss  as here. The second time  maybe it's after the fourth toss. The next time  after the   th toss. So you do that lots and lots of times  and you average those numbers. That's what I want this side to think about. The other half of the audience doesn't like head tail tail    they think  for deep cultural reasons  that's boring    and they're much more interested in a different pattern    head tail head. So  on this side  you get out your coins  and you toss and toss and toss. And you count the number of times until the pattern head tail head appears and you average them. OK  So on this side  you've got a number    you've done it lots of times  so you get it accurately    which is the average number of tosses until head tail tail. On this side  you've got a number    the average number of tosses until head tail head. So here's a deep mathematical fact    if you've got two numbers  one of three things must be true. Either they're the same  or this one's bigger than this one  or this one's bigger than that one. So what's going on here  So you've all got to think about this  and you've all got to vote    and we're not moving on. And I don't want to end up in the two minute silence to give you more time to think about it  until everyone's expressed a view. OK. So what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see head tail head with the average number of tosses until we first see head tail tail. Who thinks that A is true    that  on average  it'll take longer to see head tail head than head tail tail  Who thinks that B is true    that on average  they're the same  Who thinks that C is true    that  on average  it'll take less time to see head tail head than head tail tail  OK  who hasn't voted yet  Because that's really naughty    I said you had to. OK. So most people think B is true. And you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that. It's not. A is true here. It takes longer  on average. In fact  the average number of tosses till head tail head is    and the average number of tosses until head tail tail is eight. How could that be  Anything different about the two patterns  There is. Head tail head overlaps itself. If you went head tail head tail head  you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses. You can't do that with head tail tail. That turns out to be important. There are two ways of thinking about this. I'll give you one of them. So imagine    let's suppose we're doing it. On this side    remember  you're excited about head tail tail  you're excited about head tail head. We start tossing a coin  and we get a head    and you start sitting on the edge of your seat because something great and wonderful  or awesome  might be about to happen. The next toss is a tail    you get really excited. The champagne's on ice just next to you  you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate. You're waiting with bated breath for the final toss. And if it comes down a head  that's great. You're done  and you celebrate. If it's a tail    well  rather disappointedly  you put the glasses away and put the champagne back. And you keep tossing  to wait for the next head  to get excited. On this side  there's a different experience. It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence. You're a little bit excited with the first head    you get rather more excited with the next tail. Then you toss the coin. If it's a tail  you crack open the champagne. If it's a head you're disappointed  but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again. And that's an informal way of presenting it    that's why there's a difference. Another way of thinking about it    if we tossed a coin eight million times  then we'd expect a million head tail heads and a million head tail tails    but the head tail heads could occur in clumps. So if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions and you can have some of them overlapping  the clumps will be further apart. It's another way of getting the intuition. What's the point I want to make  It's a very  very simple example  an easily stated question in probability  which every    you're in good company    everybody gets wrong. This is my little diversion into my real passion  which is genetics. There's a connection between head tail heads and head tail tails in genetics  and it's the following. When you toss a coin  you get a sequence of heads and tails. When you look at DNA  there's a sequence of not two things    heads and tails    but four letters    As  Gs  Cs and Ts. And there are little chemical scissors  called restriction enzymes which cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns. And they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology. And instead of asking the question   How long until I see a head tail head      you can ask   How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees G A A G  for example  How long will those chunks be   That's a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics. There's a much deeper connection  which I don't have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science. And we'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that. But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies  a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated    you'll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job  rather more sophisticated than the head tail head story    but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques. And I will give you two little snippets    two examples    of projects we're involved in in my group in Oxford  both of which I think are rather exciting. You know about the Human Genome Project. That was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome. The natural thing to do after you've done that    and that's what this project  the International HapMap Project  which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries. Think of the Human Genome Project as learning what we've got in common  and the HapMap Project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people. Why do we care about that  Well  there are lots of reasons. The most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease    type   diabetes  for example    and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease  or stroke  or autism and so on. That's one big project. There's a second big project  recently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country  involving very large studies    thousands of individuals  with each of eight different diseases  common diseases like type   and type   diabetes  and coronary heart disease  bipolar disease and so on    to try and understand the genetics. To try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases. Why do we want to do that  Because we understand very little about most human diseases. We don't know what causes them. And if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics  we'll have a window on the way the disease works  and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventative treatment and so on. So that's  as I said  the little diversion on my main love. Back to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty. Here's another quiz for you    now suppose we've got a test for a disease which isn't infallible  but it's pretty good. It gets it right    percent of the time. And I take one of you  or I take someone off the street  and I test them for the disease in question. Let's suppose there's a test for HIV    the virus that causes AIDS    and the test says the person has the disease. What's the chance that they do  The test gets it right    percent of the time. So a natural answer is    percent. Who likes that answer  Come on    everyone's got to get involved. Don't think you don't trust me anymore. Well  you're right to be a bit skeptical  because that's not the answer. That's what you might think. It's not the answer  and it's not because it's only part of the story. It actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is. So let me try and illustrate that. Here's a little caricature of a million individuals. So let's think about a disease that affects    it's pretty rare  it affects one person in       . Amongst these million individuals  most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease. And in fact  if this is the prevalence of the disease  about     will have the disease and the rest won't. So now suppose we test them all. What happens  Well  amongst the     who do have the disease  the test will get it right    percent of the time  and    will test positive. Amongst all these other people who don't have the disease  the test will get it right    percent of the time. It'll only get it wrong one percent of the time. But there are so many of them that there'll be an enormous number of false positives. Put that another way    of all of them who test positive    so here they are  the individuals involved    less than one in     actually have the disease. So even though we think the test is accurate  the important part of the story is there's another bit of information we need. Here's the key intuition. What we have to do  once we know the test is positive  is to weigh up the plausibility  or the likelihood  of two competing explanations. Each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit. One explanation is that the person doesn't have the disease    that's overwhelmingly likely  if you pick someone at random    but the test gets it wrong  which is unlikely. The other explanation is that the person does have the disease    that's unlikely    but the test gets it right  which is likely. And the number we end up with    that number which is a little bit less than one in        is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other. Each of them taken together is unlikely. Here's a more topical example of exactly the same thing. Those of you in Britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called Sally Clark  who had two babies who died suddenly. And initially  it was thought that they died of what's known informally as  cot death   and more formally as  Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  For various reasons  she was later charged with murder. And at the trial  her trial  a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths  innocent deaths  in a family like hers    which was professional and non smoking    was one in    million. To cut a long story short  she was convicted at the time. Later  and fairly recently  acquitted on appeal    in fact  on the second appeal. And just to set it in context  you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child  and then two  if they're innocent  to be convicted of murdering them. To be put through the stress of the trial  convicted of murdering them    and to spend time in a women's prison  where all the other prisoners think you killed your children    is a really awful thing to happen to someone. And it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong  in two different ways. So where did he get the one in    million number  He looked at some research  which said the chance of one cot death in a family like Sally Clark's is about one in      . So he said   I'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family  the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren't changed.  So that's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence. It's like saying   If you toss a coin and get a head the first time  that won't affect the chance of getting a head the second time.  So if you toss a coin twice  the chance of getting a head twice are a half    that's the chance the first time    times a half    the chance a second time. So he said   Here  I'll assume that these events are independent. When you multiply       together twice  you get about    million.  And none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way. Unfortunately here    and  really  regrettably    first of all  in a situation like this you'd have to verify it empirically. And secondly  it's palpably false. There are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths. It might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of  and it's pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we're not aware of. So if a family suffers from one cot death  you'd put them in a high risk group. They've probably got these environmental risk factors and or genetic risk factors we don't know about. And to argue  then  that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly. It's worse than silly    it's really bad science. Nonetheless  that's how it was presented  and at trial nobody even argued it. That's the first problem. The second problem is  what does the number of one in    million mean  So after Sally Clark was convicted    you can imagine  it made rather a splash in the press    one of the journalists from one of Britain's more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was   The chance that she was innocent was one in    million.  Now  that's a logical error. It's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test  which is    percent accurate  the chance of having the disease is    percent. In the disease example  we had to bear in mind two things  one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not. And the other one was the chance  a priori  that the person had the disease or not. It's exactly the same in this context. There are two things involved    two parts to the explanation. We want to know how likely  or relatively how likely  two different explanations are. One of them is that Sally Clark was innocent    which is  a priori  overwhelmingly likely    most mothers don't kill their children. And the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event. Not as unlikely as one in    million  but nonetheless rather unlikely. The other explanation is that she was guilty. Now  we probably think a priori that's unlikely. And we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that's unlikely  because of the presumption of innocence. And then if she were trying to kill the children  she succeeded. So the chance that she's innocent isn't one in    million. We don't know what it is. It has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence. We know the children died. What matters is how likely or unlikely  relative to each other  the two explanations are. And they're both implausible. There's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences. In fact  there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician  who have subsequently been released on appeal. Many cases were reviewed. And it's particularly topical because he's currently facing a disrepute charge at Britain's General Medical Council. So just to conclude    what are the take home messages from this  Well  we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life. It's also true    and  although  you  as a collective  are very special in many ways  you're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right. It's very well documented that people get things wrong. They make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty. We can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly    and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here. We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty. That's an issue in our everyday lives. As you've heard from many of the talks  statistics underpins an enormous amount of research in science    in social science  in medicine and indeed  quite a lot of industry. All of quality control  which has had a major impact on industrial processing  is underpinned by statistics. It's something we're bad at doing. At the very least  we should recognize that  and we tend not to. To go back to the legal context  at the Sally Clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said. So if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury   I know how to build bridges. I've built one down the road. Please drive your car home over it   they would have said   Well  pediatricians don't know how to build bridges. That's what engineers do.  On the other hand  he came out and effectively said  or implied   I know how to reason with uncertainty. I know how to do statistics.  And everyone said   Well  that's fine. He's an expert.  So we need to understand where our competence is and isn't. Exactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling  when scientists  and lawyers and in some cases judges  routinely misrepresented evidence. Usually    one hopes    innocently  but misrepresented evidence. Forensic scientists said   The chance that this guy's innocent is one in three million.  Even if you believe the number  just like the    million to one  that's not what it meant. And there have been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that. And just to finish in the context of the legal system. It's all very well to say   Let's do our best to present the evidence.  But more and more  in cases of DNA profiling    this is another one    we expect juries  who are ordinary people    and it's documented they're very bad at this    we expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on. In other spheres of life  if people argued    well  except possibly for politics    but in other spheres of life  if people argued illogically  we'd say that's not a good thing. We sort of expect it of politicians and don't hope for much more. In the case of uncertainty  we get it wrong all the time    and at the very least  we should be aware of that  and ideally  we might try and do something about it. Thanks very much. I don't know about you  but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life. I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about. Should I be pro technology  Should I embrace it full arms  Should I be wary  Like you  I'm very tempted by the latest thing. But at the other hand  a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions  sold all my technology    except for a bicycle    and rode across       miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body  fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food. And I've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways  so it doesn't master my life. At the same time  I run a website on cool tools  where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology. So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity  as it relates to nature  as it relates to the spiritual. And I'm not even sure we know what technology is. And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded. This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find. It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in     . Before that  obviously  technology didn't exist. But obviously it did. I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology. He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born. So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about. Danny Hillis actually has an update on that    he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet. Which also  I think  gets into a little bit of our current idea. But I was interested in another definition of technology. Something  again  that went back to something more fundamental. Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that  I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations. And I'm  this morning  going to talk about this for the first time. So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud. The question that I came up with was this question  what does technology want  And by that  I don't mean  does it want chocolate or vanilla  By what it wants  I mean  what are its inherent trends and biases  What are its tendencies over time  One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms  which we've heard a lot about. And the trick that Richard Dawkins does  which is to say  to look at them as simply as genes  as vehicles for genes. So he's saying  what do genes want  The selfish gene. And I'm applying a similar trick to say  what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology  What does technology want  Obviously  this in an incomplete question  just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it. But it's still very  very productive. So I'm attempting to say  if we take technology's view of the world  what does it want  And I think once we ask that question we have to go back  actually  to life. Because obviously  if we keep extending the origins of technology far back  I think we come back to life at some point. So that's where I want to begin my little exploration  is in life. And like you heard from the previous speakers  we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now. We have really no idea. Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great. Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth. And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects  just to see what's on life. And if we did that with our little Martian probe  which we have not done on Earth  we would begin to see some incredible species. This is not on another planet. These are things that are hidden away on our planet. This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen. Each one of these organisms that we've described    that you've seen from Jamie and others  these magnificent things    what they're doing  each one of them  is they're hacking the rules of life. I can't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism. Every single thing that we can think of    and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits  you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life  because every single one of them is hacking something about it. This is a solar powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy. This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon  and the one on the bottom  the blue one  is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid  has not yet taken in the brown green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy. These are hacks  and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are  current consensus  six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches  the plants  the animals  the fungi  the protests    the little things    the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas. Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today. But a more interesting way  the current way to take the long view  is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective. And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time  we have it coming out from the center. So in the center is the most primitive  and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms. You see       representative species  and you can see where we are. But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved. Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans. They've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here. But we see that each one of these is actually hacking  and has a different way of finding out how to do life. And if we take the long term trends of life  if we begin to say  what does evolution want  There's several things that we see. One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life. We find life at the bottom of every long term  long distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up    and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock. And wherever life is  it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more. More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life. The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization. We see the movement from a general purpose cell to the more specific and specialized. And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive. And actually  we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time. And the last thing  I bring back this nudibranch. One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life. Like those chloroplast cells    they're completely surrounded by other life. They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co evolution. And so the general  long term trends of evolution are roughly these five  ubiquity  diversity  specialization  complexity and socialization. Now  I took that and said  OK  what are the long term trends in technology  And again  my question is  what does technology want  And so  remarkably  I discovered that there's also a drift toward specialization. That we see there's a general hammer  and hammers become more and more specific over time. There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things. This is all the contents of a Japanese home. I actually had my daughter    gave her a tally counter  and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household. And it came up with       different species of products. I did some research and found out that the King of England  Henry VIII  had only about       items in his household. And he was the King of England  and that was the entire wealth of England at the time. So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things. This is a scene from Star Wars where the  PO comes out and he sees machines making machines. How depraved  Well  this is actually what we're headed towards  world machines. And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies. Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non technology  or even life. And thirdly  the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say  I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological  but that's pretty evident. So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see towards ubiquity  towards diversity  towards socialization  towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out  say  the evolution of armor  you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary type cladistic tree. I suggest that  in fact  technology is the seventh kingdom of life. That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom. And so it would be sort of approximately up there  coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that  we would find out    we could actually approach technology in this way. This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium. But as a sideline  he happens to collect cornets. He has one of the world's largest collections    about     of them. And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites  or snails  and to do a morphological analysis  and try to derive their genealogical history over time. This is his chart  which is not quite published yet. But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom  those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology. When something is extinct  you can't have it as your parent. But that does happen in technology. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree  and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system. In fact  this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology. And it turns out that  in fact  technologies don't die. So I suggested this to an historian of science  and he said   Well  what about  you know  come on  what about steam cars  They're not around anymore.  Well actually  they are. In fact  they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile. And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked is sort of this one click  add to your cart button    for buying steam valves. I mean  it was just    it was really there. And so  I began to think about  well  maybe that's just a random sample. Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way. So I took the great big      Montgomery Ward's catalog and I randomly went through it. And I took a page    not quite a random page    I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made. But I took this page and I said  how many of these things are still being made  And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production. And the answer is  all of them. All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers. I don't know who needs a corn sheller. Be it corn shellers    you've got ploughs  you've got fan mills  all these things    and these are not  again  antiques. These are    you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now  brand new made. So in a certain sense  technologies don't die. In fact  you can buy  for    bucks  a stone age knife made exactly the same way that they were made        years ago. It's short  bone handle     bucks. And in fact  what's important is that this information actually never died out. It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along. And in Papua New Guinea  they were making stone axes until two decades ago  just as a course of practical matters. Even when we try to get rid of a technology  it's actually very hard. So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars. We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns. We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and took what I could find  the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology  and then I tried to find out when they came back in  because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time  the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited  is decreasing over time. And that basically  you can delay technology  but you can't kill it. So this makes sense  because in a certain sense what culture is  is the accumulation of ideas. That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out. And when we take that  we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long term trajectory    again  in life's evolution    we find that each case    each of the major transitions in life    what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens. They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated. So all these steps in evolution are increasing  basically  the evolution of evolvability. So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas  these new hacks  are increasing. And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring. And then what we see in the singularity  that prophesized by Kurzweil and others    his idea that technology is accelerating evolution. It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas. So if you have life hacking    life means hacking  the game of survival    then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game. And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve. That is what we call an  infinite game.  That's the definition of  infinite game.  A finite game is play to win  and an infinite game is played to keep playing. And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force. The origins of technology was not in       but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang  and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot  and it was so tight in there  there was no room for any difference at all. That's the definition. There was no temperature. There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang  what it expanded was the potential for difference. So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences  diversity  options  choices  opportunities  possibilities and freedoms. Those are all basically the same thing. And those are the things that technology brings us. That's what technology is bringing us  choices  possibilities  freedoms. That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences. And so a hammer  when we grab a hammer  that's what we're grabbing. And that's why we continue to grab technology    because we want those things. Those things are good. Differences  freedom  choices  possibilities. And each time we make a new opportunity place  we're allowing a platform to make new ones. And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented    what a loss to society there would be. Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints. Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film. Somewhere  today  there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self expression has not yet been invented. We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference. We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals. That's what technology really wants. I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation. I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity  other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom  because it's so close to what life is about  maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life. Maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it. It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields  but it's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village. Our humanity is actually defined by technology. All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game. That's what we're talking about. You see  technology is a way to evolve the evolution. It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more. And it's actually a way of playing the game  of playing all the games. That's what technology wants. And so when I think about what technology wants  I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here    and I really believe this    every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is. That recursive nature is the infinite game. And if you play that well  you'll have other people involved  so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone. That is the infinite game. And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game. And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are. Thank you. Well  it's great to be here. We've heard a lot about the promise of technology  and the peril. I've been quite interested in both. If we could convert  .   percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy  we could meet all of our projected needs for     . We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy  expensive and very inefficient. There are nano engineered designs  which at least have been analyzed theoretically  that show the potential to be very lightweight  very inexpensive  very efficient  and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way. Nano engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it's needed. That's a key trend  which is decentralization  moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly  a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption. Bono spoke very eloquently  that we have the tools  for the first time  to address age old problems of disease and poverty. Most regions of the world are moving in that direction. In       in East Asia and the Pacific region  there were     million people living in poverty    that number now is under     million. The World Bank projects by       it will be under    million  which is a reduction of    percent. I did enjoy Bono's comment linking Haight Ashbury to Silicon Valley. Being from the Massachusetts high tech community myself  I'd point out that we were hippies also in the     s  although we hung around Harvard Square. But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty  and I'm going to talk about those issues  if we have the will. Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology. That's been a strong interest of mine  and a theme that I've developed for some    years. I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project. That invariably  the world was a different place when I would introduce a technology. And  I noticed that most inventions fail  not because the R D department can't get it to work    if you look at most business plans  they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build    and    percent of those projects or more will fail  because the timing is wrong    not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed. So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends  and track where technology would be at different points in time  and began to build the mathematical models of that. It's kind of taken on a life of its own. I've got a group of    people that work with me to gather data on key measures of technology in many different areas  and we build models. And you'll hear people say  well  we can't predict the future. And if you ask me  will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now  that's very hard to say. Will WiMax CDMA G  be the wireless standard three years from now  That's hard to say. But if you ask me  what will it cost for one MIPS of computing in       or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in       or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in       it turns out that those are very predictable. There are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance  capacity  bandwidth. And I'm going to show you a small sample of this  but there's really a theoretical reason why technology develops in an exponential fashion. And a lot of people  when they think about the future  think about it linearly. They think they're going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using today's tools  at today's pace of progress  and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth. The Genome Project was a controversial project in     . We had our best Ph.D. students  our most advanced equipment around the world  we got         th of the project done  so how're we going to get this done in    years  And    years into the project  the skeptics were still going strong    says   You're two thirds through this project  and you've managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome.  But it's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve  it explodes. Most of the project was done in the last few years of the project. It took us    years to sequence HIV    we sequenced SARS in    days. So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems. I'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is. The actual paradigm shift rate  the rate of adopting new ideas  is doubling every decade  according to our models. These are all logarithmic graphs  so as you go up the levels it represents  generally multiplying by factor of    or    . It took us half a century to adopt the telephone  the first virtual reality technology. Cell phones were adopted in about eight years. If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph  television  radio  telephone were adopted in decades. Recent technologies    like the PC  the web  cell phones    were under a decade. Now this is an interesting chart  and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process    and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes    accelerate. They work through interaction    they create a capability  and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage. So the first step in biological evolution  the evolution of DNA    actually it was RNA came first    took billions of years  but then evolution used that information processing backbone to bring on the next stage. So the Cambrian Explosion  when all the body plans of the animals were evolved  took only    million years. It was     times faster. And then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions  and biological evolution kept accelerating. It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process. So Homo sapiens  the first technology creating species  the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage    and by the way  chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb    so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination  and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology. But anyway  the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years  and then working through interaction  evolution used  essentially  the technology creating species to bring on the next stage  which were the first steps in technological evolution. And the first step took tens of thousands of years    stone tools  fire  the wheel    kept accelerating. We always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation. Printing press took a century to be adopted  the first computers were designed pen on paper    now we use computers. And we've had a continual acceleration of this process. Now by the way  if you look at this on a linear graph  it looks like everything has just happened  but some observer says   Well  Kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line.  So  I took    different lists from key thinkers  like the Encyclopedia Britannica  the Museum of Natural History  Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar on the same    and these people were not trying to make my point  these were just lists in reference works  and I think that's what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution. And again  it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements  what the key points are  there's differences of opinion when agriculture started  or how long the Cambrian Explosion took. But you see a very clear trend. There's a basic  profound acceleration of this evolutionary process. Information technologies double their capacity  price performance  bandwidth  every year. And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth. A personal experience  when I was at MIT    computer taking up about the size of this room  less powerful than the computer in your cell phone. But Moore's Law  which is very often identified with this exponential growth  is just one example of many  because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology. I put    famous computers on this logarithmic graph    by the way  a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth    that's another exponential. It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in       two years in the middle  we're now doubling it every one year. And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms. Moore's Law was just the last part of that  where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit  but we had electro mechanical calculators  relay based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code  vacuum tubes in the     s predicted the election of Eisenhower  discreet transistors used in the first space flights and then Moore's Law. Every time one paradigm ran out of steam  another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth. They were shrinking vacuum tubes  making them smaller and smaller. That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum. Whole different paradigm    transistors came out of the woodwork. In fact  when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm  it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm. And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law for quite a long time    the first prediction said       until now it says     . But by the teen years  the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width  and we won't be able to shrink them any more. That'll be the end of Moore's Law  but it won't be the end of the exponential growth of computing  because chips are flat. We live in a three dimensional world  we might as well use the third dimension. We will go into the third dimension and there's been tremendous progress  just in the last few years  of getting three dimensional  self organizing molecular circuits to work. We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam. Supercomputers    same thing. Processor performance on Intel chips  the average price of a transistor          you could buy one transistor for a dollar. You could buy    million in     . It's pretty remarkable how smooth an exponential process that is. I mean  you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment  but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior    countries accusing each other of dumping products  IPOs  bankruptcies  marketing programs. You would think it would be a very erratic process  and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process. Just as we can't predict what one molecule in a gas will do    it's hopeless to predict a single molecule    yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas  using thermodynamics  very accurately. It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project  but the result of this whole worldwide  chaotic  unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable. And we can predict these trends far into the future. Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses  it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor. As we make them smaller and less expensive  the electrons have less distance to travel. They're faster  so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors  so the cost of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of  .  years. You add other forms of innovation and processor design  you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year. And that's basically deflation       percent deflation. And it's not just computers. I mean  it's true of DNA sequencing  it's true of brain scanning  it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean  anything that we can quantify  we have hundreds of different measurements of different  information related measurements    capacity  adoption rates    and they basically double every            months  depending on what you're looking at. In terms of price performance  that's a    to    percent deflation rate. And economists have actually started worrying about that. We had deflation during the Depression  but that was collapse of the money supply  collapse of consumer confidence  a completely different phenomena. This is due to greater productivity  but the economist says   But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that. If you have    percent deflation  people may increase their volume        percent  but they won't keep up with it.  But what we're actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it. We've had    percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last    years. I mean  people didn't build iPods for        dollars    years ago. As the price performance makes new applications feasible  new applications come to the market. And this is a very widespread phenomena. Magnetic data storage    that's not Moore's Law  it's shrinking magnetic spots  different engineers  different companies  same exponential process. A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology in these information terms. We're understanding the software programs that make our body run. These were evolved in very different times    we'd like to actually change those programs. One little software program  called the fat insulin receptor gene  basically says   Hold onto every calorie  because the next hunting season may not work out so well.  That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago. We'd like to actually turn that program off. They tried that in animals  and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim. They didn't get diabetes  they didn't get heart disease  they lived    percent longer  they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction. Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this  felt that would be interesting drug for the human market  and that's just one of the        genes that affect our biochemistry. We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference  like myself  to live much longer  because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them. So  life    long lifespans    like  that is to say  much more than       weren't selected for  but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution. For example  we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference. There are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome. There's actually a    for the first time now  something going to human trials  that actually cures pulmonary hypertension    a fatal disease    using gene therapy. So we'll have not just designer babies  but designer baby boomers. And this technology is also accelerating. It cost    dollars per base pair in       then a penny in     . It's now under a   th of a cent. The amount of genetic data    basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year  enabling the genome project to be completed. Another major revolution  the communications revolution. The price performance  bandwidth  capacity of communications measured many different ways  wired  wireless is growing exponentially. The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to  measured many different ways. This is based on the number of hosts. Miniaturization    we're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate  both wired and wireless. These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book    which we're now showing are feasible with super computing simulations  where actually there are scientists building molecule scale robots. One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human like gait  that's built out of molecules. There are little machines doing things in experimental bases. The most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions. And this is less futuristic than it may sound. These things have already been done in animals. There's one nano engineered device that cures type   diabetes. It's blood cell sized. They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell    they tried this in rats    it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion  and actually cures type   diabetes. What you're watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell  and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub optimal  even though it's remarkable in its intricacy. Once we understand its principles of operation  and the pace with which we are reverse engineering biology is accelerating  we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable. An analysis of this respirocyte  designed by Rob Freitas  indicates if you replace    percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions  you could do an Olympic sprint for    minutes without taking a breath. You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours    so   Honey  I'm in the pool   will take on a whole new meaning. It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials. Presumably we'll ban them  but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out performing the Olympic athletes. Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell. These are      circa scenarios  but they're not as futuristic as it may sound. There are four major conferences on building blood cell sized devices  there are many experiments in animals. There's actually one going into human trial  so this is feasible technology. If we come back to our exponential growth of computing        dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain. It will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the     s  but that'll be the hardware side of the equation. Where will we get the software  Well  it turns out we can see inside the human brain  and in fact not surprisingly  the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year. And with the new generation of scanning tools  for the first time we can actually see individual inter neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time    but then the question is  OK  we can get this data now  but can we understand it  Doug Hofstadter wonders  well  maybe our intelligence just isn't great enough to understand our intelligence  and if we were smarter  well  then our brains would be that much more complicated  and we'd never catch up to it. It turns out that we can understand it. This is a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well    in applying psychoacoustic tests  gets very similar results to human auditory perception. There's another simulation of the cerebellum    that's more than half the neurons in the brain    again  works very similarly to human skill formation. This is at an early stage  but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning  we will succeed in reverse engineering the human brain by the     s. We've already had very good models and simulation of about    regions out of the several hundred. All of this is driving exponentially growing economic progress. We've had productivity go from    dollars to     dollars per hour of labor in the last    years. E commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars. You might wonder  well  wasn't there a boom and a bust  That was strictly a capital markets phenomena. Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology  which it was  but then six months later  when it hadn't revolutionized all business models  they figured  well  that was wrong  and then we had this bust. All right  this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in. This will be a routine feature in a cell phone. It would be able to translate from one language to another. So let me just end with a couple of scenarios. By      computers will disappear. They'll be so small  they'll be embedded in our clothing  in our environment. Images will be written directly to our retina  providing full immersion virtual reality  augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities. But if we go to       we really have the full maturity of these trends  and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology  which are getting faster and faster  we'll have at that point. I mean  we will have two to the   th power greater price performance  capacity and bandwidth of these technologies  which is pretty phenomenal. It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today. We'll have completed the reverse engineering of the human brain        dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity. Computers will combine the subtle pan recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior  in terms of doing analytic thinking  remembering billions of facts accurately. Machines can share their knowledge very quickly. But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines. We are going to merge with our technology. These nano bots I mentioned will first be used for medical and health applications  cleaning up the environment  providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment. But they'll also go inside our brain  interact with our biological neurons. We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this. So  for example  full immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system  the nano bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses  replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment  and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment. You can go there with other people  have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses.  Experience beamers   I call them  will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet. You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else. But most importantly  it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology  which in some sense we're doing already. We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology. Human life expectancy is expanding. It was    in       and with this sort of biotechnology  nano technology revolutions  this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead. My main message is that progress in technology is exponential  not linear. Many    even scientists    assume a linear model  so they'll say   Oh  it'll be hundreds of years before we have self replicating nano technology assembly or artificial intelligence.  If you really look at the power of exponential growth  you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand. And information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives  from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials. We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the     s  from information  in very inexpensive raw materials  using nano technology. These are very powerful technologies. They both empower our promise and our peril. So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems. Thank you very much. I love trees  and I'm very lucky  because we live near a wonderful arboretum  and Sundays  usually  I'd go there with my wife and now  with my four year old  and we'd climb in the trees  we'd play hide and seek. The second school I was at had big trees too  had a fantastic tulip tree  I think it was the biggest in the country  and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it  around the playing fields. One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates  and taken in the bushes    I was stripped  I was attacked  I was abused  and this came out of the blue. Now  the reason I say that  because  afterwards  I was thinking    well  I went back into the school    I felt dirty  I felt betrayed  I felt ashamed  but mainly    mainly  I felt powerless. And    years later I was sitting in an airplane  next to a lady called Veronica  who came from Chile  and we were on a human rights tour  and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured  and  from my very privileged position  this was the only reference point that I had. And it was an amazing learning experience because  for me  human rights have been something in which I had  you know  a part time interest  but  mainly  it was something that happened to other people over there. But I got a phone call from Bono in      and  as you know  he's a great singer  but he's a magnificent hustler  and    a very hard guy to say no to  and he was saying  you know  just after I'd done the Biko song  we're going to do a tour for Amnesty  you have to be on it  and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people who'd watched their family being shot in front of them  who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean  and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world  and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before. So I got involved with this tour  which was for Amnesty  and then in '   I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle. I didn't do it as well  but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour  Sting  Tracy Chapman  and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty  and it was an amazing experience. And  once again  I got an extraordinary education  and it was the first time  really  that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries  and these human rights stories became very physical  and  again  I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably. But the thing that really amazed me  that I had no idea  was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience  your story  denied  buried and forgotten. And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around  or a video or film camera  it was a great deal harder to do    for those in power to bury the story. And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then    well  we made a proposal  for a couple of years  about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists. It didn't really get anywhere  and then the Rodney King incident happened  and people thought  OK  if you have a camera in the right place at the right time  or  perhaps  the wrong time  depending who you are  then you can actually start doing something  and campaigning  and being heard  and telling people about what's going on. So  WITNESS was started in '   and it's since given cameras out in over    countries. And we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and  in fact  I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns  and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda  and  although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday  this one isn't quite so good. In the north of Uganda  there are something like  .  million internally displaced people  people who are not refugees in another country  but because of the civil war  which has been going on for about    years  they have nowhere to live. And        kids have been taken away to become child soldiers  and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the    now  what's it called  I forget the name of the of the army    it's Lord's Resistance Army  I believe    but the government  also  doesn't have a clean sheet  so if we could run the first video. Woman  Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult. We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ... still exists back home. Text   Between Two Fires  Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda  Man  When we were at home  it was Kony's  rebel  soldiers disturbing us. At first  we were safe in the camp. But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot. Jennifer  A soldier walked onto the road  asking where we'd been. Evelyn and I hid behind my mother. Evelyn  He ordered us to sit down  so we sat down. The other soldier also came. Jennifer  The man came and started undressing me. The other one carried Evelyn aside. The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn. And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also. Man  The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession. They kept telling us   Tell the truth   as they beat us. Woman  They insisted that I was lying. At that moment  they fired and shot off my fingers. I fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead. Text  Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in     . Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering  whether physical or mental  is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity to obtain information or a confession  to punish  coerce or intimidate. Peter Gabriel  So torture is not something that always happens on other soil. In my country  it was    we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis  we've got Abu Ghraib  we've got Guantanamo Bay. I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport  and he told me a story that  in the middle of the night    a.m.  he'd been taken out of his home in Queens    taken to a place in the Midwest  that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later  because he had the same    he was Middle Eastern  and he had the same name as one of the      pilots  and that may or may not be true    I didn't think he was a liar  though. And  I think  if we look around the world  as well as the polar ice caps melting  human rights  which have been fought for  for many hundreds of years in some cases  are  also  eroding very fast  and that is something that we need to take a look at and  maybe  start campaigning for. I mean  here  too  one of our partners was at Van Jones and the Books Not Bars project    they have managed  with their footage in California to change the youth correction systems employed  and it's much    much    I think  more humane methods are being looked at  how you should lock up young kids  and that's questionable to start off. And as the story of Mr. Morales  just down the road  excuse me  Mr. Gabriel  would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit  No  not at all  no problem  take your time. But this  surely  whoever that man is  whatever he's done  this is cruel and unusual punishment. Anyway  WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world  with cameras  and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you. Text  You can say a jury is corrupt. You can say a person is lying. You can say you don't trust newspapers. But you can't say what you just saw never happened. Help WITNESS give cameras to the world. Shoot a video  expose injustice  reveal the truth  show us what's wrong with the world  and maybe we can help make it right. WITNESS. All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS. PG  WITNESS was born of technological innovation    in a sense the small  portable  DV cam was really what allowed it to come into being. And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world  so that groups can communicate much more effectively  campaign much more effectively  but now we have the wonderful possibility  which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it  because that is cheap  it's ubiquitous  and it's moving fast all around the world    and it's very exciting for us. And so  the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded  being seen  being watched  that they really know that they can be heard  that there would be a giant website  maybe  a little like Google Earth  and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going  for the world's inhabitants. In a way what this technology is allowing is  really  that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face  that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS or who's being beaten up  for the first time  and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture    if we can move that into these sort of fields  I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways. There could be a new movement growing up  rising from the ground  reaching for the light  and growing strong  just like a tree. Thank you. With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu    and we'll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today    I want to talk about the other pandemic  which is cardiovascular disease  diabetes  hypertension    all of which are completely preventable for at least    percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle. And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring  that people are starting to eat like us  and live like us  and die like us. And in one generation  for example  Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest. And in Africa  cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries. So there's a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people  and practice preventive medicine on a global scale. Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people    not only in this country  but also worldwide    than everything else combined  and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody. It's not only preventable  it's actually reversible. And for the last almost    years  we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle  using these very high tech  expensive  state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost interventions can be like    quantitative arteriography  before and after a year  and cardiac PET scans. We showed a few months ago    we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle  and    percent regression in the tumor growth  or inhibition of the tumor growth  compared to only nine percent in the control group. And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here  the prostate tumor activity is shown in red    you can see it diminishing after a year. Now there is an epidemic of obesity  two thirds of adults and    percent of kids. What's really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased    percent in the past    years  and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do. That's pitiful  and it's preventable. Now these are not election returns  these are the people    the number of the people who are obese by state  beginning in '    '    '      these are from the CDC website    '    '    '    '      you get a new category    '    '    '    '    '    '    '    '                  it gets worse. We're kind of devolving.  Laughter  Now what can we do about this  Well  you know  the diet that we've found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet. But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are  which is why they're starting to get sick like we are. So I've been working with a lot of the big food companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods  like    I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's  and PepsiCo  and ConAgra  and Safeway  and soon Del Monte  and they're finding that it's good business. The salads that you see at McDonald's came from the work    they're going to have an Asian salad. At Pepsi  two thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods. And so if we can do that  then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu. Thank you. I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television   I'm really getting into the Internet lately. I just wish it were more organized.  So ... If I controlled the Internet  you could auction your broken heart on eBay. Take the money  go to Amazon  buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to    call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language. If I were in charge of the Internet  you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings. Hang left at cranky  right at preoccupied  U turn on silent treatment  all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'. You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection. Some days  I'm as shallow as a baking pan  but I still stretch miles in all directions. If I owned the Internet  Napster  Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website. That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you're really just chattin' with your pals. Heck  if I ran the Web  you could email dead people. They would not email you back but you'd get an automated reply. Their name in your inbox it's all you wanted anyway. And a message saying   Hey  it's me. I miss you. Listen  you'll see being dead is dandy. Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy.  If I designed the Internet  childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard  with a ski pole for a sword  trashcan lid for a shield  shouting   I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges.  Now follow me  OK  Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit bath instructions. One  two  three. That links with hotdiggitydog.com. That is my grandfather. They take you to gruff ex cop on his fourth marriage.dad. He forms an attachment to kind of ditzy but still sends ginger snaps for Christmas.mom  who downloads the boy in the orchard  the emperor of oranges  who grows up to be me    the guy who usually goes too far. So if I were emperor of the Internet  I guess I'd still be mortal  huh  But at that point  I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office. I wouldn't need it. I'd be like some kind of Internet genius  and me  I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that    pop     I'd go wireless. Huh  Maybe Google would hire this. I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise  as wild and as organized as I think a modern day miracle oracle can get  but  ooh eee  you want to bet just how whack and un PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot shit hot shot god.net  I guess it's just like life. It is not a question of if you can    it's  do ya  We can interfere with the interface. We can make  You've got Hallelujah  the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on. You don't say a prayer. You don't write a psalm. You don't chant an  om.  You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of at dah da la dat da dah da la dat.com. Thank you  TED. This is really a two hour presentation I give to high school students  cut down to three minutes. And it all started one day on a plane  on my way to TED  seven years ago. And in the seat next to me was a high school student  a teenager  and she came from a really poor family. And she wanted to make something of her life  and she asked me a simple little question. She said   What leads to success   And I felt really badly  because I couldn't give her a good answer. So I get off the plane  and I come to TED. And I think  jeez  I'm in the middle of a room of successful people  So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed  and pass it on to kids  So here we are  seven years      interviews later  and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. And the first thing is passion. Freeman Thomas says   I'm driven by my passion.  TEDsters do it for love  they don't do it for money. Carol Coletta says   I would pay someone to do what I do.  And the interesting thing is  if you do it for love  the money comes anyway. Work  Rupert Murdoch said to me   It's all hard work. Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun.  Did he say fun  Rupert  Yes  TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard. I figured  they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics. Good  Alex Garden says   To be successful  put your nose down in something and get damn good at it.  There's no magic  it's practice  practice  practice. And it's focus. Norman Jewison said to me   I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing.  And push  David Gallo says   Push yourself. Physically  mentally  you've got to push  push  push.  You've got to push through shyness and self doubt. Goldie Hawn says   I always had self doubts. I wasn't good enough  I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it.  Now it's not always easy to push yourself  and that's why they invented mothers. Frank Gehry said to me   My mother pushed me.  Serve  Sherwin Nuland says   It was a privilege to serve as a doctor.  A lot of kids want to be millionaires. The first thing I say is   OK  well you can't serve yourself  you've got to serve others something of value. Because that's the way people really get rich.  Ideas  TEDster Bill Gates says   I had an idea  founding the first micro computer software company.  I'd say it was a pretty good idea. And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas    it's just doing some very simple things. And I give lots of evidence. Persist  Joe Kraus says   Persistence is the number one reason for our success.  You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap  Which of course means  Criticism  Rejection  Assholes and Pressure.  So  the answer to this question is simple  Pay       bucks and come to TED. Or failing that  do the eight things    and trust me  these are the big eight things that lead to success. Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews  Let me show you some images of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow. So  that's Kibera  the largest squatter community in Nairobi. This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Bombay  India  what's called Mumbai these days. This is Hosinia  the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro. And this is Sultanbelyi  which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul. They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow  the new urban world. Now  why do I say that  To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here  his name is Julius. And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera. So  I had been there almost three months  and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and Julius was tagging along  and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around  he grabbed my hand for support  which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing. They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly. And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi  and he's one of many. So  close to         people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas. That's  and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning  not almost  .  million people a week  but almost  .  million people a week but I'm a journalist  and we exaggerate  so almost  .  million people a week  close to    million people a year. And if you do the math  that's     people every minute. So  that'll be    in the    minutes that I'm given to talk here  between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities. And here are the statistics. Today    a billion squatters  one in six people on the planet.         two billion squatters  one in four people on the planet. And the estimate is that in       there'll be three billion squatters  better than one in three people on earth. So  these are the cities of the future  and we have to engage them. And I was thinking this morning of the good life  and before I show you the rest of my presentation  I'm going to violate TED rules here  and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can. Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is. So     The hut was made of corrugated metal  set on a concrete pad. It was a    by    cell. Armstrong O'Brian  Jr. shared it with three other men. Armstrong and his friends had no water    they bought it from a nearby tap owner    no toilet    the families in this compound shared a single pit latrine    and no sewers or sanitation. They did have electricity  but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires  and could only power one feeble bulb. This was Southland  a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi  Kenya. But it could've been anywhere in the city  because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.  .  million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services  no toilets  no rights.  Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation  they paid       shillings in rent  about    bucks a month  a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown  and they could not afford to be late with the money. 'In case you owe one month  the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things ' Armstrong said. 'Not one month  one day ' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu  who was cooking ugali  the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country  cut into the conversation. They called their landlord a Wabenzi  meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a Mercedes Benz. Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes  the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof  and we perspired as we ate.  After we finished  Armstrong straightened his tie  put on a wool sports jacket  and we headed out into the glare. Outside a mound of garbage formed the border between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata. It was perhaps eight feet tall     feet long  and    feet wide. And it was set in a wider watery ooze. As we passed  two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash. They couldn't have been more than five or six years old. They were barefoot  and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile. I thought they might be playing King of the Hill  but I was wrong. Once atop the pile  one of the boys lowered his shorts  squatted  and defecated. The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs. When    families        people or so    share a single latrine  a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing. But it stood in jarring contrast to something Armstrong had said as we were eating    that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.  For Armstrong  Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions. Instead  the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could  freedom. 'This place is very addictive ' he had said. 'It's a simple life  but nobody is restricting you. Nobody is controlling what you do. Once you have stayed here  you cannot go back.' He meant back beyond that mountain of trash  back in the legal city  of legal buildings  with legal leases and legal rights. 'Once you have stayed here ' he said  'you can stay for the rest of your life.'  So  he has hope  and this is where these communities start. This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera  little more than a stick and mud hut next to a garbage heap. This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay  India. This is home improvement  putting plastic tarps on your roof. This is in Rio de Janeiro  and it's getting a bit better  right  We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs  and plaster over the brick  some color  and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi  and it's getting even better. He's got a fence  he scavenged a door  he's got new tile on the roof. And then you get Rocinha and you can see that it's getting even better. The buildings here are multi story. They develop    you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other  room  after room  after room. And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories  and they sell their loggia or roof rights  and someone else builds on top of their building  and then that person sells the roof rights  and someone else builds on top of their building. All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick. And then you get Sultanbelyi  in Turkey  where it's even built to a higher level of design. The crud in the front is mattress stuffing  and you see that all over Turkey. People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs. But the green building  on behind  you can see that the top floor is not occupied  so people are building with the possibility of expansion. And it's built to a pretty high standard of design. And then you finally get squatter homes like this  which is built on the suburban model. Hey  that's a single family home in the squatter community. That's also in Istanbul  Turkey. They're quite vital places  these communities. This is the main drag of Rocinha  the Estrada da Gavea  and there's a bus route that runs through it  lots of people out on the street. These communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities. They have more things going on in them. This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a  beco     these are how you get around the community. It's on very steep ground. They're built on the hills  inland from the beaches in Rio  and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions. So  that's just a rock in the hillside. And these becos are normally very crowded  and people hump furniture up them  or refrigerators up them  all sorts of things. Beer is all carried in on your shoulders. Beer is a very important thing in Brazil. This is commerce in Kenya  right along the train tracks  so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way. This is a marketplace  also in Kenya  Toi Market  lots of dealers  in almost everything you want to buy. Those green things in the foreground are mangoes. This is a shopping street in Kibera  and you can see that there's a soda dealer  a health clinic  two beauty salons  a bar  two grocery stores  and a church  and more. It's a typical downtown street  it just happens to be self built. This here  on the right hand side  is what's called a    if you look at the fine print under the awning    it's a hotel. And what hotel means  in Kenya and India  is an eating place. So  that's a restaurant. People steal electrical power    this is Rio. People tap in and they have thieves who are called  grillos  or  crickets   and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood. People burn trash to get rid of the garbage  and they dig their own sewer channels. Talk about more plastic bags than plankton. And sometimes they have natural trash disposal. And when they have more money they cement their streets  and they put in sewers and good water pipes  and stuff like that. This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place  and that little hut right there has a pump in it  and that's what people do  they steal electricity  they install a pump and they tap into the water main  and pump water up to their houses. So  the question is how do you go from the mud hut village  to the more developed city  to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi  I say there are two things. One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted. That does not necessarily mean property rights  and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question  because property rights create a lot of complications. They're most often sold to people  and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt  and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt. There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don't work in these cases  but they do need security of tenure. And they need access to politics  and that can mean two things. That can mean community organizing from below  but it can also mean possibilities from above. And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable. Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters. One is that    it's called  gecekondu  in Turkish  which means  built overnight   and if you build your house overnight in Turkey  you can't be evicted without due process of law  if they don't catch you during the night. And the second aspect is that once you have       people in the community  you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub municipality. And when you're a legal sub municipality  you suddenly have politics. You're allowed to have an elected government  collect taxes  provide municipal services  and that's exactly what they do. So  these are the civic leaders of the future. The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa. She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai. That's Sureka Gundi  she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median. They're very outspoken. They're very active. They can be community leaders. This woman is Nine  which means  grandma  in Turkish. And there were three old ladies who lived in    that's her self built house behind her    and they've lived there for    or    years  and they are the backbone of the community there. This is Richard Muthama Peter  and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera. He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood  and the people in the neighborhood  and is a great resource in the community. And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio  the fruit merchant with his two kids here  and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know. The future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people. So  I think the message I take  from what I read from the book  from what Armstrong said  and from all these people  is that these are neighborhoods. The issue is not urban poverty. The issue is not the larger  over arching thing. The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods    this is a legitimate form of urban development    and that cities have to engage these residents  because they are building the cities of the future. Thank you very much. What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world. I'm not going to talk about  The Skeptical Environmentalist     probably that's also a good choice. But I am going talk about  what are the big problems in the world  And I must say  before I go on  I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that. So get out your pen and paper. Bottom line is  there is a lot of problems out there in the world. I'm just going to list some of them. There are     million people starving. There's a billion people without clean drinking water. Two billion people without sanitation. There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS. The lists go on and on. There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change    so on. There are many  many problems out there. In an ideal world  we would solve them all  but we don't. We don't actually solve all problems. And if we do not  the question I think we need to ask ourselves    and that's why it's on the economy session    is to say  if we don't do all things  we really have to start asking ourselves  which ones should we solve first  And that's the question I'd like to ask you. If we had say     billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world  where should we spend it  We identified    of the biggest challenges in the world  and I will just briefly read them  climate change  communicable diseases  conflicts  education  financial instability  governance and corruption  malnutrition and hunger  population migration  sanitation and water  and subsidies and trade barriers. We believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world. The obvious question would be to ask  what do you think are the biggest things  Where should we start on solving these problems  But that's a wrong problem to ask. That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January. But of course  there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems. Because we can't solve problems. Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die. But we don't have a technology to solve that  right  So the point is not to prioritize problems  but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems. And that would be    of course that gets a little more complicated. To climate change that would be like Kyoto. To communicable diseases  it might be health clinics or mosquito nets. To conflicts  it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces  and so on. The point that I would like to ask you to try to do  is just in    seconds    and I know this is in a sense an impossible task    write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities. And also    and that's  of course  where economics gets evil    to put down what are the things we should not do  first. What should be at the bottom of the list  Please  just take    seconds  perhaps talk to your neighbor  and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world's biggest issues. The amazing part of this process    and of course  I mean  I would love to    I only have    minutes  I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time  right  I'd love to go into  and get you to think about this process  and that's actually what we did. And I also strongly encourage you  and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards  to think about  how do we actually prioritize  Of course  you have to ask yourself  why on Earth was such a list never done before  And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable. Nobody wants to do this. Of course  every organization would love to be on the top of such a list. But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list. And since there are many more not number one spots on the list than there is number ones  it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list. We've had the U.N. for almost    years  yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world  and said  which of them should we do first  So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing    any decision is a prioritization  so of course we are still prioritizing  if only implicitly    and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization  and went in and talked about it. So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have  for a very long time  had a situation when we've had a menu of choices. There are many  many things we can do out there  but we've not had the prices  nor the sizes. We have not had an idea. Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card  but you have no idea what the price is. You know  you have a pizza  you've no idea what the price is. It could be at one dollar  it could be       dollars. It could be a family size pizza  it could be a very individual size pizza  right  We'd like to know these things. And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do    to try to put prices on these issues. And so basically  this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process. We got    of the world's best economists  three in each area. So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change. What can we do  What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that  Likewise in communicable diseases. Three of the world's top experts saying  what can we do  What would be the price  What should we do about it  and what will be the outcome  And so on. Then we had some of the world's top economists  eight of the world's top economists  including three Nobel Laureates  meet in Copenhagen in May     . We called them the  dream team.  The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them the Real Madrid of economics. That works very well in Europe  but it doesn't really work over here. And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list. And then you ask  why economists  And of course  I'm very happy you asked that question     Laughter     because that's a very good question. The point is  of course  if you want to know about malaria  you ask a malaria expert. If you want to know about climate  you ask a climatologist. But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first  you can't ask either of them  because that's not what they do. That is what economists do. They prioritize. They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying  which one should we do first  and which one should we do afterwards  So this is the list  and this is the one I'd like to share with you. Of course  you can also see it on the website  and we'll also talk about it more  I'm sure  as the day goes on. They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects    basically  projects where if you invest a dollar  you get less than a dollar back. Then there's fair projects  good projects and very good projects. And of course  it's the very good projects we should start doing. I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects. These were the bad projects. As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change. This offends a lot of people  and that's probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn't come back  either. And I'd like to talk about that  because that's really curious. Why is it it came up  And I'll actually also try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down. The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto    or doing something more than Kyoto    is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient. It's not saying that global warming is not happening. It's not saying that it's not a big problem. But it's saying that what we can do about it is very little  at a very high cost. What they basically show us  the average of all macroeconomic models  is that Kyoto  if everyone agreed  would cost about     billion dollars a year. That's a substantial amount of money. That's two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year. Yet it would do very little good. All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in     . So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in      can wait until     . Which is a little good  but not very much good. So the idea here really is to say  well  we've spent a lot of money doing a little good. And just to give you a sense of reference  the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount  for about    billion dollars a year  we could solve all major basic problems in the world. We could give clean drinking water  sanitation  basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet. So we have to ask ourselves  do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good  Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good  And that is really why it becomes a bad project. It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world  we wouldn't want to do it. But it's to say  when we don't  it's just simply not our first priority. The fair projects    notice I'm not going to comment on all these    but communicable diseases  scale of basic health services    just made it  simply because  yes  scale of basic health services is a great thing. It would do a lot of good  but it's also very  very costly. Again  what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation. If you look at the good projects  a lot of sanitation and water projects came in. Again  sanitation and water is incredibly important  but it also costs a lot of infrastructure. So I'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world. The fourth best problem is malaria    dealing with malaria. The incidence of malaria is about a couple of  million  people get infected every year. It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations. If we invested about    billion dollars over the next four years  we could bring that incidence down to half. We could avoid about         people dying  but perhaps more importantly  we could avoid about a  million  people getting infected every year. We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with    of course  in the long run  also to deal with global warming. This third best one was free trade. Basically  the model showed that if we could get free trade  and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe  we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about       billion dollars a year  half of which would accrue to the Third World. Again  the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty  very radically fast  in about two to five years. That would be the third best thing we could do. The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition. Not just malnutrition in general  but there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition  namely  the lack of micronutrients. Basically  about half of the world's population is lacking in iron  zinc  iodine and vitamin A. If we invest about    billion dollars  we could make a severe inroad into that problem. That would be the second best investment that we could do. And the very best project would be to focus on HIV AIDS. Basically  if we invest    billion dollars over the next eight years  we could avoid    new million cases of HIV AIDS. Again  what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV AIDS. One is treatment  the other one is prevention. And again  in an ideal world  we would do both. But in a world where we don't do either  or don't do it very well  we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first. And treatment is much  much more expensive than prevention. So basically  what this focuses on is saying  we can do a lot more by investing in prevention. Basically for the amount of money that we spend  we can do X amount of good in treatment  and    times as much good in prevention. So again  what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment  at first rate. What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities. I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say  did you get it right  Or did you get close to what we came up with here  Well  of course  one of the things is climate change again. I find a lot of people find it very  very unlikely that we should do that. We should also do climate change  if for no other reason  simply because it's such a big problem. But of course  we don't do all problems. There are many problems out there in the world. And what I want to make sure of is  if we actually focus on problems  that we focus on the right ones. The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good. And I think  actually    Thomas Schelling  one of the participants in the dream team  he put it very  very well. One of things that people forget  is that in     years  when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be  people will be much  much richer. Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N. estimate that the average person in the developing world in      will be about as rich as we are today. Much more likely  they will be two to four times richer than we are. And of course  we'll be even richer than that. But the point is to say  when we talk about saving people  or helping people in Bangladesh in       we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi. We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy. And so the real point  of course  is to say  do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little      years from now  a fairly rich Dutch guy  Or do we want to help real poor people  right now  in Bangladesh  who really need the help  and whom we can help very  very cheaply  Or as Schelling put it  imagine if you were a rich    as you will be    a rich Chinese  a rich Bolivian  a rich Congolese  in       thinking back on       and saying   How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change  and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather  whom they could have helped so much more  and who needed the help so much more   So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight. Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem. Of course  that's mainly because climate change has good pictures. We have  you know   The Day After Tomorrow     it looks great  right  It's a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it  right  but don't expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie digging latrines in Tanzania or something.  Laughter  It just doesn't make for as much of a movie. So in many ways  I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems. To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good. It's not about making things that have the most media attention  but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good. The other objections  I think  that are important to say  is that I'm somehow    or we are somehow    positing a false choice. Of course  we should do all things  in an ideal world    I would certainly agree. I think we should do all things  but we don't. In       the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did  right now  than in       on the developing world. Since then our aid has halved. So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems. Likewise  people are also saying  but what about the Iraq war  You know  we spend     billion dollars    why don't we spend that on doing good in the world  I'm all for that. If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that  that's fine. But the point  of course  is still to say  if you get another     billion dollars  we still want to spend that in the best possible way  don't we  So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities. I should just mention briefly  is this really the right list that we got out  You know  when you ask the world's best economists  you inevitably end up asking old  white American men. And they're not necessarily  you know  great ways of looking at the entire world. So we actually invited    young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem. The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university  and they spoke English. The majority of them were  first  from developing countries. They had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion  and they certainly did  to come up with their own lists. And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar    with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom. We've done this many other times. There's been many other seminars and university students  and different things. They all come out with very much the same list. And that gives me great hope  really  in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities  and saying  what is the important thing in the world  Of course  in an ideal world  again we'd love to do everything. But if we don't do it  then we can start thinking about where should we start  I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process. We did it in       and we hope to assemble many more people  getting much better information for           . Map out the right path for the world    but also to start thinking about political triage. To start thinking about saying   Let's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost  not the things that we don't know how to do  but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good  at very low cost  right now.  At the end of the day  you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these  but we have to be honest and frank about saying  if there's some things we do  there are other things we don't do. If we worry too much about some things  we end by not worrying about other things. So I hope this will help us make better priorities  and think about how we better work for the world. Thank you. A fact came out of MIT  couple of years ago. Ken Hale  who's a linguist  said that of the       languages spoken on Earth right now        aren't spoken by the children. So that in one generation  we're going to halve our cultural diversity. He went on to say that every two weeks  an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture. So an entire philosophy  a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries  goes away. And this happens every two weeks. So for the last    years  since my dental experience  I have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people. What I'd like to do right now is share some of those stories with you. This is Tamdin. She is a    year old nun. She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country. And when I met her  she had just taken a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa  the capital of Tibet  into Nepal  across to India       days    to meet her leader  the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala  India. So I took this picture three days after she arrived  and she had this beat up pair of tennis shoes on  with her toes sticking out. And she crossed in March  and there's a lot of snow at        feet in March. This is Paldin. Paldin is a    year old monk. And he spent    years in prison. His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising  when the Dalai Lama had to leave Tibet. And he was beaten  starved  tortured    lost all his teeth while in prison. And when I met him  he was a kind gentle old man. And it really impressed me    I met him two weeks after he got out of prison    that he went through that experience  and ended up with the demeanor that he had. So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people  and I'd spent about five weeks there  and I was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet into Dharamsala. And it just so happened  on the fifth week  there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama. And I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns  many of which I had just interviewed  and heard their stories  and I watched their faces  and they gave us a little FM radio  and we could listen to the translation of his teachings. And what he said was  treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels  because it's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment. That hit me so hard  telling these people that had been through this experience. So  two months later  I went into Tibet  and I started interviewing the people there  taking my photographs. That's what I do. I interview and do portraits. And this is a little girl. I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple. And I'd snuck in    because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet    it's the quickest way you can get arrested. So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet sized pictures of the Dalai Lama  and I would hand them out. And when I gave them to the people  they'd either hold them to their heart  or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there. And this is    well  at the time    I did this    years ago    that was    years after the Dalai Lama had left. So I was going in  interviewing these people and doing their portraits. This is Jigme and her sister  Sonam. And they live up on the Chang Tang  the Tibetan Plateau  way in the western part of the country. This is at        feet. And they had just come down from the high pastures  at        feet. Same thing  gave her a picture  she held it up to her forehead. And I usually hand out Polaroids when I do these  because I'm setting up lights  and checking my lights  and when I showed her her Polaroid  she screamed and ran into her tent. This is Tenzin Gyatso  he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two  out in a peasant's house  way out in the middle of nowhere. At the age of four  he was installed as the   th Dalai Lama. As a teenager  he faced the invasion of his country  and had to deal with it    he was the leader of the country. Eight years later  when they discovered there was a plot to kill him  they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback  and took the same trip that Tamdin did. And he's never been back to his country since. And if you think about this man     years later  still sticking to this non violent response to a severe political and human rights issue. And the young people  young Tibetans  are starting to say  listen  this doesn't work. You know  violence as a political tool is all the rage right now. And he still is holding this line. So this is our icon to non violence in our world    one of our living icons. This is another leader of his people. This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon. And Moi is    years old. And this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon    oil was discovered in     . And in this period of time    since that time    as much oil  or twice as much oil as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident  was spilled in this little area of the Amazon  and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move. And Moi belongs to the Huaorani tribe  and they're known as very fierce  they're known as  auca.  And they've managed to keep out the seismologists and the oil workers with spears and blowguns. And we spent    I was with a team    two weeks with these guys out in the jungle watching them hunt. This was on a monkey hunt  hunting with curare tipped darts. And the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible. They could hear things  smell things  see things I couldn't see. And I couldn't even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts. This is Yadira  and Yadira is five years old. She's in a tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani. And her tribe has had to move three times in the last    years because of the oil spills. And we never hear about that. And the latest infraction against these people is  as part of Plan Colombia  we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up  whatever it is    we're defoliating thousands of acres of the Ecuadorian Amazon in our war on drugs. And these people are the people who take the brunt of it. This is Mengatoue. He's the shaman of the Huaorani  and he said to us  you know  I'm an older man now  I'm getting tired  you know  I'm tired of spearing these oil workers. I wish they would just go away. And I was    I usually travel alone when I do my work  but I did this    I hosted a program for Discovery  and when I went down with the team  I was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people  especially into the Huaorani  deep into the Huaorani tribe. And as it turned out  these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in with the locals. One of the things I did just before         August of         I took my son  Dax  who was    at the time  and I took him to Pakistan. Because at first I wanted    you know  I've taken him on a couple of trips  but I wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less. I wanted him to get an experience in the Islamic world and I also wanted him to    I was going there to work with a group  do a story on a group called the Kalash  that are a group of animists        animists  that live    very small area    surrounded by Islam    there's       of these Kalash left  they're incredible people. So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them  drumming and dancing. And he brought a soccer ball  and we had soccer every night in this little village. And then we went up and met their shaman. By the way  Mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well. And this is John Doolikahn  who's the shaman of the Kalash. And he's up in the mountains  right on the border with Afghanistan. In fact  on that other side is the area  Tora Bora  the area where Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area. And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn. And the shaman    I did a whole series on shamanism  which is an interesting phenomenon. But around the world  they go into trance in different ways  and in Pakistan  the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves and they sacrifice an animal  pour the blood of the animal on the leaves and then inhale the smoke. And they're all praying to the mountain gods as they go into trance. You know  getting kids used to different realities  I think  is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day    having a curriculum where they study different religions  just to make a mental flexibility  give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems    I think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place. And all the security issues they cause us. So  one thing we did five years ago  we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the United States. So we first hooked up a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle. We now have    sites. We have one in Kathmandu  Nepal  Dharamsala  India  Takaungu  Kenya    Takaungu is one third Christian  one third Muslim and one third animist  the community is    Ollantaytambo  Peru  and Arctic Village  Alaska. This is Daniel  he's one of our students in Arctic Village  Alaska. He lives in this log cabin    no running water  no heat other than    no windows and high speed Internet connection. And this is    I see this rolling out all over    this is our site in Ollantaytambo  Peru  four years ago  where they first saw their first computers  now they have computers in their classrooms. And the way we've done this    we teach digital storytelling to these kids. And we have them tell stories about issues in their community in their community that they care about. And this is in Peru  where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up. And the way we do it is  we do it in workshops  and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling  and have them work with the kids. And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in  and this has worked the best. So our dream is to bring teenagers together  so they'll have a community service experience as well as a cross cultural experience  as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure. This is teaching Photoshop in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala. We have the website  where the kids all get their homepage. This is all their movies. We've got about    movies that these kids have made  and they're quite incredible. The one I want to show you    after we get them to make the movies  we have a night where we show the movies to the community. And this is in Takaungu    we've got a generator and a digital projector  and we're projecting it up against a barn  and showing one of the movies that they made. And if you get a chance  you can go to our website  and you'll see the incredible work these kids do. The other thing  I wanted to give indigenous people a voice. That was one of the big motivating factors. But the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country. National Geographic just did a Roper Study of    to    year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries. It was a two million dollar study. United States came in second to last in geographic knowledge.    percent of the kids couldn't find Afghanistan or Iraq on a map     percent couldn't find India     percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean. And this is a study that was just done a couple of years ago. So what I'd like to show you now  in the couple of minutes I have left  is a film that a student made in Guatemala. We just had a workshop in Guatemala. A week before we got to the workshop  a massive landslide  caused by Hurricane Stan  last October  came in and buried     people alive in their village. And this kid lived in the village    he wasn't there at the time    and this is the little movie he put together about that. And he hadn't seen a computer before we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and    yeah  we can play it. This is an old Mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather. Thank you very much. You know  one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways  who still feel their past in the wind  touch it in stones polished by rain  taste it in the bitter leaves of plants. Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way  or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning  or that in the Himalaya  the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma  is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology  and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense  but is just one model of reality  the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made  albeit successfully  many generations ago. And of course  we all share the same adaptive imperatives. We're all born. We all bring our children into the world. We go through initiation rites. We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death  so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing  we all dance  we all have art. But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song  the rhythm of the dance in every culture. And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo  or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti  or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya  the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes  or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara    this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago    or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma  Everest  the goddess mother of the world. All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being  other ways of thinking  other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth. And this is an idea  if you think about it  can only fill you with hope. Now  together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet  and is as important to the well being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere. And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere  and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams  myths  ideas  inspirations  intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness. The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy. It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species. And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded  so too is the ethnosphere    and  if anything  at a far greater rate. No biologists  for example  would dare suggest that    percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true  and yet that    the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity    scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity. And the great indicator of that  of course  is language loss. When each of you in this room were born  there were       languages spoken on the planet. Now  a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules. A language is a flash of the human spirit. It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world. Every language is an old growth forest of the mind  a watershed  a thought  an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities. And of those       languages  as we sit here today in Monterey  fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children. They're no longer being taught to babies  which means  effectively  unless something changes  they're already dead. What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence  to be the last of your people to speak your language  to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children  And yet  that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks  because every two weeks  some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue. And I know there's some of you who say   Well  wouldn't it be better  wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language   And I say   Great  let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese. Let's make it Kogi.  And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language. And so  what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere  a brief journey through the ethnosphere  to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost. Now  there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say  different ways of being   I really do mean different ways of being. Take  for example  this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon  the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes. Now  this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend. They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called  linguistic exogamy   you must marry someone who speaks a different language. And this is all rooted in the mythological past  yet the curious thing is in these long houses  where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage  you never hear anyone practicing a language. They simply listen and then begin to speak. Or  one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with  the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador  an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in     . In       five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake. They dropped from the air   x    glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures  forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives. They picked up these photographs from the forest floor  tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure  found nothing  and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil  so they speared the five missionaries to death. But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders. They speared each other.    percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other. We traced genealogies back eight generations  and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it  they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old  so we speared him anyway.  Laughter  But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing. Their hunters could smell animal urine at    paces and tell you what species left it behind. In the early '  s  I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti  infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes  and securing the poison used to make zombies. In order to make sense out of sensation  of course  I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult. On the contrary  it's a complex metaphysical worldview. It's interesting. If I asked you to name the great religions of the world  what would you say  Christianity  Islam  Buddhism  Judaism  whatever. There's always one continent left out  the assumption being that sub Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs. Well  of course  they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era. But  what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead. So  the living give birth to the spirits. The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water  responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living  so that for that brief shining moment  the acolyte becomes the god. That's why the Voodooists like to say that  You white people go to church and speak about God. We dance in the temple and become God.  And because you are possessed  you are taken by the spirit    how can you be harmed  So you see these astonishing demonstrations  Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity  a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation. Now  of all the peoples that I've ever been with  the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia. Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia  in the wake of the conquest  these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain. In a bloodstained continent  these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish. To this day  they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary. The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four  sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for    years  two nine year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb  now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother. And for this entire time  they are inculturated into the values of their society  values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic    or we might say the ecological    balance. And at the end of this amazing initiation  one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives  at the age of     they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape  suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back and says   You see  It's really as I've told you. It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect.  They call themselves the  elder brothers  and they say we  who are the younger brothers  are the ones responsible for destroying the world. Now  this level of intuition becomes very important. Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape  we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the  noble savage   which is an idea racist in its simplicity  or alternatively  we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are. Well  indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia. There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet  but they have  nevertheless  through time and ritual  forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self consciously close to it  but on a far subtler intuition  the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness. Now  what does that mean  It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined. Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant. What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world. I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut. That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world  spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation. Now  if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities  you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here. It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April. This is ayahuasca  which many of you have heard about  the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire. What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation  but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources  on the one hand  this woody liana which has in it a series of beta carbolines  harmine  harmaline  mildly hallucinogenic    to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness    but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis. This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines  very close to brain serotonin  dimethyltryptamine    methoxydimethyltryptamine. If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses  that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine. To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity.  Laughter  It doesn't create the distortion of reality  it creates the dissolution of reality. In fact  I used to argue with my professor  Richard Evan Shultes    who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the     s    I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination.  Laughter  But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase. They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO. Now  the fascinating things are that the beta carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question. How  in a flora of        species of vascular plants  do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way  created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts  Well  we use that great euphemism   trial and error   which is exposed to be meaningless. But you ask the Indians  and they say   The plants talk to us.  Well  what does that mean  This tribe  the Cofan  has    varieties of ayahuasca  all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest  all of which are referable to our eye as one species. And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say   I thought you knew something about plants. I mean  don't you know anything   And I said   No.  Well  it turns out you take each of the    varieties in the night of a full moon  and it sings to you in a different key. Now  that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard  but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens.  Laughter  Now    the problem    the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world  meaning our world  moves on. Well  the truth is the   th century      years from now  is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations  but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now  the problem isn't change. All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life. And the problem is not technology itself. The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy. It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power  the crude face of domination. Wherever you look around the world  you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away  these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to  whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan    a nomadic people from Southeast Asia  from Sarawak    a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago  and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers  where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea  where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest    or  in the case of the Yanomami  it's the disease entities that have come in  in the wake of the discovery of gold. Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet  where I'm doing a lot of research recently  you'll see it's a crude face of political domination. You know  genocide  the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned  but ethnocide  the destruction of people's way of life  is not only not condemned  it's universally  in many quarters  celebrated as part of a development strategy. And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level. I once travelled       miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague  and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about        sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes   .  million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution. This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama. That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion. His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal. His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy. He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him. The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp. One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao  and for that transgression  she was given seven years of hard labor. The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear  but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold. And in the end  then  it really comes down to a choice  do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity  Margaret Mead  the great anthropologist  said  before she died  that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought  but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities. And it's humbling to remember that our species has  perhaps  been around for           years. The Neolithic Revolution    which gave us agriculture  at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed  the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood  we created hierarchy specialization surplus    is only        years ago. The modern industrial world as we know it is barely     years old. Now  that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human  they respond with        different voices. And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are  a fully conscious species  fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism. This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people  and this man  Olayuk  told me a marvelous story of his grandfather. The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people  and during the     s  to establish our sovereignty  we forced them into settlements. This old man's grandfather refused to go. The family  fearful for his life  took away all of his weapons  all of his tools. Now  you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold  they took advantage of it. The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide. So  this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing. He simply slipped outside  pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze  he shaped it into the form of a blade. He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid  he butchered a dog with it. He skinned the dog and improvised a harness  took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled  harnessed up an adjacent dog  and disappeared over the ice floes  shit knife in belt. Talk about getting by with nothing.  Laughter  And this  in many ways    is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world. The Canadian government in April of      gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together. It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut. It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources. An amazing example of how a nation state can seek restitution with its people. And finally  in the end  I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet  to realize that they're not remote at all. They're homelands of somebody. They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us  the dreams of these children  like the dreams of our own children  become part of the naked geography of hope. So  what we're trying to do at the National Geographic  finally  is  we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything. We think that polemics    we think that polemics are not persuasive  but we think that storytelling can change the world  and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get    million hits on our website every month.     nations carry our television channel. Our magazines are read by millions. And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen  and hopefully  therefore  embrace gradually  one by one  the central revelation of anthropology  that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way  that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural  pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well being. Thank you very much. If you take        people at random        have something in common  their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface. The odd one out is an astronomer  and I am one of that strange breed. My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer  and then as a worried member of the human race. But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution. And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning  to set our Earth in a cosmic context. And let me just run through a few slides. This was the impact that happened last week on a comet. If they'd sent a nuke  it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last Monday. So that's another project for NASA. That's Mars from the European Mars Express  and at New Year. This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan  Saturn's giant moon. It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down. That looks like a coastline. It is indeed  but the ocean is liquid methane    the temperature minus     degrees centigrade. If we go beyond our solar system  we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light. Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it. And we can see places where stars are forming  like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying. In six billion years  the sun will look like that. And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion  leaving remnants like that. On a still bigger scale  we see entire galaxies of stars. We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled. And to the cosmologist  these galaxies are just the atoms  as it were  of the large scale universe. This picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about     patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky. Through a small telescope  this would look quite blank  but you see here hundreds of little  faint smudges. Each is a galaxy  fully like ours or Andromeda  which looks so small and faint because its light has taken    billion light years to get to us. The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them. There's scant chance of life there    that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron  the building blocks of planets and of life. We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang    a hot  dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang turn into our complex cosmos  I'm going to show you a movie simulation    powers of    faster than real time  which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out. But you see  as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom  you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small  dense irregularities  and structures develop. And we'll end up after    billion years with something looking rather like our own universe. And we compare simulated universes like that    I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk    with what we actually see in the sky. Well  we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang  but we still don't know what banged and why it banged. That's a challenge for   st century science. If my research group had a logo  it would be this picture here  an ouroboros  where you see the micro world on the left    the world of the quantum    and on the right the large scale universe of planets  stars and galaxies. We know our universes are united though    links between left and right. The everyday world is determined by atoms  how they stick together to make molecules. Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together. And  as we've learned in the last few years  galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so called dark matter  particles in huge swarms  far smaller even than atomic nuclei. But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top. The micro world of the quantum is understood. On the right hand side  gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that. But the unfinished business for   st century science is to link together cosmos and micro world with a unified theory    symbolized  as it were  gastronomically at the top of that picture.  Laughter  And until we have that synthesis  we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom  quantum effects could shake everything. And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small  which we don't yet have. One idea  incidentally    and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on    is that our Big Bang was not the only one. One idea is that our three dimensional universe may be embedded in a high dimensional space  just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper. You can imagine ants on one of them thinking it's a two dimensional universe  not being aware of another population of ants on the other. So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours  but we're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension  and we're imprisoned in our three. And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe    the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture. Bottom right depicts our universe  which on the horizon is not beyond that  but even that is just one bubble  as it were  in some vaster reality. Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems  one galaxy to many galaxies  we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang  perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying an immense variety of properties. Well  let's go back to this picture. There's one challenge symbolized at the top  but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom. You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small  but we want to understand the very complex. And the most complex things are ourselves  midway between atoms and stars. We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of. We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure. We clearly have to be large  compared to atoms  to have layer upon layer of complex structure. We clearly have to be small  compared to stars and planets    otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact  we are midway. It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us. The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is    kilograms  within a factor of two of the mass of each person here. Well  most of you anyway. The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all  greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right. And it's this science  which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world  but also transforming our world faster than ever. And more than that  it's engendering new kinds of change. And I now move on to the second part of my talk  and the book  Our Final Century  was mentioned. If I was not a self effacing Brit  I would mention the book myself  and I would add that it's available in paperback. And in America it was called  Our Final Hour  because Americans like instant gratification. But my theme is that in this century  not only has science changed the world faster than ever  but in new and different ways. Targeted drugs  genetic modification  artificial intelligence  perhaps even implants into our brains  may change human beings themselves. And human beings  their physique and character  has not changed for thousands of years. It may change this century. It's new in our history. And the human impact on the global environment    greenhouse warming  mass extinctions and so forth    is unprecedented  too. And so  this makes this coming century a challenge. Bio  and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects  while  nonetheless  reducing pressure on energy and resources. But they will have a dark side. In our interconnected world  novel technology could empower just one fanatic  or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses  to trigger some kind on disaster. Indeed  catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure    error rather than terror. And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence. In fact  some years ago  Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over  etc. I don't go along with all that  but it's interesting that he had a simple solution. It was what he called  fine grained relinquishment.  He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits. Now  that's absurdly naive for two reasons. First  any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones. And also  when a scientist makes a discovery  he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be. And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science. We have to accept that there will be hazards. And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post War era  post World War II  when the nuclear scientists who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb  in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers. And they were inspired not by the young Einstein  who did the great work in relativity  but by the old Einstein  the icon of poster and t shirt  who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws. He was premature. But he was a moral compass    an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control. And perhaps the greatest living person is someone I'm privileged to know  Joe Rothblatt. Equally untidy office there  as you can see. He's    years old  and he founded the Pugwash movement. He persuaded Einstein  as his last act  to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell. And he sets an example of the concerned scientist. And I think to harness science optimally  to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed  we need latter day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt. We need not just campaigning physicists  but we need biologists  computer experts and environmentalists as well. And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service  or company employees subject to commercial pressure. I wrote my book   Our Final Century   as a scientist  just a general scientist. But there's one respect  I think  in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective  and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future. The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture    outside the American Bible Belt  anyway    but most people  even those who are familiar with evolution  aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead. The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years  but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out. On that schematic picture  a sort of time lapse picture  we're halfway. And it'll be another six billion before that happens  and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized. There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there  experiencing the sun's demise  but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria. The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go  here on Earth and probably far beyond. So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our Earth and beyond. If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year  say from January when it was made to December  the   st century would be a quarter of a second in June    a tiny fraction of the year. But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective  our century is very  very special  the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet. As I should have shown this earlier  it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun  it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria. When Einstein died in       one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by Herblock in the Washington Post. The plaque reads   Albert Einstein lived here.  And I'd like to end with a vignette  as it were  inspired by this image. We've been familiar for    years with this image  the fragile beauty of land  ocean and clouds  contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints. But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar  not just for    years  but for the entire  .  billion year history of our Earth. What would they have seen  Over nearly all that immense time  Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually. The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super eruptions. Apart from those brief traumas  nothing happens suddenly. The continental landmasses drifted around. Ice cover waxed and waned. Successions of new species emerged  evolved and became extinct. But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history  the last one millionth part  a few thousand years  the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This signaled the start of agriculture. Change has accelerated as human populations rose. Then other things happened even more abruptly. Within just    years    that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age    the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise  and ominously fast. The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves    the total output from all TV and cell phones and radar transmissions. And something else happened. Metallic objects    albeit very small ones  a few tons at most    escaped into orbit around the Earth. Some journeyed to the moons and planets. A race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years. But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earth's life  These human induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed  If they continued their vigil  what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years  Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future  Or will the biosphere stabilize  Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth spawn new oases  a post human life elsewhere  The science done by the young Einstein will continue as long as our civilization  but for civilization to survive  we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein    humane  global and farseeing. And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth  far beyond the Earth as depicted here. Thank you very much. I've got apparently    minutes to convince you that history has a direction  an arrow  that in some fundamental sense  it's good  that the arrow points to something positive. Now  when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk       that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting. It was before the avian flu had reached Europe. It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election  eliciting various counter measures by Israel. And to be honest  if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk  the apocalypse would be unfolding       I might have said   Is it okay if I talk about something else   But I didn't  OK. So we're here. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can. I've got to warn you  the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle  sometimes even elusive. The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring    I mean  there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way I try to uplift  so if grim inspiration       if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms  that is  I'm afraid  the most you can hope for. OK  today    that's if I succeed. I'll see what I can do. OK  Now  in one sense  the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial. If you're just talking about social structure  OK  clearly that's gotten more complex a little over the last        years    has reached higher and higher levels. And in fact  that's actually sustaining a long standing trend that predates human beings  OK  that biological evolution was doing for us. Because what happened in the beginning  this stuff encases itself in a cell  then cells start hanging out together in societies. Eventually they get so close  they form multicellular organisms  then you get complex multicellular organisms  they form societies. But then at some point  one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff  which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution  cultural evolution. And amazingly  that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity. By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas. A lot of you have heard the term  memes.  The evolution of technology  I pay a lot of attention to  so  you know  one of the first things you got was a little hand axe. Generations go by  somebody says  hey  why don't we put it on a stick  Just absolutely delights the little ones. Next best thing to a video game. This may not seem to impress  but technological evolution is progressive  so another            years  and armaments technology takes you here. Impressive. And the rate of technological evolution speeds up  so a mere quarter of a century after this  you get this  OK. And this. I'm sorry    it was a cheap laugh  but I wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse  and I thought that might do it. So  what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse is the collapse of global social organization. Now  first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are  to be on the brink of true global social organization. Originally  you had the most complex societies  the hunter gatherer village. Stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom  which is what you get with the invention of agriculture  multi village polity with centralized rule. With the invention of writing  you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that because it makes it look like a one celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point. And then you get to  you know  you get empires. I want to stress  you know  social organization can transcend political bounds. This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire. So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent  even if no polity did similarly. Today  you've got nation states. Point is  there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds. This is actually just a picture of the earth at night  and I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty. Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system. Now  I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called  non zero sumness.  Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading  very quickly  the key idea is the distinction between zero sum games  in which correlations are inverse  always a winner and a loser. Non zero sum games in which correlations can be positive  OK. So like in tennis  usually it's win lose  it always adds up to zero zero sum. But if you're playing doubles  the person on your side of the net  they're in the same boat as you  so you're playing a non zero sum game with them. It's either for the better or for the worse  OK. A lot of forms of non zero sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation. The argument I make is basically that  well  non zero sum games have always been part of life. You have them in hunter gatherer societies  but then through technological evolution  new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non zero sum games  involving more people over larger territory. Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential  so you get cities  you know  and you get all the non zero sum games you don't think about that are being played across the world. Like  have you ever thought when you buy a car  how many people on how many different continents contributed to the manufacture of that car  Those are people in effect you're playing a non zero sum game with. I mean  there are certainly plenty of them around. Now  this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way  because when you think of non zero  you think win win  you know  that's good. Well  there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat. First of all  it can accommodate  it doesn't deny the existence of inequality exploitation war. But there's a more fundamental reason that it's not intrinsically upbeat  because a non zero sum game  all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse. It doesn't necessarily predict a win win outcome. So  in a way  the question is  on what grounds am I upbeat at all about history  And the answer is  first of all  on balance I would say people have played their games to more win win outcomes than lose lose outcomes. On balance  I think history is a net positive in the non zero sum game department. And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me  most impresses me  and most uplifts me  which is that there is a moral dimension to history  there is a moral arrow. We have seen moral progress over time.       years ago  members of one Greek city state considered members of another Greek city state subhuman and treated them that way. And then this moral revolution arrived  and they decided that actually  no  Greeks are human beings. It's just the Persians who aren't fully human and don't deserve to be treated very nicely. But this was progress    you know  give them credit. And now today  we've seen more progress. I think    I hope    most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings  deserve to be treated decently  unless they do something horrendous  regardless of race or religion. And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been  OK. This was not a prevalent view  few thousand years ago  and I attribute it to this non zero sum dynamic. I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities  ethnicities  religions as there is today. If you asked me  you know  why am I not in favor of bombing Japan  well  I'm only half joking when I say they built my car. We have this non zero sum relationship  and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours    you're more likely to cut them a break. I kind of think this is a kind of a business class morality. Unfortunately  I don't fly trans Atlantic business class often enough to know  or any other kind of business class really  but I assume that in business class  you don't hear many expressions of  you know  bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups  because the people who are flying trans Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people  they're making money off all these people. And I really do think that  in that sense at least  capitalism has been a constructive force  and more fundamentally  it's a non zero sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm of moral awareness. I think the non zero sum dynamic  which is not only economic by any means    it's not always commerce    but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth  which is the fundamental equality of everyone. It has done that. As it has moved global  moved us toward a global level of social organization  it has driven us toward moral truth. I think that's wonderful. Now  back to the unfolding apocalypse. And you may wonder  OK  that's all fine  sounds great    moral direction in history    but what about this so called clash of civilizations  Well  first of all  I would emphasize that it fits into the non zero sum framework  OK. If you look at the relationship between the so called Muslim world and Western world    two terms I don't like  but can't really avoid  in such a short span of time  they're efficient if nothing else    it is non zero sum. And by that I mean  if people in the Muslim world get more hateful  more resentful  less happy with their place in the world  it'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy  it'll be good for the West. So that is a non zero sum dynamic. And I would say the non zero sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends  but more intense in a kind of negative way. It's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible. And one reason is because of something I call the  growing lethality of hatred.  More and more  it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil. And that's pretty new  and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse    this capacity    because of trends in information technology  in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology. We may be hearing more about that today. And there's something I worry about especially  which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope. What I have in mind is  terrorism happens here  we overreact to it. That  you know  we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad  more terrorism. We overreact because being human  we feel like retaliating  and it gets worse and worse and worse. You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes  but I think in something so spooky  we really shouldn't have the word positive there at all  even in a technical sense. So let's call it the death spiral of negativity. I assure you if it happens  at the end  both the West and the Muslim world will have suffered. So  what do we do  Well  first of all  we can do a lot more with arms control  the international regulation of dangerous technologies. I have a whole global governance sermon that I will spare you right now  because I don't think that's going to be enough anyway  although it's essential. I think we're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world. I think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups  less bigotry  and  you know  racial groups  religious groups  whatever. I've got to admit I feel silly saying that. It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish. I feel like Rodney King  you know  saying  why can't we all just get along  But hey  I don't really see any alternative  given the way I read the situation. There's going to have to be moral progress. There's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world  given how dangerous it's becoming. In my defense  I'd say  as naive as this may sound  it's ultimately grounded in cynicism. That is to say       thank you  thank you. That is to say  remember  my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self interest. It's when people's fortunes are correlated. It's when your welfare conduces to mine  that I decide  oh yeah  I'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far  and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes  and if people respond to it intelligently  we will see the development of tolerance and so on    the norms that we need  you know. We will see the further evolution of this kind of business class morality. So  these two things  you know  if they get people's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self interests  which is further the moral evolution  then they could actually have a constructive effect. And that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric  reasons to be cheerful. Doing the best I can  OK. I never called myself Mr. Uplift. I'm just doing what I can here. Now  launching a moral revolution has got to be hard  right  I mean  what do you do  And I think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things. We all start where we are. Speaking as an American who has children whose security            years down the road I worry about    what I personally want to start out doing is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us  OK. I think that's a worthy research project myself. I also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise. Because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something    somebody you're kind of viewing as alien  who's doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange    to really understand why they do the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment  because you've got to relate their experience to yours. To really understand it  you've got to say   Oh  I get it. So when they feel resentful  it's kind of like the way I feel resentful when this happens  and for somewhat the same reasons.  That's true understanding. And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that. It's especially hard to do when people hate you  OK  because you don't really  in a sense  want to completely understand why people hate you. I mean  you want to hear the reason  but you don't want to be able to relate to it. You don't want it to make sense  right   Laughter  You don't want to say   Well  yeah  I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in.  That's not a pleasant thing  but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and work on. Now  I want to stress that to understand  you know    there are people who don't like this whole business of understanding the grassroots  the root causes of things  they don't want to know why people hate us. I want to understand it. The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us  is to get them to quit hating us. The idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them  is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run. I think it's the first step toward that. That's the long term goal. There are people who worry about this  and in fact  I  myself  apparently  was denounced on national TV a couple of nights ago because of an op ed I'd written. It was kind of along these lines  and the allegation was that I have  quote   affection for terrorists.  Now  the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter. I mean  if you've got to have an enemy  do make it Ann Coulter. But it's not a crazy concern  OK  because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy  and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love  and so on. But I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough  than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can't  you know  get the army out to kill terrorists. So I'm not really worried about it. So       I mean  we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts  but if we succeed    if we succeed    then once again  non zero sumness and the recognition of non zero sum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level. And a kind of saving higher moral level  something that kind of literally saves the world. If you look at the word  salvation  in the Bible    the Christian usage that we're familiar with    saving souls  that people go to heaven    that's actually a latecomer. The original meaning of the word  salvation  in the Bible is about saving the social system.  Yahweh is our Savior  means  He has saved the nation of Israel   which at the time  was a pretty high level social organization. Now  social organization has reached the global level  and I guess  if there's good news I can say I'm bringing you  it's just that all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit of self interests in a disciplined and careful way. It's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway because we've just come too far to screw it up now. Thanks. If you haven't ordered yet  I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine. So  sorry    it just feels like I should be doing stand up up here because of the setting. No  what I want to do is take you back to      in London for the next few minutes  and tell the story    in brief    of this outbreak  which in many ways  I think  helped create the world that we live in today  and particularly the kind of city that we live in today. This period in       in the middle part of the   th century  in London's history  is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons. But I think the most important one is that London was this city of  .  million people  and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point. But it was also the largest city that had ever been built. And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living  this scale of living that we  you know  now call  metropolitan living.  And it was in many ways  at this point in the mid     s  a complete disaster. They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure. So people  for instance  just to gross you out for a second  had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like  a foot to two feet deep. And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away  and of course it never really would go away. And all of this stuff  basically  had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in. It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools  but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people. Not just the horses  but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk  that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died  and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street. So  you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench. And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody  that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years. And cholera was really the great killer of this period. It arrived in London in       and every four or five years another epidemic would take                people in London and throughout the U.K. And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem. We had to get rid of the smell. And so  in fact  they concocted a couple of early  you know  founding public health interventions in the system of the city  one of which was called the  Nuisances Act   which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river. Because if we get it out of the streets  it'll smell much better  and    oh right  we drink from the river. So what ended up happening  actually  is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because  as we now know  cholera is actually in the water. It's a waterborne disease  not something that's in the air. It's not something you smell or inhale  it's something you ingest. And so one of the founding moments of public health in the   th century effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing. So this was the state of London in       and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions  and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people  it was a very talented classic   th century multi disciplinarian named John Snow  who was a local doctor in Soho in London  who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was  in fact  a waterborne disease  and had basically convinced nobody of this. The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say. And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies  but nothing had really stuck. And part of    what's so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways  it's a great case study in how cultural change happens  how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas. And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored. And then on one day  August   th of       a young child  a five month old girl whose first name we don't know  we know her only as Baby Lewis  somehow contracted cholera  came down with cholera at    Broad Street. You can't really see it in this map  but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book. It's in the middle of Soho  in this working class neighborhood  this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool  that they still continue to have  despite the Nuisances Act  bordered on an extremely popular water pump  local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho  that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to. And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump  and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later. Literally     percent of the neighborhood died in seven days  and much more would have died if people hadn't fled after the initial outbreak kicked in. So it was this incredibly terrifying event. You had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of    hours of cholera  alone in their one room apartments  in their little flats. Just an extraordinary  terrifying scene. Snow lived near there  heard about the outbreak  and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that  in fact  the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air. He suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source. One single thing that everybody was going to because it didn't have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect. And so he went right in there and started interviewing people. He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure  who's kind of the other protagonist of the book    this guy  Henry Whitehead  who was a local minister  who was not at all a man of science  but was incredibly socially connected  he knew everybody in the neighborhood. And he managed to track down  Whitehead did  many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump  or who hadn't drunk water from the pump. And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak. He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick. People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick. And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods  people who hadn't  you know  percentages of people who hadn't  but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see. Something that would take in a sense a higher level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood. And so he created this map  which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address. And you can see in this map  the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about    people dead. And the map is actually a little bit bigger. As you get further and further away from the pump  the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent. And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance. And so  with the help of this map  and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did  eventually  actually  the authorities slowly started to come around. It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story  but by       when the next big cholera outbreak came to London  the authorities had been convinced    in part because of this story  in part because of this map    that in fact the water was the problem. And they had already started building the sewers in London  and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water. And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since. So  part of this story  I think    well  it's a terrifying story  it's a very dark story and it's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world. It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic  which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason  if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps  if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead  if we listen to the locals who understand what's going on in these kinds of situations. And what it ended up doing is making the idea of large scale metropolitan living a sustainable one. When people were looking at    percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days  there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on  that people weren't meant to live in cities of  .  million people. But because of what Snow did  because of this map  because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map  we now take for granted that cities have    million people  cities like this one are in fact sustainable things. We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that  you know  Rome did  and be    percent of its size in     years or     years. And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map. It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life  the life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much. What I'm going to do  in the spirit of collaborative creativity  is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made  but do them    this is called  creative collaboration   it's actually called  borrowing     but do it through a particular perspective  and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that Jimmy and others have talked about. Let me just ask you  to start with  this simple question  who invented the mountain bike  Because traditional economic theory would say  well  the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R D lab where they were thinking up new projects  and it came out of there. It didn't come from there. Another answer might be  well  it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage  who  working away on different kinds of bikes  comes up with a bike out of thin air. It didn't come from there. The mountain bike came from users  came from young users  particularly a group in Northern California  who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes  which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode  or your big brother  and they're very glamorous. But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode  which sort of had big handlebars like that  and they were too heavy. So  they got the frames from these big bikes  put them together with the gears from the racing bikes  got the brakes from motorcycles  and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients. And for the first  I don't know  three to five years of their life  mountain bikes were known as  clunkers.  And they were just made in a community of bikers  mainly in Northern California. And then one of these companies that was importing parts for the clunkers decided to set up in business  start selling them to other people  and gradually another company emerged out of that  Marin  and it probably was  I don't know      maybe even     years  before the big bike companies realized there was a market. Thirty years later  mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for    percent of bike sales in America. That's    billion dollars. This is a category entirely created by consumers that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market because they couldn't see the need  the opportunity  they didn't have the incentive to innovate. The one thing I think I disagree with about Yochai's presentation is when he said the Internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive. It's when the Internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro am consumers    who are knowledgeable  they've got the incentive to innovate  they've got the tools  they want to    that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration. And out of that  you get the need for the kind of things that Jimmy was talking about  which is our new kinds of organization  or a better way to put it  how do we organize ourselves without organizations  That's now possible  you don't need an organization to be organized  to achieve large and complex tasks  like innovating new software programs. So this is a huge challenge to the way we think creativity comes about. The traditional view  still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity    in organizations  in government    is that creativity is about special people  wear baseball caps the wrong way round  come to conferences like this  in special places  elite universities  R D labs in the forests  water  maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors  you know  bean bags  maybe the odd table football table. Special people  special places  think up special ideas  then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers  who are passive. They can say  yes  or  no  to the invention. That's the idea of creativity. What's the policy recommendation out of that if you're in government  or you're running a large company  More special people  more special places. Build creative clusters in cities  create more R D parks  so on and so forth. Expand the pipeline down to the consumers. Well this view  I think  is increasingly wrong. I think it's always been wrong  because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative  and it's probably been largely interactive. But it's increasingly wrong  and one of the reasons it's wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline. The ideas are coming back from the consumers  and they're often ahead of the producers. Why is that  Well  one issue is that radical innovation  when you've got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people  have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them. The payoffs to innovation are greatest where the uncertainty is highest. And when you get a radical innovation  it's often very uncertain how it can be applied. The whole history of telephony is a story of dealing with that uncertainty. The very first landline telephones  the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from West End theaters. When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS  they had no idea what it was for  it was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use. So the more radical the innovation  the more the uncertainty  the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for. All of our patents  our entire approach to patents and invention  is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for  we can say what it's for. More and more  the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance. It will be worked out in use  in collaboration with users. We like to think that invention is a sort of moment of creation  there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea. The truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative  like Wikipedia  it develops over a long period of time. The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big  disruptive innovations. If you want to find the big new ideas  it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets  in big organizations. And just look inside large organizations and you'll see why that is so. So  you're in a big corporation. You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder. Do you go into your board and say   Look  I've got a fantastic idea for an embryonic product in a marginal market  with consumers we've never dealt with before  and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff  but it could be really  really big in the future   No  what you do  is you go in and you say   I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users  and I can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years.  Big corporations have an in built tendency to reinforce past success. They've got so much sunk in it that it's very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets. Emerging new markets  then  are the breeding grounds for passionate users. Best example  who in the music industry     years ago  would have said   Yes  let's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to. That sounds like a winner  we'll go with it.  So what happens  Rap music is created by the users. They do it on their own tapes  with their own recording equipment  they distribute it themselves.    years later  rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture    would never have come from the big companies. Had to start    this is the third point    with these pro ams. This is the phrase that I've used in some stuff which I've done with a think tank in London called Demos  where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs    i.e.  they do it for the love of it    but they want to do it to very high standards. And across a whole range of fields    from software  astronomy  natural sciences  vast areas of leisure and culture like kite surfing  so on and so forth    you find people who want to do things because they love it  but they want to do these things to very high standards. They work at their leisure  if you like. They take their leisure very seriously  they acquire skills  they invest time  they use technology that's getting cheaper    it's not just the Internet  cameras  design technology  leisure technology  surfboards  so on and so forth. Largely through globalization  a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper. More knowledgeable consumers  more educated  more able to connect with one another  more able to do things together. Consumption  in that sense  is an expression of their productive potential. Why  we found  people were interested in this  is that at work they don't feel very expressed. They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them  so they pick up these kinds of activities. This has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life. Take astronomy as an example  which Yochai has already mentioned. Twenty years ago     years ago  only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space. And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank  and when I was a kid  it was amazing  because the moon shots would take off  and this thing would move on rails. And it was huge    it was absolutely enormous. Now  six amateur astronomers  working with the Internet  with Dobsonian digital telescopes    which are pretty much open source    with some light sensors developed over the last    years  the Internet    they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do    years ago. So here in astronomy  you have this vast explosion of new productive resources. The users can be producers. What does this mean  then  for our organizational landscape  Well  just imagine a world  for the moment  divided into two camps. Over here  you've got the old  traditional corporate model  special people  special places  patent it  push it down the pipeline to largely waiting  passive consumers. Over here  let's imagine we've got Wikipedia  Linux  and beyond    open source. This is open  this is closed. This is new  this is traditional. Well  the first thing you can say  I think with certainty  is what Yochai has said already    is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms. These people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding  because they're threatened by them. And so the debates about copyright  digital rights  so on and so forth    these are all about trying to stifle  in my view  these kinds of organizations. What we're seeing is a complete corruption of the idea of patents and copyright. Meant to be a way to incentivize invention  meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge  they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place. Let me just give you two examples. The first is  imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying   I've got a fantastic idea. I've invented this brilliant new program that is much  much better than Microsoft Outlook.  Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with Microsoft  with Microsoft Outlook  No one. That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come    will only come    from an open source kind of project. So  there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for open source and consumer driven innovation  because it's one of the greatest competitive levers against monopoly. There'll be huge professional arguments as well. Because the professionals  over here in these closed organizations    they might be academics  they might be programmers  they might be doctors  they might be journalists    my former profession    say   No  no    you can't trust these people over here.  When I started in journalism    Financial Times     years ago    it was very  very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper. And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube to see if they were reading your article. Usually they were reading the share prices  and the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor  or something like that  and you know   For heaven's sake  what are they doing  They're not reading my brilliant article   And we allowed users  readers  two places where they could contribute to the paper  the letters page  where they could write a letter in  and we would condescend to them  cut it in half  and print it three days later. Or the op ed page  where if they knew the editor    had been to school with him  slept with his wife    they could write an article for the op ed page. Those were the two places. Shock  horror  now  the readers want to be writers and publishers. That's not their role  they're supposed to read what we write. But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think that the bloggers want to be journalists  they don't want to be journalists  they just want to have a voice. They want to  as Jimmy said  they want to have a dialogue  a conversation. They want to be part of that flow of information. What's happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding. So  there's going to be a tremendous struggle. But  also  there's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed. What you'll see  I think  is two things that are critical  and these  I think  are two challenges for the open movement. The first is  can we really survive on volunteers  If this is so critical  do we not need it funded  organized  supported in much more structured ways  I think the idea of creating the Red Cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea  but can we really organize that  just on volunteers  What kind of changes do we need in public policy and funding to make that possible  What's the role of the BBC  for instance  in that world  What should be the role of public policy  And finally  what I think you will see is the intelligent  closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction. So it's not going to be a contest between two camps  but  in between them  you'll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy. New organizational models coming about  mixing closed and open in tricky ways. It won't be so clear cut  it won't be Microsoft versus Linux    there'll be all sorts of things in between. And those organizational models  it turns out  are incredibly powerful  and the people who can understand them will be very  very successful. Let me just give you one final example of what that means. I was in Shanghai  in an office block built on what was a rice paddy five years ago    one of the       skyscrapers they've built in Shanghai in the last    years. And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan. Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in     . Didn't go into the Internet  kept his money  decided to go into computer games. He runs a company called Shanda  which is the largest computer games company in China. Nine thousand servers all over China  has     million subscribers. At any one time  there are four million people playing one of his games. How many people does he employ to service that population      people. Well  how can he service     million people from     employees  Because basically  he doesn't service them. He gives them a platform  he gives them some rules  he gives them the tools and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation  he orchestrates the action. But actually  a lot of the content is created by the users themselves. And it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really  really powerful. The best measure of that  so you go into one of his games  you create a character that you develop in the course of the game. If  for some reason  your credit card bounces  or there's some other problem  you lose your character. You've got two options. One option  you can create a new character  right from scratch  but with none of the history of your player. That costs about     dollars. Or you can get on a plane  fly to Shanghai  queue up outside Shanda's offices    cost probably          dollars    and reclaim your character  get your history back. Every morning  there are     people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters.  Laughter  So this is about companies built on communities  that provide communities with tools  resources  platforms in which they can share. He's not open source  but it's very  very powerful. So here is one of the challenges  I think  for people like me  who do a lot of work with government. If you're a games company  and you've got a million players in your game  you only need one percent of them to be co developers  contributing ideas  and you've got a development workforce of        people. Imagine you could take all the children in education in Britain  and one percent of them were co developers of education. What would that do to the resources available to the education system  Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS to  in some sense  be co producers of health. The reason why    despite all the efforts to cut it down  to constrain it  to hold it back    why these open models will still start emerging with tremendous force  is that they multiply our productive resources. And one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers  consumers into designers. Thank you very much. So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl   If you say a word often enough  it becomes you.  And having grown up in a segregated city  Baltimore  Maryland  I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder    thank God for technology    to interview people  thinking that if I walked in their words    which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform    if I walked in their words  that I could sort of absorb America. I was also inspired by Walt Whitman  who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him. So these four characters are going to be from that work that I've been doing for many years now  and well over  I don't know  a couple of thousand people I've interviewed. Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel  that old radio man  So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history. You know  he was  born in       the year the Titanic sank  greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg  and bam  it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow  some century.  So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.  Defining moment in American history  I don't think there's one  you can't say Hiroshima  that's a big one    I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment. The gradual slippage    'slippage' is the word used by the people in Watergate  moral slippage    it's a gradual kind of thing  combination of things. You see  we also have the technology. I say  less and less the human touch.  Oh  let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit. The Atlanta airport is a modern airport  and they should leave the gate there. These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination. And these trains are smooth  and they're quiet and they're efficient. And there's a voice on the train  you know the voice was a human voice. You see in the old days we had robots  robots imitated humans. Now we have humans imitating robots. So we got this voice on this train  Concourse One  Omaha  Lincoln. Concourse Two  Dallas  Fort Worth. Same voice. Just as a train is about to go  a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors. And that voice  without losing a beat  says  'Because of late entry  we're delayed    seconds.' Just then  everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple's going like this  you know  shrinking. Well  I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding    I do that to steel my nerves    and so I imitate a train call  holding my hand on my    'George Orwell  your time has come ' you see. Well  some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs when I say that  but not on this train. Silence. And so suddenly they're looking at me. So here I am with the couple  the three of us shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up  you know.  Just then I see a baby  a little baby in the lap of a mother. I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion. So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby  holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be     proof  I say to the baby  'Sir or Madam  what is your considered opinion of the human species ' And the baby looks  you know  the way babies look at you clearly  starts laughing  starts busting out with this crazy little laugh. I say  'Thank God for a human reaction  we haven't lost yet.'  But you see  the human touch  you see  it's disappearing. You know  you see  you've got to question the official truth. You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain    you know we honor Mark Twain  but we don't read him. We read 'Huck Finn ' of course  we read 'Huck Finn' of course. I mean  Huck  of course  was tremendous. Remember that great scene on the raft  remember what Huck did  You see  here's Huck  he's an illiterate kid  he's had no schooling  but there's something in him. And the official truth  the truth was  the law was  that a black man was a property  was a thing  you see. And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim  a slave  see. And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them  and Huck says  'Ooh  oh my God  ooh  ooh    that woman  that woman never did anybody any harm. Ooh  he's going to steal  he's going to steal  he's going to do a terrible thing.' Just then  two slavers caught up  guys chasing slaves  looking for Jim. 'Anybody up on that raft with you ' Huck says  'Yeah.' 'Is he black or white ' 'White.' And they go off. And Huck said  'Oh my God  oh my God  I lied  I lied  ooh  I did a terrible thing  did a terrible thing    why do I feel so good '  But it's the goodness of Huck  that stuff that Huck's been made of  you see  all been buried  it's all been buried. So the human touch  you see  it's disappearing. So you ask about a defining moment    ain't no defining moment in American history for me. It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now  where trivia becomes news. And more and more  less and less awareness of the pain of the other. Huh. You know  I don't know if you could use this or not  but I was quoting Wright Morris  a writer from Nebraska  who says  'We're more and more into communications and less and less into communication.' Okay  kids  I got to scram  got to go see my cardiologist.  And that's Studs Terkel. So  talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes. You know  most actors want to do characters that are likeable    well  not always  but the notion  especially at a conference like this  I like to inspire people. But since this was called  risk taking   I'm doing somebody who I never do  because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in. And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk  at a conference like this  as a good thing. But there are certain other connotations to the word  risk   and the same thing about the word  nature.  What is nature  Maxine Greene  who's a wonderful philosopher who's as old as Studs  and was the head of a philosophy    great  big philosophy kind of an organization    I went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know  that she still wants to know. And she said   Well  personally  I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university. And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee for my male colleagues  even though I've outlived most of them.  And she said   And then intellectually  I don't know enough about the negative imagination. And September   th certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate.  So this piece is about a negative imagination. It raises questions about what nature is  what Mother Nature is  and about what a risk can be. And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women. Everything I do is word for word off a tape. And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems  and this is called  A Mirror to Her Mouth.  And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.  I began to learn how to cover it up  because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home. I want everybody to think we were a normal family. I mean we had all the materialistic things  but that didn't make my children pain any less  that didn't make their fears subside. I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses. And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family  it was a nightmare. And I failed them dramatically  because I allowed it to go on and on and on.  But the night that Myesha got killed    and the intensity just grew and grew and grew  until one night we came home from getting drugs  and he got angry with Myesha  and he started beating her  and he put her in a bathtub. Oh  he would use a belt. He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that Myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other    that would be his reason. I'm just talking about the particular night that she died. And so he put her in the bathtub  and I was in the bedroom with the baby.  And four months before this happened  four months before Myesha died  I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him    insane    thinking that if I gave him his own kid  he would leave mine alone. And it didn't work  didn't work. And I ended up with three children  Houston  Myesha and Dominic  who was four months old when I came to jail.  And I was in the bedroom. Like I said  he had her in the bathroom and he    he    every time he hit her  she would fall. And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously  repeatedly. I could hear it  but I dared not to move. I didn't move. I didn't even go and see what was happening. I just sat there and listened. And then he put her in the hallway. He told her  just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours. And then he told her  get up. And when she got up  she says she couldn't see. Her face was bruised. She had a black eye. All around her head was just swollen  her head was about two sizes of its own size. I told him  'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.  The next morning she was dead. He went in to check on her for school  and he got very excited. He says  'She won't breathe.' I knew immediately that she was dead. I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead  so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth    there was no thing  nothing  coming out of her mouth. He said  he said  he said  'We can't  we can't let nobody find out about this.' He say  'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.  I mean  I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years  so it just seemed like second hand to me  just to keep on keeping it a secret. So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had  like  lost her  that she was missing. We told a security guard that she was missing  though she wasn't missing. And we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard that we had put on her.  And then we got the baby and my other child  and we drove out to  like  I   . I was so petrified and so numb  all I could look was in the rear view mirror. And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway. My own child  I let that happen to.  So that's an investigation of the negative imagination. When I started this project called  On the Road  A Search For an American Character  with my tape recorder  I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects    bull riders  cowboys  pig farmers  drum majorettes    but I sort of got tripped on race relations  because my first big show was a show about a race riot. And so I went to both    two race riots  one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that. Because this is what I would say I've learned the most about race relations  from this piece. It's a kind of an aria  I would say  and in many tapes that I have. Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King. It was captured on videotape    technology    and it was played all over the world. Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail. They did not  so there were riots. And what a lot of people forget  is there was a second trial  ordered by George Bush  Sr. And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial. And I mean  the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot. Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way. So there was a community that didn't    the Korean Americans  whose stores had been burned to the ground. And so this woman  Mrs. Young Soon Han  I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race. And she asks also a question that Studs talks about  this notion of the  official truth   to question the  official truth.  So what she's questioning here  she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society. And this is called   Swallowing the Bitterness.   I used to believe America was the best. I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie. I never saw any poor man  any black. Until       I used to believe America was the best    I still do  I don't deny that because I am a victim. But at the end of '    when we were in such turmoil  and having all the financial problems  and all the mental problems  I began to really realize that Koreans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing. Why  Why do we have to be left out  We didn't qualify for medical treatment  no food stamp  no GR  no welfare  anything. Many African Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive. We didn't get any because we have a car and a house. And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice   OK. OK  OK. OK. Many African Americans probably think that they won by the trial. I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict  and all the day they were having a party  they celebrated  all of South Central  all the churches. And they say  'Well  finally justice has been done in this society.' Well  what about victims' rights  They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants. They have a lot of respect  as I do  for Dr. Martin King. He is the only model for black community  I don't care Jesse Jackson. He is the model of non violence  non violence    and they would all like to be in his spirit.  But what about       They destroyed innocent people. And I wonder if that is really justice for them  to get their rights in that way. I was swallowing the bitterness  sitting here alone and watching them. They became so hilarious  but I was happy for them. I was glad for them. At least they got something back  OK. Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them. They fought for their rights for over two centuries  and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities  Hispanic  Asian  we would suffer more in the mainstream. That's why I understand  that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.  But I wish that  I wish that  I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment. I wish that I could live together with black people. But after the riot  it's too much difference. The fire is still there. How do you say it   Unclear . Igniting  igniting  igniting fire. Igniting fire. It's still there  it can burst out anytime.  Mrs. Young Soon Han. The other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody  walking really in somebody else's shoes. And I told you that in    you know  I didn't give you the year  but in '   I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that  and I got sidetracked on race relations. Finally  I did find a bull rider  two years ago. And I've been going to the rodeos with him  and we've bonded. And he's the lead in an op ed I did about the Republican Convention. He's a Republican    I won't say anything about my party affiliation  but anyway    so this is my dear  dear Brent Williams  and this is on toughness  in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this. And this is called  Toughness.   Well  I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist. I mean  you know  I mean  it's like my wife  Jolene  her family's always saying  you know  you ever think he's just a born loser  It seems like he has so much bad luck  you know. But then when that bull stepped on my kidney  you know  I didn't lose my kidney    I could have lost my kidney  I kept my kidney  so I don't think I'm a born loser. I think that's good luck.  And  I mean  funny things like this happen. I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan  and there was a Reader's Digest  October     . It was like  'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says if you want to get lucky  you know  you've got to be around positive people. I mean  like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me  she's like  'She's just talking  she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'  And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet. She said  'Look who she is. You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.' And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because I've never been to college  and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything. I said  'Well look  the woman talked to me for four hours. You know  if I wasn't talking    you know  like  you know  she wanted me to talk  I don't think she would even come out here.'  Confidence  Well  I think I ride more out of determination than confidence. I mean  confidence is like  you know  you've been on that bull before  you know you can ride him. I mean  confidence is kind of like being cocky  but in a good way. But determination  you know  it's like just  you know  'Fuck the form  get the horn.' That's Tuff Hedeman  in the movie '  Seconds.' I mean  like  Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy  he say  'You know  you got more try than any kid I ever seen.' And try and determination is the same thing. Determination is  like  you're going to hang on that bull  even if you're riding upside down. Determination's like  you're going to ride till your head hits the back of the dirt.  Freedom  It would have to be the rodeo.  Beauty  I don't think I know what beauty is. Well  you know  I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too. I mean  look how we are  the roughy family  palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me. It's like  you know  racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas. We ride together  we  you know  we  we eat together and we sleep together. I mean  I can't even imagine what it's going to be like the last day I rodeo. I mean  I'll be alright. I mean  I have my ranch and everything  but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes. I mean  I guess it just be like    I guess it be like the day my brother died.  Toughness  Well  we was in West Jordan  Utah  and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a    you know  busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital. And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out. And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night  so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia  or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up. And then they had to straighten out my nose  and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head  and everybody said that it should have killed me  but it didn't  because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain. But the good thing was  once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out  I could breathe  and I hadn't been able to breathe since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo.  Thank you. So anyway  who am I  I usually say to people  when they say   What do you do   I say   I do hardware   because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do. And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event  to which he replied   How quaint.  And I sort of really was dumbstruck. And I really should have said something smart. And now I've had a little bit of time to think about it  I would have said   Well  you know  if we look at the next     years and we've seen all these problems in the last few days  most of the big issues    clean water  clean energy    and they're interchangeable in some respects    and cleaner  more functional materials    they all look to me to be hardware problems. This doesn't mean we should ignore software  or information  or computation.  And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about. So  this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future. Now  TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker about  do this  do that  and you fill out all these forms  and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you  and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist. And I've always been nervous about the term  futurist   because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it. And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have  and said   You know  well  if I have to talk about the future  what is it   And George Homsey  a great guy  said   Oh  the future is amazing. It is so much stranger than you think. We're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut  and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint.  So  you may think that's sort of really crazy  but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible. So  this isn't my work  but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT. This is called the registry of standard biological parts. This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very  very bright individuals. Basically  what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system. Literally  think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program. Now  this is actually becoming such an interesting idea. This is a state diagram. That's an extremely simple computer. This one is a two bit counter. So that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches. And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology. And from the results of the same competition last year  a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off. So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do  if then for  statements in materials  in structure. This is a pretty interesting trend  because we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly   Form follows function   but I think I've sort of grown up in a world    you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday  I was in a lab associated with his    where it's really a world where information defines form and function. I spent six years thinking about that  but to show you the power of art over science    this is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called  HowToons.  I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta. Took me six years at MIT  and about that many pages to describe what I was doing  and it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker. He's an interesting little kid    and his sister  Celine    and what he's doing here is observing the self assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl. And in fact you can program the self assembly of things  so he starts chocolate dipping edges  changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity. In theory  if you program those sufficiently  you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure. In this case  he's done self replication of a complex  D structure. And that's what I thought about for a long time  because this is how we currently make things. This is a silicon wafer  and essentially that's just a whole bunch of layers of two dimensional stuff  sort of layered up. The feature side is    you know  people will say   unclear  down around about    nanometers now. On the right  that's a radiolara. That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans. And that has feature sizes down to about    nanometers  and it's a complex  D structure. We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way. The secret to biology is  it builds computation into the way it makes things. So this little thing here  polymerase  is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA. And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins. I thought about this in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials  but can we do similar things  Can we get self replicating type behavior  Can we get complex  D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems  Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems  like higher speed semiconductors  etc. So  this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self replicating system. And this is sort of Babbage's revenge. These are little mechanical computers. These are five state state machines. So  that's about three light switches lined up. In a neutral state  they won't bind at all. Now  if I make a string of these  a bit string  they will be able to replicate. So we start with white  blue  blue  white. That encodes  that will now copy. From one comes two  and then from two comes three. And so you've got this sort of replicating system. It was work actually by Lionel Penrose  father of Roger Penrose  the tiles guy. He did a lot of this work in the '  s  and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution  but it's now coming back. So now I'm going to show you the hands free  autonomous self replication. So we've tracked in the video the input string  which was green  green  yellow  yellow  green. We set them off on this air hockey table. You know  high science uses air hockey tables       and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy  but what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here. So we've got autonomous replication of bit strings. So  why would you want to replicate bit strings  Well  it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme  that you can take a linear string  which is a convenient thing to copy  and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex  D structure. So I was trying to  you know  take the engineer's version  Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing  So what I'm showing you here is that we can make a  D shape    the B    assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules. And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here  and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design  was that you don't need digital logic to do computation. And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips. So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process. So  Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday  I believe  but I'll show you again. This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles. Each different color has a different magnetic polarity  and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out. Now  hopefully  those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that  and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary  D structure  and in fact  you know  I can now take a dog  carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. And now I can actually define that three dimensional object as a sequence of bits. So  you know  it's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently. And the universe is now a compiler. And so I'm thinking about  you know  what are the programs for programming the physical universe  And how do we think about materials and structure  sort of as an information and computation problem  Not just where you attach a micro controller to the end point  but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic  are the computers. Having totally absorbed this philosophy  I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently. With the universe as a computer  you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations. You set a couple of boundary conditions  like gravity  the surface tension  density  etc.  and then you press  execute   and magically  the universe produces you a perfect ball lens. So  this actually applied to the problem of    so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world don't have access to cheap eyeglasses. So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site  This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition. If it's circular  you make a spherical lens. If it's elliptical  you can make an astigmatic lens. You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure    so that's part of the extra program. And literally with only those two inputs    so  the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure    you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error  from minus    to plus eight diopters  up to four diopters of cylinder. And then literally  you now pour on a monomer. You know  I'll do a Julia Childs here. This is three minutes of UV light. And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it. Pop it out. I've seen this video  but I still don't know if it's going to end right. So you reverse this. This is a very old movie  so with the new prototypes  actually both surfaces are flexible  but this will show you the point. Now you've finished the lens  you literally pop it out. That's next year's Yves Klein  you know  eyeglasses shape. And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters. And as I rotate it against this side shot  you'll see that that has cylinder  and that was programmed in    literally into the physics of the system. So  this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things  like this. This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment  called  electronic rope.  So literally  you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave. And under no load  it's one structure. Under a different load  it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor. So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope. Just by thinking about the physics of the world  materials as the computer  you can start to do things like this. I'm going to segue a little here. I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this. One thing I'm really interested about this right now is  how  if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer  how do we make things in a very general sense  and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware  And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems  share the information and work on those things together. So  a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time  and unless Lisa Randall changes that  we'll continue to move in linear time. So that means anything you do  or anything you make  you produce a sequence of steps    and I think Lego in the '  s nailed this  and they did it most elegantly. But they can show you how to build things in sequence. So  I'm thinking about  how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things  so you end up with this sort of guy  right  And I think this applies across a very broad    sort of  a lot of concepts. You know  Cameron Sinclair yesterday said   How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity   And if you've seen Amy Smith  she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti. And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things  so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other's source code for structure. I don't know exactly how to do this yet  but  you know  it's something being actively thought about. So  you know  that leads to questions like  is this a compiler  Is this a sub routine  Interesting things like that. Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract  but you know  this is the sort of    returning to our comic characters    this is sort of the universe  or a different universe view  that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future    from biotech to materials assembly. It was great to hear Bill Joy. They're starting to invest in materials science  but these are the new things in materials science. How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas  and see the world in a different way  And it's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe    it's sort of an analog computer. But it's definitely an interesting new worldview. I've gone too far. So that sounds like it's it. I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions  or I can show    I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction  so I may have to explain that. So maybe I'll do that with this short video. So this is actually a       square foot kite  which also happens to be a minimal energy surface. So returning to the droplet  again  thinking about the universe in a new way. This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp. And why do you want a       square foot kite  So that's a kite the size of your house. And so you want that to tow boats very fast. So I've been working on this a little  also  with a couple of other guys. But  you know  this is another way to look at the    if you abstract again  this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe. You could just hang it as a bed sheet  but again  the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape. And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future. This meeting has really been about a digital revolution  but I'd like to argue that it's done  we won. We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it. And I'd like to look after that  to look what comes after the digital revolution. So  let me start projecting forward. These are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT  looking what comes after computers. This first one  Internet Zero  up here    this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag    about a dollar    that can go in every light bulb and doorknob  and this is getting commercialized very quickly. And what's interesting about it isn't the cost  it's the way it encodes the Internet. It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet so you could send it optically  you can communicate acoustically through a power line  through RF. It takes the original principle of the Internet  which is inter networking computers  and now lets devices inter network. That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero  this internet of devices. So this is the next step from there to here  and this is getting commercialized today. A step after that is a project on fungible computers. Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded. So  half as much grain is half as much useful  but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer  and we've been trying to make computers that work that way. So  what you see in the background is a prototype. This was from a thesis of a student  Bill Butow  now at Intel  who wondered why  instead of making bigger and bigger chips  you don't make small chips  put them in a viscous medium  and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch. And that's what you see here. On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer  on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made  but there's no frame buffer  IO processor  any of that stuff    it's just this material. Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully  this is a raw material. If you add twice as much of it  you have twice as much display. If you shoot a gun through the middle  nothing happens. If you need more resource  you just apply more computer. So  that's the step after this    of computing as a raw material. That's still conventional bits  the step after that is    this is an earlier prototype in the lab  this is high speed video slowed down. Now  integrating chemistry in computation  where the bits are bubbles. This is showing making bits  this is showing    once again  slowed down so you can see it  bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de multiplexing. So  now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information. And  ultimately  these are some slides from an early project I did  computing where the bits are stored quantum mechanically in the nuclei of atoms  so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules. All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further  not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms  and they lead to the following recognition. We all know we've had a digital revolution  but what is that  Well  Shannon took us  in the '  s  from here to here  from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem  that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal  you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device. And that's when we got the Internet. Von Neumann  in the '  s  did the same thing for computing  he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT  a differential analyzer  and the more you ran it  the worse the answer got. After Von Neumann  we have the Pentium  where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one. But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner. A state of the art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal  or you maybe melt some plastic. A    billion dollar chip fab uses a process a village artisan would recognize    you spread stuff around and bake it. All the intelligence is external to the system  the materials don't have information. Yesterday you heard about molecular biology  which fundamentally computes to build. It's an information processing system. We've had digital revolutions in communication and computation  but precisely the same idea  precisely the same math Shannon and Von Neuman did  hasn't yet come out to the physical world. So  inspired by that  colleagues in this program    the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT    which is a group of people  like me  who never understood the boundary between physical science and computer science. I would even go further and say computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science       because the canon    computer science    many of them are great but the canon of computer science prematurely froze a model of computation based on technology that was available in       and nature's a much more powerful computer than that. So  you'll hear  tomorrow  from Saul Griffith. He was one of the first students to emerge from this program. We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate. This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically  where you write a code  much like protein folding  that specifies their structure. So  there's no feedback to a tool metrology  the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated. So  you can  for example  do that. You can do other things. That's in  D. It works in  D. The video on the upper right    I won't show for time    shows self replication  templating so something can make something that can make something  and we're doing that now over  maybe  nine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism  in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails that code for their assembly    so  much like the magnets  but now on nanometer scales. Laser micro machining  essentially  D printers that digitally fabricate functional systems  all the way up to building buildings  not by having blueprints  but having the parts code for the structure of the building. So  these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools but computers that are tools  where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits. Now  to do that    with your tax dollars  thank you    I bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal to the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale  all in one place  because you can't segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale. So we put together focused nano beam writers and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro machining systems. But I had a problem. Once I had all these machines  I was spending too much time teaching students to use them. So I started teaching a class  modestly called   How To Make Almost Anything.  And that wasn't meant to be provocative  it was just for a few research students. But the first day of class looked like this. You know  hundreds of people came in begging  all my life I've been waiting for this class  I'll do anything to do it. Then they'd ask  can you teach it at MIT  It seems too useful  And then the next       surprising thing was they weren't there to do research. They were there because they wanted to make stuff. They had no conventional technical background. At the end of a semester they integrated their skills. I'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor  and this is what she did with her semester project. Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream  but you can't because you're at work  or you're in a classroom  or you're watching your children  or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted  Well  scream buddy is a portable space for screaming. When a user screams into scream buddy  their scream is silenced. It is also recorded for later release where  when and how the user chooses. So  Einstein would like this. This student made a web browser for parrots    lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots. This student's made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you're awake  this is one that defends    a dress that defends your personal space. This isn't technology for communication  it's technology to prevent it. This is a device that lets you see your music. This is a student who made a machine that makes machines  and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing. Just year after year    and I finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication is products for a market of one person. You don't need this for what you can get in Wal Mart  you need this for what makes you unique. Ken Olsen famously said  nobody needs a computer in the home. But you don't use it for inventory and payroll  DEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it. You need it for what makes you unique  just like personalization. So  with that  in turn     million dollars today does this     years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything. The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication. Today  when you spend that much of your money  there's a government requirement to do outreach  which often means classes at a local school  a website    stuff that's just not that exciting. So  I made a deal with my NSF program managers that instead of talking about it  I'd give people the tools. This wasn't meant to be provocative or important  but we put together these Fab Labs. It's about        dollars in equipment that approximate both what the    million dollars does and where it's going. A laser cutter to do press fit assembly with  D from  D  a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics  a micron scale  numerically controlled milling machine for precise structures  programming tools for less than a dollar      nanosecond microcontrollers. It lets you work from microns and microseconds on up  and they exploded around the world. This wasn't scheduled  but they went from inner city Boston to Pobal in India  to Secondi Takoradi on Ghana's coast to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa  to the far north of Norway  uncovering  or helping uncover  for all the attention to the digital divide  we would find unused computers in all these places. A farmer in a rural village    a kid needs to measure and modify the world  not just get information about it on a screen. That there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide bigger than the digital divide. And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses. So  in place after place we saw this same progression  that we'd open one of these Fab Labs  where we didn't    this is too crazy to think of. We didn't think this up  that we would get pulled to these places  we'd open it. The first step was just empowerment. You can see it in their face  just this joy of  I can do it. This is a girl in inner city Boston who had just done a high tech on demand craft sale in the inner city community center. It goes on from there to serious hands on technical education informally  out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs. We designed a network sensor  and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab. There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night       her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor. So she insisted on fabbing the board  learning how to stuff it  learning how to program it. She didn't really know what she was doing or why she was doing it  but she knew she just had to do it. There was something electric about it. This is late at  you know     o'clock at night and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time. And I've shown this to engineers at big companies  and they say they can't do this. Any one thing she's doing  they can do better  but it's distributed over many people and many sites and they can't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing. I made a stacking board. And  again  that was just for the joy of it. Then these labs started doing serious problem solving    instrumentation for agriculture in India  steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana  high gain antennas in thin client computers. And then  in turn  businesses started to grow  like making these antennas. And finally  the lab started doing invention. We're learning more from them than we're giving them. I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it. They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box    which  as you see up there  that's becoming a business    but their design was better than Saul's design at MIT  so there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on scaling the work of eight year old children because they had better designs. Real invention is happening in these labs. And I still kept    so  in the last year I've been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this  and I keep saying  but this isn't the real thing. Wait  like     years and then we'll be done. And I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie inventing UNIX on a PDP. PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers. They were tens of thousands of dollars  hard to use  but they brought computing down to work groups  and everything we do today happened there. These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP. The projection of digital fabrication isn't a projection for the future  we are now in the PDP era. We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then. It was very chaotic  it wasn't  sort of  clear what was going on. In the same sense we are now  today  in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication. The only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries. In DC  I go to every agency that wants to talk  you know  in the Bay Area  I go to every organization you can think of    they all want to talk about it  but it breaks their organizational boundaries. In fact  it's illegal for them  in many cases  to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology. And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention coming from this community surprised me  it's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway    this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground rather than the sky because that's where the satellites are    the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in. It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it  so they built this extraordinary village for the lab. This isn't a university  it's not a company. It's essentially a village for invention  it's a village for the outliers in society  and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs all around the world. So this program has split into an NGO foundation  a Fab Foundation to support the scaling  a micro VC fund. The person who runs it nicely describes it as  machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses   it's a cross between micro finance and VC to do fan out  and then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's making it possible. So I'd like to leave you with two thoughts. There's been a sea change in aid  from top down mega projects to bottom up  grassroots  micro finance investing in the roots  so that everybody's got that that's what works. But we still look at technology as top down mega projects. Computing  communication  energy for the rest of the planet are these top down mega projects. If this room full of heroes is just clever enough  you can solve the problems. The message coming from the Fab Labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks  they're sources. The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems. I thought that's the projection    years hence into the future  but it's where we are today. It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of. The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering  but it's here today. And  finally  any talk like this on the future of computing is required to show Moore's law  but my favorite version    this is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper    and what's happened is  year after year after year  we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled  and we've scaled and we've scaled  and we've scaled and we've scaled  and there's this looming bug of what's going to happen at the end of Moore's law  this ultimate bug is coming. But we're coming to appreciate  is the transition from  D to  D  from programming bits to programming atoms  turns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature. So  we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication  where the output of computation programs the physical world. So  together  these two projects answer questions I hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app for personal fabrication in the developed world is technology for a market of one  personal expression in technology that touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology for a very long time. And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide  people locally developing solutions to local problems. Thank you. What I'd like to start off with is an observation  which is that if I've learned anything over the last year  it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast. I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city  studio to studio  interview to interview  serving up the book in really tiny bite size chunks. Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down  but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ... so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air. And I think that    that's not really surprising though  is it  Because that's kind of the world that we live in now  a world stuck in fast forward. A world obsessed with speed  with doing everything faster  with cramming more and more into less and less time. Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock. To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher  which is in my bio there  I'll just toss it out again     These days even instant gratification takes too long.   Laughter  And if you think about how we to try to make things better  what do we do  No  we speed them up  don't we  So we used to dial  now we speed dial. We used to read  now we speed read. We used to walk  now we speed walk. And of course  we used to date and now we speed date. And even things that are by their very nature slow    we try and speed them up too. So I was in New York recently  and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course  a new evening course. And it was for  you guessed it  speed yoga. So this    the perfect solution for time starved professionals who want to  you know  salute the sun  but only want to give over about    minutes to it. I mean  these are sort of the extreme examples  and they're amusing and good to laugh at. But there's a very serious point  and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life  we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us. We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives    on our health  our diet  our work  our relationships  the environment and our community. And sometimes it takes a wake up call  doesn't it  to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives  instead of actually living them  that we're living the fast life  instead of the good life. And I think for many people  that wake up call takes the form of an illness. You know  a burnout  or eventually the body says   I can't take it anymore   and throws in the towel. Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time  or the patience  or the tranquility  to be with the other person  to listen to them. And my wake up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son  and I found that at the end of day  I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down    you know  I'd be speed reading  The Cat In The Hat.  I'd be    you know  I'd be skipping lines here  paragraphs there  sometimes a whole page  and of course  my little boy knew the book inside out  so we would quarrel. And what should have been the most relaxing  the most intimate  the most tender moment of the day  when a dad sits down to read to his son  became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills  a clash between my speed and his slowness. And this went on for some time  until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people. And one of them made reference to a series of books called  The One Minute Bedtime Story.  And I wince saying those words now  but my first reaction at the time was very different. My first reflex was to say   Hallelujah    what a great idea  This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more.  But thankfully  a light bulb went on over my head  and my next reaction was very different  and I took a step back  and I thought   Whoa    you know  has it really come to this  Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day   And I put away the newspaper    and I was getting on a plane    and I sat there  and I did something I hadn't done for a long time    which is I did nothing. I just thought  and I thought long and hard. And by the time I got off that plane  I'd decided I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture  and what it was doing to me and to everyone else. And I had two questions in my head. The first was  how did we get so fast  And the second is  is it possible  or even desirable  to slow down  Now  if you think about how our world got so accelerated  the usual suspects rear their heads. You think of  you know  urbanization  consumerism  the workplace  technology. But I think if you cut through those forces  you get to what might be the deeper driver  the nub of the question  which is how we think about time itself. In other cultures  time is cyclical. It's seen as moving in great  unhurried circles. It's always renewing and refreshing itself. Whereas in the West  time is linear. It's a finite resource  it's always draining away. You either use it  or lose it.  Time is money   as Benjamin Franklin said. And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation. Time is scarce  so what do we do  Well    well  we speed up  don't we  We try and do more and more with less and less time. We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line    a finish line  incidentally  that we never reach  but a finish line nonetheless. And I guess that the question is  is it possible to break free from that mindset  And thankfully  the answer is yes  because what I discovered  when I began looking around  that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better  and that busier is best. Right across the world  people are doing the unthinkable  they're slowing down  and finding that  although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down  you're road kill  the opposite turns out to be true  that by slowing down at the right moments  people find that they do everything better. They eat better  they make love better  they exercise better  they work better  they live better. And  in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration  lie what a lot of people now refer to as the  International Slow Movement.  Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy  I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food  many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement. Started in Italy  but has spread across the world  and now has         members in    countries. And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message  which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate  cook and consume it at a reasonable pace. I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement  and the renaissance of farmers' markets  are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable. They want to get back to slower rhythms. And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement  which has started in Italy  but has spread right across Europe and beyond. And in this  towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape  so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another. So they might curb traffic  or put in a park bench  or some green space. And in some ways  these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts  because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City  it's kind of like a philosophical declaration. It's saying to the rest of world  and to the people in that town  that we believe that in the   st century  slowness has a role to play. In medicine  I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine. And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine  which tend to tap into sort of slower  gentler  more holistic forms of healing. Now  obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies  and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever  you know  gain mainstream approval. But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage  and even just relaxation  clearly have some kind of benefit. And blue chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work  and what we might learn from them. Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around  isn't there  I was coming to    well    no pun intended there. I was making my way  let's say  slowly to Oxford  and I went through a news agent  and I saw a magazine  a men's magazine  and it said on the front   How to bring your partner to orgasm in    seconds.  So  you know  even sex is on a stopwatch these days. Now  you know  I like a quickie as much as the next person  but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex    from slowing down in the bedroom. You know  you tap into that    those deeper  sort of  psychological  emotional  spiritual currents  and you get a better orgasm with the buildup. You can get more bang for your buck  let's say. I mean  the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently  didn't they  when they sang the praises of  a lover with a slow hand.  Now  we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric  but you fast forward a few years  and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops  or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms  finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex. And of course  in Italy where    I mean  Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure    they've launched an official Slow Sex movement. The workplace. Right across much of the world    North America being a notable exception    working hours have been coming down. And Europe is an example of that  and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less  and also that their hourly productivity goes up. Now  clearly there are problems with the    hour workweek in France    too much  too soon  too rigid. But other countries in Europe  notably the Nordic countries  are showing that it's possible to have a kick ass economy without being a workaholic. And Norway  Sweden  Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth  and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy. And if you go beyond sort of the country level  down at the micro company level  more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug    to take a lunch break  or to go sit in a quiet room  to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops    you at the back    mobile phones  during the work day or on the weekend  so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought. It's not just  though  these days  adults who overwork  though  is it  It's children  too. I'm     and my childhood ended in the mid '  s  and I look at kids now  and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework  more tutoring  more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago. And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout  pleading with me to write to their parents  to help them slow down  to help them get off this full throttle treadmill. But thankfully  there is a backlash there in parenting as well  and you're finding that  you know  towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month  so that people can  you know  decompress and have some family time  and slow down. Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years  and now they're discovering that less can be more. So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee paying  high achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of     and the high achieving parents freaked out and said   What are you    you know  our kids will fall     the headmaster said   No  no  your children need to slow down at the end of the day.  And just this last month  the exam results came in  and in math  science  marks went up    percent on average last year. And I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities  who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much  are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks  they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars  to the point that would make your eyes water. But they lack spark  they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside    they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools  and Oxford and Cambridge and so on  are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit. And in Harvard  for instance  they send out a letter to undergraduates    freshmen    telling them that they'll get more out of life  and more out of Harvard  if they put on the brakes  if they do less  but give time to things  the time that things need  to enjoy them  to savor them. And even if they sometimes do nothing at all. And that letter is called    very revealing  I think     Slow Down      with an exclamation mark on the end. So wherever you look  the message  it seems to me  is the same  that less is very often more  that slower is very often better. But that said  of course  it's not that easy to slow down  is it  I mean  you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness  and that's true  but that's not all of it. I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time. And if that's not shaming enough  I got that ticket in Italy. And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway  you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going. But why is it so hard to slow down  I think there are various reasons. One is that speed is fun  you know  speed is sexy. It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up. I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension    that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger  deeper questions. We fill our head with distraction  with busyness  so that we don't have to ask  am I well  Am I happy  Are my children growing up right  Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf  Another reason    although I think  perhaps  the most powerful reason    why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.  Slow  is a dirty word in our culture. It's a byword for  lazy    slacker   for being somebody who gives up. You know   he's a bit slow.  It's actually synonymous with being stupid. I guess what the Slow Movement    the purpose of the Slow Movement  or its main goal  really  is to tackle that taboo  and to say that yes  sometimes slow is not the answer  that there is such a thing as  bad slow.  You know  I got stuck on the M    which is a ring road around London  recently  and spent three and a half hours there. And I can tell you  that's really bad slow. But the new idea  the sort of revolutionary idea  of the Slow Movement  is that there is such a thing as  good slow   too. And good slow is  you know  taking the time to eat a meal with your family  with the TV switched off. Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work. Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life. Now  one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out  is the reaction to it. And I knew that when my book on slowness came out  it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade  but it's also been taken up  with great gusto  by the corporate world    you know  business press  but also big companies and leadership organizations. Because people at the top of the chain  people like you  I think  are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system  there's too much busyness  and it's time to find  or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. Another encouraging sign  I think  is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world  in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status    China  Brazil  Thailand  Poland  and so on    these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement  many people in them  and there's a debate going on in their media  on the streets. Because I think they're looking at the West  and they're saying   Well  we like that aspect of what you've got  but we're not so sure about that.  So all of that said  is it  I guess  is it possible  That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible to slow down  And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes. And I present myself as Exhibit A  a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed aholic. I still love speed. You know  I live in London  and I work as a journalist  and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness  and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things. I play squash and ice hockey  two very fast sports  and I wouldn't give them up for the world. But I've also  over the last year or so  got in touch with my inner tortoise. And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously. My default mode is no longer to be a rush aholic. I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near  or at least not as much as I did before. I can actually hear it now  because I see my time is ticking off. And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier  healthier  more productive than I ever have. I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it. And perhaps  the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper  richer  stronger. And for me  I guess  the litmus test for whether this would work  and what it would mean  was always going to be bedtime stories  because that's sort of where the journey began. And there too the news is rosy. You know  at the end of the day  I go into my son's room. I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer  so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket  and I just slow down to his pace and we read. And because children have their own tempo and internal clock  they don't do quality time  where you schedule    minutes for them to open up to you. They need you to move at their rhythm. I find that    minutes into a story  you know  my son will suddenly say   You know  something happened in the playground today that really bothered me.  And we'll go off and have a conversation on that. And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to do list  something that I dreaded  because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly. It's become my reward at the end of the day  something I really cherish. And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon  which goes a little bit like this  a few months ago  I was getting ready to go on another book tour  and I had my bags packed. I was downstairs by the front door  and I was waiting for a taxi  and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it. He'd gone and stapled two cards  very like these  together  and put a sticker of his favorite character  Tintin  on the front. And he said to me  or he handed this to me  and I read it  and it said   To Daddy  love Benjamin.  And I thought   Aw  that's really sweet. Is that a good luck on the book tour card   And he said   No  no  no  Daddy    this is a card for being the best story reader in the world.  And I thought   Yeah  you know  this slowing down thing really does work.  Thank you very much. I have all my life wondered what  mind boggling  meant. After two days here  I declare myself boggled  and enormously impressed  and feel that you are one of the great hopes    not just for American achievement in science and technology  but for the whole world. I've come  however  on a special mission on behalf of my constituency  which are the    to the   th power    that's a million trillion    insects and other small creatures  and to make a plea for them. If we were to wipe out insects alone  just that group alone  on this planet    which we are trying hard to do    the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land. And within a few months. Now  how did I come to this particular position of advocacy  As a little boy  and through my teenage years  I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life. I had a butterfly period  a snake period  a bird period  a fish period  a cave period and finally and definitively  an ant period. By my college years  I was a devoted myrmecologist  a specialist on the biology of ants  but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on Earth in general    including all that it means to us as a species  how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it. Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition  crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you. My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama  on the Florida peninsula. As far back as I can remember  I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there. One day when I was only seven years old and fishing  I pulled a  pinfish   they're called  with sharp dorsal spines  up too hard and fast  and I blinded myself in one eye. I later discovered I was also hard of hearing  possibly congenitally  in the upper registers. So in planning to be a professional naturalist    I never considered anything else in my entire life    I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either. So I turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the thumb and forefinger  the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems  the little things  as I like to say  who run the world. In so doing  I reached a frontier of biology so strange  so rich  that it seemed as though it exists on another planet. In fact  we live on a mostly unexplored planet. The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science. In the last    years  thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology  biologists have  for example  added a full one third of the known frog and other amphibian species  to bring the current total to        and more continue to pour in. Two new kinds of whales have been discovered  along with two new antelopes  dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant    and even a distinct kind of gorilla. At the extreme opposite end of the size scale  the class of marine bacteria  the Prochlorococci    that will be on the final exam    although discovered only in       are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth  and moreover  responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean. These bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms    so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy. Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures. These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet. Consider the fungi    including mushrooms  rusts  molds and many disease causing organisms.        species are known to science  but more than  .  million have been estimated to exist. Consider the nematode roundworm  the most abundant of all animals. Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms    if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated  you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms. About        species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists  there could be hundreds of thousands of them  even millions  still unknown. This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria  which within just the last several years still were known from only about       species of bacteria worldwide. But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil  just a little handful of soil  in the    billion bacteria that would be there. It's been estimated that a single ton of soil    fertile soil    contains approximately four million species of bacteria  all unknown. So the question is  what are they all doing  The fact is  we don't know. We are living on a planet with a lot of activities  with reference to our living environment  done by faith and guess alone. Our lives depend upon these creatures. To take an example close to home  there are over     species of bacteria now known    friendly bacteria    living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria. At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for this occasion. And I'd like to show it. Assisted in this by Billie Holiday. And that may be just the beginning  The viruses  those quasi organisms among which are the prophages  the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria  are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology  a world unto themselves. What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved  although they're obviously of enormous importance to us. But this much we can say  the variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds  or is likely to exceed  that in all of the rest of life combined. Nowadays  in addressing microbial biodiversity  scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean. But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology. Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours. Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs    to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars. What will we find as we map the living world  as  finally  we get this underway seriously  As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals  birds  frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity  Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to compose  instead  two great domains of microorganisms  true bacteria and one celled organisms the archaea  which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota  the group that we belong to. Some serious biologists  and I count myself among them  have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms  one might    just might    find aliens among them. True aliens  stocks that arrived from outer space. They've had billions of years to do it  but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet. We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment  including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria. There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other. But each of these species  even the tiniest Prochlorococci  are masterpieces of evolution. Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years. Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives  interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine. We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence    and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy. My own epiphany as a conservationist came in       while a Harvard graduate student  searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba  ants that shine in the sunlight    metallic green or metallic blue  according to species  and one species  I discovered  metallic gold. I found my magical ants  but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on  and were then    and still are    being cut back. I realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique  marvelous animals and plants on that island    and this is true of practically every part of the world    which took millions of years to evolve  are in the process of disappearing forever. And so it is everywhere one looks. The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym  HIPPO   the animal hippo. H is for habitat destruction  including climate change forced by greenhouse gases. I is for the invasive species like the fire ants  the zebra mussels  broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country  and at an exponential rate    that's the I. The P  the first one in  HIPPO   is for pollution. The second is for continued population  human population expansion. And the final letter is O  for over harvesting    driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing. The HIPPO juggernaut we have created  if unabated  is destined    according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research    to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century. Human forced climate change alone    again  if unabated    could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades. What will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment is thus degraded  Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered  much of our environmental stability and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value    all thrown away. The loss will inflict a heavy price in wealth  security and yes  spirituality for all time to come  because previous cataclysms of this kind    the last one  that ended the age of dinosaurs    took  normally  five to    million years to repair. Sadly  our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered. For example  even in the United States  the         species known currently actually has been found to be only partial in coverage  it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology. Only about    percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status. Of the    percent evaluated     percent are classified as  in peril   that is  in danger of extinction. That's in the United States. We are  in short  flying blind into our environmental future. We urgently need to change this. We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it. We need to settle down before we wreck the planet. And we need that knowledge. This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project. It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable. So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters  and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk. I wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity. And let us call it the  Encyclopedia of Life.  What is the  Encyclopedia of Life   A concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously  It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world. Amateurs can do it also. It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species. It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone  on demand  anywhere in the world. I've written about this idea before  and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past. But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form  science has advanced. Technology has moved forward. Today  the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia  regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it  are within reach. Indeed  in the past year  a group of influential scientific institutions have begun mobilizing to realize this dream. I wish you would help them. Working together  we can make this real. The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications. It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness  and sense of human need. It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity. And most of all  it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started  for me personally     years ago  to search for life  to understand it and finally  above all  to preserve it. That is my wish. Thank you. As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible  standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out of body experience and a deer caught in the headlights  so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments by relying on words on paper  and I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done. I'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer. I was a student in the '  s  a time of social upheaval and questioning  and on a personal level  an awakening sense of idealism. The war in Vietnam was raging  the Civil Rights Movement was under way  and pictures had a powerful influence on me. Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing  and photographers were telling us another. I believed the photographers  and so did millions of other Americans. Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism. They not only recorded history  they helped change the course of history. Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and  as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience  change became not only possible  but inevitable. I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism  specifically visual journalism  can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies. It can give credit to sound decision making  adding momentum to success. In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction  it becomes a kind of intervention  assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior. It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact. What happens at ground level  far from the halls of power  happens to ordinary citizens one by one. And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view. It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice. And as a reaction  it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate  thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda  much as they would like to. Coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly. The press is certainly a business  and in order to survive it must be a successful business  but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility. Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified. On a higher plane  the press is a service industry  and the service it provides is awareness. Every story does not have to sell something. There's also a time to give. That was a tradition I wanted to follow. Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution    I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer. But I was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti war photograph. I'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues I've been involved in over the past    years. In       I went to Northern Ireland.    IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death in protest against conditions in jail. The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation. I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields  but right where people live. During the early '  s  I spent a lot of time in Central America  which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War. In Guatemala  the central government    controlled by a oligarchy of European decent    was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion  and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America  conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword. An anti Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua. A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard was left as a monument in a park in Managua  and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child. At the same time  a civil war was taking place in El Salvador  and again  the civilian population was caught up in the conflict. I've been covering the Palestinian Israeli conflict since     . This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada  in       when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army. In       the uprising escalated into an armed conflict  and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin. Without the political will to find common ground  the continual friction of tactic and counter tactic only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance  and perpetuates the cycle of violence. In the '  s  after the breakup of the Soviet Union  Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines  and civil war broke out between Bosnia  Croatia and Serbia. This is a scene of house to house fighting in Mostar  neighbor against neighbor. A bedroom  the place where people share intimacy  where life itself is conceived  became a battlefield. A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift morgue. Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or Bosnian soldiers killed in action. This was once a park. The Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now. At the same time in South Africa  after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison  the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid. One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger. I had to use it  channel its energy  turn it into something that would clarify my vision  instead of clouding it. In Transkei  I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood  of the Xhosa tribe. Teenage boys lived in isolation  their bodies covered with white clay. After several weeks  they washed off the white and took on the full responsibilities of men. It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa. Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline. Elsewhere in Africa there was famine. In Somalia  the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out. Farmers were driven off their land  and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen. Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction    primitive but extremely effective. Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated  slowly and painfully. The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief  and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved. American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments  but they were eventually drawn into the conflict  and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu  they were withdrawn. In southern Sudan  another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide. Again  international NGOs  united under the umbrella of the U.N.  staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved. I'm a witness  and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored. I also want it to be powerful and eloquent  and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people I'm photographing. This man was in an NGO feeding center  being helped as much as he could be helped. He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton  yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move. He had not given up  and if he didn't give up  how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope  In       after three months of covering the South African election  I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela  and it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen. It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer. The next day I left for Rwanda  and it was like taking the express elevator to hell. This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp. He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time  and he even turned his face toward the light  as if he wanted me to see him better. I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world. This time  maybe confused or discouraged by the military disaster in Somalia  the international community remained silent  and somewhere around         people were slaughtered by their own countrymen    sometimes their own neighbors    using farm implements as weapons. Perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in Bosnia and the failure in Rwanda  when Serbia attacked Kosovo  international action was taken much more decisively. NATO forces went in  and the Serbian army withdrew. Ethnic Albanians had been murdered  their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported. They were received in refugee camps set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia. The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home. The image reminded me of a cave painting  and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways. Between      and '    I covered the first two wars in Chechnya from inside Grozny. This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army. The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks  killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside. I found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line. My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well. After the fall of Ceausescu  I went to Romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children  where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions. Ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family  thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy. Children who couldn't be supported by their families were raised in government orphanages. Children with birth defects were labeled incurables  and confined for life to inhuman conditions. As reports began to surface  again international aid went in. Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes  I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution  where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population. An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust  and four out of five workers came down with cancer. After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia  I began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization. I spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident. When the story was published  unsolicited donations poured in. A trust fund was established  and the family now lives in a house in the countryside and all their basic necessities are taken care of. It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything. Journalism had provided a channel for people's natural sense of generosity  and the readers responded. I met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside  and ended up living in a train station. By the age of    or     they'd become beggars and drug addicts. The rural poor had become the urban poor  and in the process  they'd become invisible. These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett  isolated  waiting in the dark  but drawn to the light. Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army. The active ingredient was dioxin  an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities  and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation. In       I began documenting global health issues  concentrating first on AIDS in Africa. I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers. I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped  whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations. So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents  and a lot of children had been born with HIV. A hospital in Zambia. I began documenting the close connection between HIV AIDS and tuberculosis. This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia. My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs by shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with. I went to Congo with MSF  and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died  and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon. A malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program. In the fall of      I went to Darfur. This time I was on assignment for a magazine  but again worked closely with MSF. The international community still hasn't found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide. An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people. I've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America. This is a scene from New Orleans. A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun. This experience raised a lot of questions  among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available. In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama. I didn't see either of the planes hit  and when I glanced out my window  I saw the first tower burning  and I thought it might have been an accident. A few minutes later when I looked again and saw the second tower burning  I knew we were at war. In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero  I had a realization. I'd been photographing in the Islamic world since         not only in the Middle East  but also in Africa  Asia and Europe. At the time I was photographing in these different places  I thought I was covering separate stories  but on      history crystallized  and I understood I'd actually been covering a single story for more than    years  and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation. The central commercial district of Kabul  Afghanistan at the end of the civil war  shortly before the city fell to the Taliban. Land mine victims being helped at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo. A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine. I'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world from political oppression  civil war  foreign invasions  poverty  famine. I understood that in its suffering  the Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening  A Taliban fighter shot during a battle as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz. When war with Iraq was imminent  I realized the American troops would be very well covered  so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad. A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family. A day after American forces entered Baghdad  a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers and were cheered on by the crowds    a hopeful moment that was short lived. For the first time in years  Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to Karbala to observe Ashura  and I was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion. A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives. It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with  and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them. Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops  from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home. This is a helicopter medic giving CPR to a soldier who had been shot in the head. Military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history. The signature weapon of the war is the IED  and the signature wound is severe leg damage. After enduring extreme pain and trauma  the wounded face a grueling physical and psychological struggle in rehab. The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable. I tried to imagine myself in their place  and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss. Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results. One day in rehab someone  started talking about surfing and all these guys who'd never surfed before said   Hey  let's go.  And they went surfing. Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what's going on. Sometimes they put their lives on the line  because they believe your opinions and your influence matter. They aim their pictures at your best instincts  generosity  a sense of right and wrong  the ability and the willingness to identify with others  the refusal to accept the unacceptable. My TED wish  there's a vital story that needs to be told  and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era. Thank you very much. I thought in getting up to my TED wish I would try to begin by putting in  perspective what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do. We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent  but insufficient in three major ways. It is  first of all  profoundly unequal  half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day  a billion people with no access to clean water  two and a half billion no access to sanitation  a billion going to bed hungry every night  one in four deaths every year from AIDS  TB  malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water       percent of them under five years of age. Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing. In the United States  since      we've had five years of economic growth  five years of productivity growth in the workplace  but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent. The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent. So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us    which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living  enjoying this evening    is profoundly unequal. It is also unstable. Unstable because of the threats of terror  weapons of mass destruction  the spread of global disease and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago. And perhaps most important of all  it is unsustainable because of climate change  resource depletion and species destruction. When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren I hope to have  it is a world that moves away from unequal  unstable  unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities    locally  nationally and globally    that share the characteristics of all successful communities  a broadly shared  accessible set of opportunities  a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging. All easier said than done. When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago  I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on       I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders  but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with  went to school with  worked with  shared weekends with  shared meals with. In other words  they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity. It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the   st century. Into this mix  people like us  who are not in public office  have more power to do good than at any time in history  because more than half the world's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out. And even non democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion. Because primarily of the power of the Internet  people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree. When the tsunami hit South Asia  the United States contributed  .  billion dollars.    percent of our households gave. Half of them gave over the Internet. The median contribution was somewhere around    dollars. And thirdly  because of the rise of non governmental organizations. They  businesses  other citizens' groups  have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings. When I became president in       there were none of these organizations in Russia. There are now a couple of hundred thousand. None in India. There are now at least a half a million active. None in China. There are now         registered with the government  probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons. When I organized my foundation  and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation  and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on. I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty  fight disease  combat climate change  bridge the religious  racial and other divides that torment the world  but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more. You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs. And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort  and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight  Ira Magaziner  is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done. He's over there. When I got out of office and was asked to work  first in the Caribbean  to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis  generic drugs were available for about     dollars a person a year. If you bought them in vast bulks  you could get them at a little under     dollars. The first country we went to work in  the Bahamas  was paying       dollars for these drugs. The market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold. So the very first week we were working  we got the price down to     dollars. And all of a sudden  they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money. Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines  one of whom was cited in the film  and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy  because even at     dollars  these drugs were being sold on a high margin  low volume  uncertain payment basis. So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain  and went to a low margin  high volume  absolutely certain payment business. I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy. But the price went to     dollars from    . And pretty soon  the average price was     dollars. Now we can get it for about     dollars. Children's medicine was     dollars  because nobody could afford to buy any of it. We negotiated it down to    . Then  the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called UNITAID  got a bunch of other countries to help. That children's medicine is now    dollars a person a year. The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose  treat and care for people and deliver this medicine. We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America. We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools. We just reorganized the markets. And it occurred to me that in this whole non governmental world  somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets. And that is now what we're trying to do  and working with this large cities group to fight climate change  to negotiate huge  big  volume deals that will enable cities which generate    percent of the world's greenhouse gases  to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics. And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden  is a mystery to me. I think it's a bird's nest on the ground. When Al Gore won his well deserved Oscar for the  Inconvenient Truth  movie  I was thrilled  but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly. For those of you who saw  An Inconvenient Truth   the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one  which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going if we don't do anything  here's where they could go. And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory. We need a movie on those six categories. And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it. So we're trying to do that. So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do. Now we have taken on a second thing  and this gets to my wish. It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be    the pessimistic headlines may say  well  we can't do this  that or the other thing because of corruption    I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption  and feeds corruption. We now have the money  given these low prices  to distribute AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach. Today these low prices are available in the    countries where we work  and in a total of    countries  and about         people are getting the benefits of them. But the money is there to reach others. The systems are not there to reach the people. So what we have been trying to do  working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places    but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight    is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS  TB  malaria  other infectious diseases  maternal and child health  and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world  that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda  and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world. And the test is  one  will it do the job  Will it provide high quality care  And two  will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to    years  Because the longer I deal with these problems  the more convinced I am that we have to    whether it's economics  health  education  whatever    we have to build systems. And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight. You think about whatever your life has been  however many obstacles you have faced in your life  at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved. In a world with no systems  with chaos  everything becomes a guerilla struggle  and this predictability is not there. And it becomes almost impossible to save lives  educate kids  develop economies  whatever. The person  in my view  who has done the best job of this in the health care area  of building a system in a very poor area  is Dr. Paul Farmer  who  many of you know  has worked for now    years with his group  Partners in Health  primarily in Haiti where he started  but they've also worked in Russia  in Peru and other places around the world. As poor as Haiti is  in the area where Farmer's clinic is active    and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve    since       they have not lost one person to tuberculosis  not one. And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem  we wanted to build a healthcare network  because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in       and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day. So I rang up  asked Paul Farmer if he would help. Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country  number one  it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last    years  and number two  we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world. And so we have set about doing that. Now  we started working together    months ago. And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza  which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda  with a group that originally includes about         people. We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti  he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems  ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly  who work on bringing about health education  clean water and sanitation  providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it. The procedures that make this work have been perfected  as I said  by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last    years. Recently we did an evaluation of the first    months of our efforts in Rwanda. And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country  and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it. I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do. We have about     people around the world working in our AIDS program  some of them for nothing    just for transportation  room and board. And then we have others working in these other related programs. Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble  who is an unusually gifted woman  but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work. She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her   s. She was CEO of a successful e venture    she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures    and at    she decided she wanted to do something different with her life. So she now works full time on this for very little pay. She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. When we came to this rural area     percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition.    percent of them died before they reached the age of five. Mortality at birth was over two and a half percent. Over    percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation    all entirely preventable and treatable. Over    percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses    again  all preventable and treatable. And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis. Within the first    months  the following things happened  we went from zero to about       people being treated for AIDS. That's    percent of the people who need treatment in this area. Listen to this  less than four tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment. That's lower than the figure in the United States. Less than three tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second line drugs.         pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system. That's about    percent of all the pregnancies. About    percent of all the people    I said        . I meant       . About    percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it    in just    months  up from zero when we started.    percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow. We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there. Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics  complete with solar power generators  good lab technology. We now are treating     people a month  despite the fact that almost     percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home. And the most important thing is because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model  using community health workers  we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda for between five and six percent of GDP  and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years. And for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and    percent of GDP on health care  except for the United States  we spend       but that's a story for another day. We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and our Foundation folks to scale this system up. We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho. And we have similar projects in Tanzania  Mozambique  Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing  to save as many lives as quickly as we can  but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world. We need initial upfront investment to train doctors  nurses  health administration and community health workers throughout the country  to set up the information technology  the solar energy  the water and sanitation  the transportation infrastructure. But over a five  to    year period  we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out. My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build a high quality rural health system in a poor country  Rwanda  that can be a model for Africa  and indeed  for any poor country anywhere in the world. My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world with more partners and fewer terrorists  with more productive citizens and fewer haters  a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in. It has been an honor for me  particularly  to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter  the Scottish philanthropist  where last year we  using the same thing with AIDS drugs  cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by    percent and achieved three  to four hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers. These people have been through a lot and none of us  most of all me  helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other. We're undoing that now  and they are so over it and so into their future. We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way. I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the    percent of the people that have no access  but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects  the Rwandans  interestingly enough  have been quite good  Mr. Wilson  in preserving their topsoil. There's a couple of guys from southern farming families    the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they'd done with it. We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation  reorganize itself  focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive  quality health care with minimal outside help. I am grateful for this prize  and I will use it to that end. We could use some more help to do this  but think of what it would mean if we could have a world class health system in Rwanda    in a country with a less than one dollar a day per capita income  one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth. It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed. Thank you and God bless you. What I want to talk about is  as background  is the idea that cars are art. This is actually quite meaningful to me  because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole    we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it    and cars are thought so much as a product that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art. And so cars  as art  brings it into an emotional plane    if you accept that    that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo. This is completely different than automobiles. Automobiles are self moving things  right  Elevators are automobiles. And they're not very emotional  they solve a purpose  and certainly automobiles have been around for     years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways  they've also been a real pain in the ass  because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve. We have to solve the pollution  we have to solve the congestion    but that's not what interests me in this speech. What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use  but cars are what we are  in many ways. And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles  and I believe we can  with fuel cells or hydrogen  like BMW is really hip on  and lots of other things  then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us    of this car y ness    and what that means  what we can learn from it. That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes  cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself  they take your thoughts  your ideas  your emotions  and they multiply it    your anger  whatever. It's an avatar. It's a super waldo that you happen to be inside of  and if you feel sexy  the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage  you've got a  Chevy  Like a Rock   right  Cars are a sculpture    did you know this  That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand. Many people think   Well  it's computers  and it's done by machines and stuff like that.  Well  they reproduce it  but the originals are all done by hand. It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft. And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum. That tension between the need to express  the need to discover  then you put something new into it  and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship. Rules that say  this is how you handle surfaces  this is what control is all about  this is how you show you're a master of your craft. And that tension  that discovery  that push for something new    and at the same time  that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship    that's as strong in cars as it is in anything. We work in clay  which hasn't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it  and there's a very interesting analogy to that too. Real quickly    Michelangelo once said he's there to  discover the figure within   OK  There we go  the automobile. That was     years right there    did you catch that  Between that one there  and that one there  it changed a lot didn't it  OK  it's not marketing  there's a very interesting car concept here  but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here. I want to talk about this. Why it means you have to wash a car  what is it  that sensuality you have to touch about it  That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality. And it's done by men and women working just like this  making cars. Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore  I believe that that  pressure within  that Moore's talking about    at least when it comes to cars    comes right back to this idea of the mean. It's that will to live  that need to survive  to express itself  that comes in a car  and takes over people like me. And we tell other people   Do this  do this  do this   until this thing comes alive. We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result of this infectiousness  it's quite wonderful. This sculpture is  of course  at the heart of all of it  and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars. And it's not a whole lot different  really  when they're working like this  or when somebody works like this. It's that same kind of commitment  that same kind of beauty. Now  now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art. Art  in the Platonic sense  is truth  it's beauty  and love. Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers. We don't really have a problem talking about love. We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense. That's what we're searching for    when we're working our craft  we are really trying to find that truth out there. We're not trying to find vanity and beauty. We're trying to find the beauty in the truth. However  engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian  instead of this quantum approach. We're dealing with irrationalisms  and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist  and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four  and if you get  .  it's better  and  .    is even better. And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing. We've pretty much accepted the fact  though  that we are the women in the organization at BMW    BMW is a very manly type business     men  men  men  it's engineers. And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK  that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female. Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function. We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic  it's really a truth. And I think this idea of soul  as being at the heart of great cars  is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it  with soul. You know how strong this is. Well  this experience of love  and the experience of design  to me  are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story. I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue. And first of all  you have to go with me for a second  and say  you know  you could take the word  love  out of a lot of things in our society  put the word  design  in  and it still works  like this quote here  you know. It kind of works  you know  You can understand that. It works in truisms.  All is fair in design and war.  Certainly we live in a competitive society. I think this one here  there's a pop song that really describes Philippe Starck for me  you know  this is like you know  this is like puppy love  you know  this is cool right  Toothbrush  cool. It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK  This is one substitution that I believe all of us  in design management  are guilty of. And this idea that there is more to love  more to design  when it gets down to your neighbor  your other  it can be physical like this  and maybe in the future it will be. But right now it's in dealing with our own people  our own teams who are doing the creating. So  to my story. The idea of people work is what we work with here  and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs. We have to have a shared intimacy  a shared vision    that means we have to work as one family  we have to understand ourselves that way. There's good times  there's interesting times  and there's some stress times too. You want to do cars  you've got to go outside. You've got to do cars in the rain  you've got to do cars in the snow. That's  by the way  is a presentation we made to our board of directors. We haul their butts out in the snow  too. You want to know cars outside  Well  you've got to stand outside to do this. And because these are artists  they have very artistic temperaments. All right  Now one thing about art is  art is discovery  and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right  And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion  we are completely in love with our own creations. This is one of my favorite paintings  it really describes our relationship with cars. This is sick beyond belief. But because of this  the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension  a new meaning. We have a shared center  we have a shared focus    that car stays at the middle of all our relationships. And it's my job  in the competitive process  to narrow this down. I heard today about Joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction. You know  that's what I have to do sometimes. We start out with    cars  we narrow it down to five cars  down to three cars  down to two cars  down to one car  and I'm in the middle of that killing  basically. Someone's love  someone's baby. This is very difficult  and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this  because their life is wrapped up in that too. They've got that gene infected in them as well  and they want that to live  more than anything else. Well  this project  Deep Blue  put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected  and I want to pass it on to you  because I want you to reflect on this  perhaps in your own relationships. We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW. We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it  that I only had a phone number that connected me to them. So  what we did was  instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist  we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America. This is      we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name  Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM    we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers. It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue  in a company like BMW  has a hook     Deep Blue   wow  cool name. So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers  and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget  what we thought was a set of deliverables  a timetable  and nothing else. Like I said  I just had a phone number that connected me to them. And a group of engineers worked in Germany  and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV. They would come together  compare notes. Then they would work apart  come together  and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas    but at the same time came together and resolved the problems. Hopefully  really understand the customer at its heart  where the customer is  live with them in America. So    sent the team off  and actually something different happened. They went other places. They disappeared  quite honestly  and all I got was postcards. Now  I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas  and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon  and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls  and pretty soon they're in New York  and I don't know where else. And I'm telling myself   This is going to be a great car  they're doing research that I've never even thought about before.  Right  And they decided that instead of  like  having a studio  and six or seven apartments  it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex house in Malibu. And    at least they told me it was her house  I guess it was at one time  she had a party there or something. But anyway  this was the house  and they all lived there. Now this is      living  half a dozen people who'd left their    some had left their wives behind and families behind  and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America  but the first three months were the most intensive. And one of the young women in the project  she was a fantastic lady  she actually built her room in the bathroom. The bathroom was so big  she built the bed over the bathtub    it's quite fascinating. On the other hand  I didn't know anything about this. OK  Nothing. This is all going on  and all I'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas  or whatever  saying   Don't worry Chris  this is really going to be good.  OK  So my concept of what a design studio was probably    I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were. However  the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution  and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin  and  you know  these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer. And one was hoping that these two teams would get together  and this collusion of incredible creativity  under these incredible surroundings  and these incredibly stressed out engineers  would create some incredible solutions. Well  what I didn't know was  and what we found out was    these guys  they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions. You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point  you have a split in your dialog that is so deep  and so far  that they cannot bring this together at all. And so we had our first meeting  after three months  in Tiburon  which is just up the road from here    you know Tiburon  And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Goschel    who is now my boss  and at that time he was co mentor on the project    and they would present their results. We would see where we were going  we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America. And so I had these ideas in my head  that this is going to be great. I mean  I'm going to see so much work  it's so intense    I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it  and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either    but somehow all this is going to come together  and I'm going to see some really great product. So we went to Tiburon  after three months  and the team had gotten together the week before  many days ahead of time. The engineers flew over  and designers got together with them  and they put their presentation together. Well  it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything. And they hadn't done anything because    kind of  like in car business  engineers are there to solve problems  and we were asking them to create a problem. And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say   This is the problem that we've created  now help us solve it.  And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was  the engineers showed up with nothing. And the engineers told the designers   If you go in with all your stuff  we'll walk out  we'll walk right out of the project.  So I didn't know any of this  and we got a presentation that had an agenda  looked like this. There was a whole lot of dialog. We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers. And here I'm expecting at any moment   OK  they're going to turn the page  and I'm going to see the cars  I'm going to see the sketches  I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going.  Dialog kept on going  with mental maps of words  and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance  I was seriously being baffled with bullshit. And if you can imagine what this is like  to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working  and they're out there spending all this money  and they're learning  and they're doing all this stuff. I went fucking ballistic  right  I went nuts. You can probably remember Tiburon  it used to look like this. After four hours of this  I stood up  and I took this team apart. I screamed at them  I yelled at them   What the hell are you doing  You're letting me down  you're my designers  you're supposed to be the creative ones  what the hell is going on around here   It was probably one of my better tirades  I have some good ones  but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people  how could they take BMW's money  how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing  nothing  Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings  model concepts  pictures    everything I wanted  they'd locked up in the cars  because they had shown solidarity with the engineers    and they'd decided not to show me anything  in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start  because they hadn't realized  of course  that they couldn't do problem creating. So we went to lunch    And I've got to tell you  this was one seriously quiet lunch. The engineers all sat at one end of the table  the designers and I sat at the other end of the table  really quiet. And I was just fucking furious  furious. OK  Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't  you know. That's what you get furious about right  And somebody asked me about Catherine  my wife  you know  did she fly out with me or something  I said   No   and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife. And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married  the priest gave a very nice sermon  and he said something very important. He said   Love is not selfish   he said   Love does not mean counting how many times I say  'I love you.' It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month  and it's two times less than last month  so that means you don't love me as much. Love is not selfish.  And I thought about this  and I thought   You know  I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love. I'm in the air  I'm in the air without trust. This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches  and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team. This cannot be.  So I told them this story. I said   Guys  I'm thinking about something here  this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one. Based on a dictate premise that says  'I'm a boss  you do what I say  without trust.'  I said  This can't be.  Actually  we all broke down into tears  to be quite honest about it  because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them  not being able to show me what I wanted  and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come. And I think we felt much closer that day  we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there  and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about. We put the car back at the center of our thoughts  and we put love  I think  truly back into the center of the process. By the way  that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SUVs in America. One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes    you see it downstairs  the X Coupe    they had a lot of fun with that. It was the rendition of our motorcycle  the GS  as Carl Magnusson says   brute iful   as the idea of what could be a motorcycle  if you add two more wheels. And so  in conclusion  my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you  was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of  Little Prince.  There's a lot to be said about trust and love  if you know that those two words are synonymous for design. I had a very  very meaningful relationship with my team that day  and it's stayed that way ever since. And I hope that you too find that there's more to design  and more towards the art of the design  than doing it yourself. It's true that the trust and the love  that makes it worthwhile. Thanks so much. At the break  I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate. And this will be my only comment on it. And that is  I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists. What I'm going to tell you about in my    minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves. It's only    years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free living organism  that of haemophilus influenzae. That took a genome project from    years down to four months. We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours. So in the last decade  a large number of genomes have been added  most human pathogens  a couple of plants  several insects and several mammals  including the human genome. Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over    years ago was  by the end of this year  we might have between three and five genomes sequenced  it's on the order of several hundred. We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence     genomes this year  as a side project from environmental organisms. So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed. But as we look  what's out there  we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet. Most people don't realize it  because they're invisible  but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass  whereas all animals only make up about one one thousandth of all the biomass. And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often  but if you ever make it to the sea  and you swallow a mouthful of seawater  keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of    million viruses. Less than       microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago  and so we decided to do something about it. And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition  where we were  as with great oceanographic expeditions  trying to sample the ocean every     miles. We started in Bermuda for our test project  then moved up to Halifax  working down the U.S. East Coast  the Caribbean Sea  the Panama Canal  through to the Galapagos  then across the Pacific  and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean. It's very tough duty  we're doing this on a sailing vessel  in part to help excite young people about going into science. The experiments are incredibly simple. We just take seawater and we filter it  and we collect different size organisms on different filters  and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville  where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every    hours. And with doing this  we've made some amazing discoveries. For example  it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes    there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments. It turns out  almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors  and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication. From one site  from one barrel of seawater  we discovered  .  million new genes and as many as        new species. We've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation. We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day  particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums. We filter through some simple apparatuses  we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City. And we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time. Just on the data collection side  just where we are through the Galapagos  we're finding that almost every     miles  we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean. Some of these make logical sense  in terms of different temperature gradients. So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures    red being warm  blue being cold    and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples  in terms of abundant species. The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light  and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence. And these vary tremendously from region to region. Maybe not surprisingly  in the deep ocean  where it's mostly blue  the photoreceptors tend to see blue light. When there's a lot of chlorophyll around  they see a lot of green light. But they vary even more  possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes. Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was  we assembled all the data    including all of ours thus far from the expedition  which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet    and it totaled around    million genes. And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are  Are we just discovering new members of known families  or are we discovering new families  And it turns out we have about        major gene families  but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families. So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes  components and life on this planet. When we look at the so called evolutionary tree  we're up on the upper right hand corner with the animals. Of those roughly    million genes  we only have around        in our genome. And if you take all animals together  we probably share less than        and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families. I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution. And we think in a gene centric view    maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas    than in a genome centric view  which are different constructs of these gene components. Synthetic DNA  the ability to synthesize DNA  has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two  and is getting very rapid and very cheap. Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in       and that from mycoplasma genitalium. And we have really nice T shirts that say  you know   I heart my genitalium.  This is actually just a microorganism. But it has roughly     genes. Haemophilus had       genes. And we simply asked the question  if one species needs      another      is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system  So we started doing transposon mutagenesis. Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code. And if they insert in the middle of the gene  they disrupt its function. So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those  non essential genes.  But it turns out the environment is very critical for this  and you can only define an essential or non essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment. We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of    related organisms  and we tried to compare all of those  to see what they had in common. And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only     genes common to all    organisms. The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite  it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around     or so. So we think that we can expand or contract genomes  depending on your point of view here  to maybe     to     genes from the minimal of    . The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them  and we had to do this in a cassette based fashion. We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult. Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison  my colleagues on this  developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a       base pair virus in only a two week period that was     percent accurate  in terms of its sequence and its biology. It was a quite exciting experiment    when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA  injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden  that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria. This was not the first synthetic virus    a polio virus had been made a year before    but it was only one ten thousandth as active and it took three years to do. This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X    . This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware  and that's the notions that we have with biology. People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare  and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee  and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area. And I think it's important to keep reality in mind  versus what happens with people's imaginations. Basically  any virus that's been sequenced today    that genome can be made. And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox  but the DNA from this organism is not infective. So even if somebody made the smallpox genome  that DNA itself would not cause infections. The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses. And there's only two countries  the U.S. and the former Soviet Union  that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents. If that research is truly discontinued  there should be very little activity on the know how to make designer viruses in the future. I think single cell organisms are possible within two years. And possibly eukaryotic cells  those that we have  are possible within a decade. So we're now making several dozen different constructs  because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome. The key is  how do you put all of the others  We start with these fragments  and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome. This is derived from an organism  deinococcus radiodurans  that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed. It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about    to    hours  after its chromosomes are literally blown apart. This organism is ubiquitous on the planet  and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there. This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation. The glass started to burn and crack  while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier. Here's an actual picture of what happens  the top of this shows the genome after  .  million rads of radiation. The chromosome is literally blown apart. And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled    hours later. It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that  and we probably have thousands  if not tens of thousands  of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that. After these genomes are synthesized  the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome. So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential  not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues. For example  from the third organism we sequenced  Methanococcus jannaschii    it lives in boiling water temperatures  its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO  it captures back from the environment. So we know lots of different pathways  thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO   and can capture that back. So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes  we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere  converting that into biopolymers or other products. We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide  and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Also  there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane. And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products. Within a short while  I think there's going to be a new field called  Combinatorial Genomics   because with these new synthesis capabilities  these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination  we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day. And therefore  as with all biology  you get selection through screening  whether you're screening for hydrogen production  or chemical production  or just viability. To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach. We're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight. Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen  and we have an oxygen insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process. We're also combining cellulases  the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol. Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes. The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce. I think future engineered species could be the source of food  hopefully a source of energy  environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry. Let me just close with ethical and policy studies. We delayed the start of our experiments in      until we completed a year and a half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species. Every major religion participated in this. It was actually a very strange study  because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books  and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life  so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this  but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them. Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi institutional study on this  to work out what the risk and benefits to society are  and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area  and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward. These are complex issues. Except for the threat of bio terrorism  they're very simple issues in terms of  can we design things to produce clean energy  perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes. Thank you very much. As you pointed out  every time you come here  you learn something. This morning  the world's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats  I think concluded that ultimately  the solution is  people shouldn't sit down. I could have told them that. Yesterday  the automotive guys gave us some new insights. They pointed out that  I believe it was between    and    years from today  they will be steering cars by wire  without all that mechanical stuff. That's reassuring. They then pointed out that there'd be  sort of  the other controls by wire  to get rid of all that mechanical stuff. That's pretty good  but why not get rid of the wires  Then you don't need anything to control the car  except thinking about it. I would love to talk about the technology  and sometime  in what's past the    minutes  I'll be happy to talk to all the techno geeks around here about what's in here. But if I had one thing to say about this  before we get to first  it would be that from the time we started building this  the big idea wasn't the technology. It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community. The big idea here is  I think  a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation. And maybe to put that in perspective  there's so much data on this  I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms. You never know what strikes the fancy of whom  but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world. And Henry Ford  just about     years ago  started cranking out Model Ts. What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied. For instance  in that time     percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns. So  the car    the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage    was a big deal  it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage. It was half as long. And it was an environmental improvement  because  for instance  in      they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan  because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses  and a million of them urinating and doing other things  and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable. So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy. It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm  or their farm to a town  or from a town to a city. It all made sense  with    percent of the people living there. By the     s  we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world  the highway system. And it is certainly a wonder. And by the way  as I take shots at old technologies  I want to assure everybody  and particularly the automotive industry    who's been very supportive of us    that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes  or cars. But think about where the world is today.    percent of the global population now lives in cities. That's  .  billion people. We've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.     years ago  sailing ships started getting reliable enough  we found a new continent.     years ago  locomotives got efficient enough  steam power  that we turned the continent into a country. Over the last hundred years  we started building cars  and then over the    years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way  and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that. But during that entire process  more and more people have been born  and more and more people are moving to cities. China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half. And so  nobody  I think  would argue that airplanes  in the last    years  have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood. And if you just look at how technology has been applied  we've solved all the long range  high speed  high volume  large weight problems of moving things around. Nobody would want to give them up. And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane  or my helicopter  or my Humvee  or my Porsche. I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room. The fact is  the last mile is the problem  and half the world now lives in dense cities. And people spend  depending on who they are  between    and    percent of their energy getting around on foot. I think there's    I don't know what data would impress you  but how about     percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States. Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air  and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices  particularly sitting in cities. And again  I say that not to attack any industry  I think    I really do    I love my airplane  and cars on highways moving    miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient  both from an engineering point of view  an energy consumption point of view  and a utility point of view. And we all love our cars  and I do. The problem is  you get into the city and you want to go four blocks  it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive. It's not sustainable. If    in China  in the year           million people used bicycles   .  million people used cars. If five percent of that population became  quote  middle class  and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that    percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan  every six weeks    it isn't sustainable environmentally  it isn't sustainable economically    there just ain't enough oil    and it's not sustainable politically. I mean  what are we fighting over right now  We can make it complicated  but what's the world fighting over right now  So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile  and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs  but once we made this  we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water. Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow. Or skiing. It's just fun  and people love to move around doing fun things. And every one of those industries  by the way    just golf carts alone is a multi billion dollar industry. But rather than go license this off  which is what we normally do  it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology  but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems  but has somehow come to accept that cities    which  right back from ancient Greece on  were meant to walk around  cities that were architected and built for people    now have a footprint that  while we've solved every other transportation problem    and it's like Moore's law. I mean  look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon  then on a railroad  then an airplane. Every other form of transportation's been improved. In       years  we've gone backwards in getting around cities. They've gotten bigger  they're spread out. The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city    Wilshire Boulevard  or Fifth Avenue  or Tokyo  or Paris    the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.    percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars. The    largest cities in the world. So you wonder  what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities  What if you could make them fun  attractive  clean  environmentally friendly  What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this  as that last link to mass transit  to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want  and then have our cities energized again  We thought it would be really neat to do that  and one of the problems we really were worried about is  how do we get legal on the sidewalk  Because technically I've got motors  I've got wheels    I'm a motor vehicle. I don't look like a motor vehicle. I have the same footprint as a pedestrian  I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space. I took this down to Ground Zero  and knocked my way through crowds for an hour. I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two  and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk  we have two choices. We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter  and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff. Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle. We've been so concerned about that  we went to the Postmaster General of the United States  as the first person we ever showed on the outside  and said   Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman. And they belong on the sidewalks  and they'll use it seriously.  He agreed. We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat  carrying    pounds of stuff. They love it. And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket. So we've been working really  really hard  but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important  and how to apply the technology. We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things  and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted. So  I'm happy  really  I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want. And yes  it's really fun  and yes  you should all go out and try it. But if I could ask you to do one thing  it's not to think about it as a piece of technology  but just imagine that  although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our       pound machine  which can go    miles an hour  that can bring you everywhere you want to go  and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile  and it's broken  and it doesn't work. One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted  happened out here in California. A few weeks ago  after we launched it  we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach  zipping up and back  and he's marveling at the technology  and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by  and skateboarders are zipping by  and a little old lady    I mean  if you looked in the dictionary  a little old lady    came by me    and now that I'm on this  I'm the height of a normal adult now    and she just stops  and the camera is there  and she looks up at me and says   Can I try that   And what was I    you know  how are you going to say anything  And so I said   Sure.  So I get off  and she gets on  and with a little bit of the usual  ah  then she turns around  and she goes about    feet  and she turns back around  and she's all smiles. And she comes back to me and she stops  and she says   Finally  they made something for us.  And the camera is looking down at her. I'm thinking   Wow  that was great       please lady  don't say another word.  And the camera is down at her  and this guy has to put the microphone in her face  said   What do you mean by that   And I figured   It's all over now   and she looks up and she says   Well   she's still watching these guys go  she says   I can't ride a bike   no  she says   I can't use a skateboard  and I've never used roller blades   she knew them by name  she says   And it's been    years since I rode a bicycle.  Then she looks up  she's looking up  and she says   And I'm    years old  and I don't drive a car anymore. I still have to get to the store  and I can't carry a lot of things.  And it suddenly occurred to me  that among my many fears  were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it    it was that  fundamentally  you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left  the sidewalks in these cities. When you look at the    inches of legal requirement for sidewalk  then the eight foot for the parked car  then the three lanes  and then the other eight feet    it's    that little piece is all that's there. But she looks up and says this  and it occurs to me  well  kids aren't going to mind these things  and they don't vote  and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things    they're pretty cool    so I guess subliminally I was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry. So  having seen this  and having worried about it for eight years  the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys  call AARP  get an appointment right away. We've got to show them this thing. And they took it to Washington  they showed them  and they're going to be involved now  watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities  like Atlanta  where we're doing trials to see if it really can  in fact  help re energize their downtown. The bottom line is  whether you believe the United Nations  or any of the other think tanks    in the next    years  all human population growth on this planet will be in cities. In Asia alone  it will be over a billion people. They learned to start with cell phones. They didn't have to take the     year trip we took. They start at the top of the technology food chain. We've got to start building cities and human environments where a     pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense  rich  green space environment  without being in a       pound machine to do it. Cars were not meant for parallel parking  they're wonderful machines to go between cities  but just think about it  we've solved all the long range  high speed problems. The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals. You do it in your sneakers. Not much has changed. If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking    three times    a    minute walk becomes    minutes. Your choice  when living in a city  if it's now    minutes    because at    minutes you want an alternative  whether it's a bus  a train    we've got to build an infrastructure    a light rail    or you're going to keep parking those cars. But if you could put a pin in most cities  and imagine how far you could  if you had the time  walk in one half hour  it's the city. If you could make it fun  and make it eight or    minutes  you can't find your car  un park your car  move your car  re park your car and go somewhere  you can't get to a cab or a subway. We could change the way people allocate their resources  the way this planet uses its energy  make it more fun. And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right. That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine  this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing. This little beast  right now  is producing a few hundred watts of electricity. Yes  it could be attached to this  and yes  on a kilogram of propane  you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose. Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel  because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact  where most of the world you can't simply plug into your     volt outlet. We've been working on this  actually  as an alternative energy source  starting way back with Johnson   Johnson  to run an iBOT  because the best batteries you could get       watt hours per kilogram in lead     watt hours per kilogram nickel cadmium     watt hours per kilogram in nickel metal hydride     watt hours per kilogram in lithium        watt hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline    which is why nobody drives electric cars. But  in any event  if you can burn it with the same efficiency    because it's external combustion    as your kitchen stove  if you can burn any fuel  it turns out to be pretty neat. It makes just enough electricity to  for instance  do this  which at night is enough electricity  in the rest of the world  as Mr. Holly    Dr. Holly    pointed out  can run computers and a light bulb. But more interestingly  the thermodynamics of this say  you're never going to get more than    percent efficiency. It doesn't matter much    it says if you get     watts of electricity  you'll get     or     watts of heat. If you wanted to boil water and re condense it at a rate of    gallons an hour  it takes about     a little over   .  kilowatt           watts of continuous power    to do it. That's so much energy  you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way. Certainly  in the rest of the world  your choice is to devastate the place  turning everything that will burn into heat  or drink the water that's available. The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water. Depending on whose numbers you believe  it's between    and        people per day. We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world. We need water. And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it  or watching their kids die. We figured out how to put a vapor compression distiller on this thing  with a counter flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat  then using a little bit of the electricity control that process  and for     watts  which is a little more than half of its waste heat  it will make    gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it. So if we put this box on here in a few years  could we have a solution to transportation  electricity  and communication  and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs    pounds  I don't know  but we'll try it. I better shut up. Good morning everyone. First of all  it's been fantastic being here over these past few days. And secondly  I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people  these amazing talks that we've had. I feel that I've fitted in  in many ways  to some of the things that I've heard. I came directly here from the deep  deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador  where I was out    you could only get there by a plane    with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses  where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies  and keep the roads  out of their forests. They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean  a world that isn't contaminated  a world that isn't polluted. And what was so amazing to me  and what fits right in with what we're all talking about here at TED  is that there  right in the middle of this rainforest  was some solar panels    the first in that part of Ecuador    and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn't have to go down. The water was cleaned  but because they got a lot of batteries  they were able to store a lot of electricity. So every house    and there were  I think  eight houses in this little community    could have light for  I think it was about half an hour each evening. And there is the Chief  in all his regal finery  with a laptop computer. And this man  he has been outside  but he's gone back  and he was saying   You know  we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era  and we didn't even know about the white man    years ago  and now here we are with laptop computers  and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world. We want to know about health care. We want to know about what other people do    we're interested in it. And we want to learn other languages. We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese  and we're good at languages.  So there he is with his little laptop computer  but fighting against the might of the pressures    because of the debt  the foreign debt of Ecuador    fighting the pressure of World Bank  IMF  and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil. And so  coming directly from there to here. But  of course  my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization    I can't really call it a civilization. A different way of life  a different being. We've talked earlier    this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different cultures of the humans around the world    but the world is not composed only of human beings  there are also other animal beings. And I propose to bring into this TED conference  as I always do around the world  the voice of the animal kingdom. Too often we just see a few slides  or a bit of film  but these beings have voices that mean something. And so  I want to give you a greeting  as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania    Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since     . During that time  there have been modern technologies that have really transformed the way that field biologists do their work. For example  for the first time  a few years ago  by simply collecting little fecal samples we were able to have them analyzed    to have DNA profiling done    so for the first time  we actually know which male chimps are the fathers of each individual infant. Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society. So this opens up a whole new avenue of research. And we use GSI    geographic whatever it is  GSI    to determine the range of the chimps. And we're using    you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff    but we're using satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area. And of course  there's developments in infrared  so you can watch animals at night  and equipment for recording by video  and tape recording is getting lighter and better. So in many  many ways  we can do things today that we couldn't do when I began in     . Especially when chimpanzees  and other animals with large brains  are studied in captivity  modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non human animals. So that we know today  they're capable of performances that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when I began. I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan    her name means love    and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her. She loves her computer    she'll leave her big group  and her running water  and her trees and everything. And she'll come in to sit at this computer    it's like a video game for a kid  she's hooked. She's     by the way  and she does things with her computer screen and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans. She does very complex tasks  and I haven't got time to go into them  but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn't like making mistakes. If she has a bad run  and her score isn't good  she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass    because she can't see the experimenter    which is asking to have another go. And her concentration    she's already concentrated hard for    minutes or so  and now she wants to do it all over again  just for the satisfaction of having done it better. And the food is not important    she does get a tiny reward  like one raisin for a correct response    but she will do it for nothing  if you tell her beforehand. So here we are  a chimpanzee using a computer. Chimpanzees  gorillas  orangutans also learn human sign language. But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in         I remember so well  so vividly  as though it was yesterday    the first time  when I was going through the vegetation  the chimpanzees were still running away from me  for the most part  although some were a little bit acclimatized    and I saw this dark shape  hunched over a termite mound  and I peered with my binoculars. It was  fortunately  one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard    and by the way  science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps  they should all have numbers  that was more scientific. Anyway  David Greybeard    and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest. And not only that    he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves    modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose    the beginning of tool making. The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time  it was thought that humans  and only humans  used and made tools. When I was at school  we were defined as man  the toolmaker. So that when Louis Leakey  my mentor  heard this news  he said   Ah  we must now redefine 'man ' redefine 'tool ' or accept chimpanzees as humans.  We now know that at Gombe alone  there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes. Moreover  we know that in different parts of Africa  wherever chimps have been studied  there are completely different tool using behaviors. And because it seems that these patterns are passed from one generation to the next  through observation  imitation and practice    that is a definition of human culture. What we find is that over these    odd years that I and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes  and  as I say  other mammals with complex brains and social systems  we have found that after all  there isn't a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. It's a very wuzzy line. It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things that we  in our arrogance  used to think was just human. The chimps    there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives    but they have this long childhood  five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother  and then another three  four or five years of emotional dependence on her  even when the next child is born. The importance of learning in that time  when behavior is flexible    and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society. The long term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother  with the brothers and sisters  and which can last through a lifetime  which may be up to    years. They can actually live longer than    in captivity  so we've only done    years in the wild so far. And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism. We find in their non verbal communication    this is very rich    they have a lot of sounds  which they use in different circumstances  but they also use touch  posture  gesture  and what do they do  They kiss  they embrace  they hold hands. They pat one another on the back  they swagger  they shake their fist    the kind of things that we do  and they do them in the same kind of context. They have very sophisticated cooperation. Sometimes they hunt    not that often  but when they hunt  they show sophisticated cooperation  and they share the prey. We find that they show emotions  similar to    maybe sometimes the same    as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness  sadness  fear  despair. They know mental as well as physical suffering. And I don't have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you  save to say that there are very bright students  in the best universities  studying emotions in animals  studying personalities in animals. We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors     self  as opposed to  other.  They have a sense of humor  and these are the kind of things which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives. But this teaches us a new respect    and it's a new respect not only for the chimpanzees  I suggest  but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet. Once we're prepared to admit that after all  we're not the only beings with personalities  minds and above all feelings  and then we start to think about ways we use and abuse so many other sentient  sapient creatures on this planet  it really gives cause for deep shame  at least for me. So  the sad thing is that these chimpanzees    who've perhaps taught us  more than any other creature  a little humility    are in the wild  disappearing very fast. They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well. The deforestation  the growth of human populations  needing more land. They're disappearing because some timber companies go in with clear cutting. They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads    as they want to do in Ecuador and other parts where the forests remain untouched    to take out oil or timber. And this has led in Congo basin  and other parts of the world  to what is known as the bush meat trade. This means that although for hundreds  perhaps thousands of years  people have lived in those forests  or whatever habitat it is  in harmony with their world  just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families    now  suddenly  because of the roads  the hunters can go in from the towns. They shoot everything  every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat  they sun dry it or smoke it. And now they've got transport  they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it. And people will pay more for bush meat  as it's called  than for domestic meat    it's culturally preferred. And it's not sustainable  and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat  so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who've lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted. They're given weapons  they shoot for the logging camps  they get money. Their culture is being destroyed  along with the animals upon whom they depend. So  when the logging camp moves  there's nothing left. We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity  and I've seen it happening with my own eyes. And the grim picture in Africa    I love Africa  and what do we see in Africa  We see deforestation  we see the desert spreading  we see massive hunger  we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support  and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere. Were the people that we heard about yesterday  on the Easter Island  who cut down their last tree    were they stupid  Didn't they know what was happening  Of course  but if you've seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn't a question of  Let's leave the tree for tomorrow.   How am I going to feed my family today  Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree which will keep us going a little bit longer  and then we'll pray that something will happen to save us from the inevitable end.  So  this is a pretty grim picture. The one thing we have  which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures  is this sophisticated spoken language    a language with which we can tell children about things that aren't here. We can talk about the distant past  plan for the distant future  discuss ideas with each other  so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group. We can do it by talking to each other  we can do it through video  we can do it through the written word. And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards  and we're destroying the world. In the developed world  in a way  it's worse  because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing. Do you know  we're bringing little babies into a world where  in many places  the water is poisoning them  And the air is harming them  and the food that's grown from the contaminated land is poisoning them. And that's not just in the far away developing world  that's everywhere. Do you know we all have about    chemicals in our bodies we didn't have about    years ago  And so many of these diseases  like asthma and certain kinds of cancers  are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped. We're harming ourselves around the world  as well as harming the animals  as well as harming nature herself    Mother Nature  that brought us into being  Mother Nature  where I believe we need to spend time  where there's trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development. And yet  there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature  because they're growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality  with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun  or in the forest  with the dappled sun specks coming down from the canopy above. As I was traveling around the world  you know  I had to leave the forest    that's where I love to be. I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because  finding they dwindled from about two million     years ago to about         now  I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world. And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight  the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected  and the problems of the developing world so often stem from the greed of the developed world  and everything was joining together  and making    not sense  hope lies in sense  you said    it's making a nonsense. How can we do it  Somebody said that yesterday. And as I was traveling around  I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope. They were feeling despair  they were feeling   Well  it doesn't matter what we do  eat  drink and be merry  for tomorrow we die. Everything is hopeless    we're always being told so by the media.  And then I met some who were angry  and anger that can turn to violence  and we're all familiar with that. And I have three little grandchildren  and when some of these students would say to me at high school or university  they'd say   We're angry   or  We're filled with despair  because we feel you've compromised our future  and there's nothing we can do about it.  And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren  and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age. I feel this deep shame  and that's why in      in Tanzania  I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots. There's little brochures all around outside  and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future  I beg that you pick up that brochure. And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny  but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls. See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet. Then  you see  it is a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through  and can make this a better world. And the most important message of Roots and Shoots is that every single individual makes a difference. Every individual has a role to play. Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday  and you scientists know that you can't actually    even if you stay in bed all day  you're breathing oxygen and giving out CO   and probably going to the loo  and things like that    you're making a difference in the world. So  the Roots and Shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects. And these are projects to make the world around them a better place. One project to show care and concern for your own human community. One for animals  including domestic animals    and I have to say  I learned everything I know about animal behavior even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog  Rusty  who was my childhood companion. And the third kind of project  something for the local environment. So what the kids do depends first of all  how old are they    and we go now from pre school right through university. It's going to depend whether they're inner city or rural. It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished. It's going to depend which part  say  of America they're in. We're in every state now  and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York. It's going to depend on which country they're in    and we're already in    plus countries  with about       active groups    and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of  because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves. Why  Because they're buying into it  and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do. It isn't something that their parents tell them  or their teachers tell them. That's effective  but if they decide themselves   We want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there. We want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have an organic garden. We want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories. We want to go and work in a dog shelter. We want to learn about animals. We want ...   You know  it goes on and on  and this is very hopeful for me. As I travel around the world     days a year  everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages. Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying   Look at the difference we've made.  And now comes the technology into it  because with this new way of communicating electronically these kids can communicate with each other around the world. And if anyone is interested to help us  we've got so many ideas but we need help    we need help to create the right kind of system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement. But also    and this is so important    to communicate their despair  to say   We've tried this and it doesn't work  and what shall we do   And then  lo and behold  there's another group answering these kids who may be in America  or maybe this is a group in Israel  saying   Yeah  you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it.  The philosophy is very simple. We do not believe in violence. No violence  no bombs  no guns. That's not the way to solve problems. Violence leads to violence  at least in my view. So how do we solve  The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding. Know the facts  but see how they fit in the big picture. Hard work and persistence   don't give up    and love and compassion leading to respect for all life. How many more minutes  Two  one  Chris Anderson  One    one to two. Jane Goodall  Two  two  I'm going to take two. Are you going to come and drag me off  Anyway    so basically  Roots and Shoots is beginning to change young people's lives. It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to. And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact  not just because you can share technology with us  but because so many of you have children. And if you take this program out  and give it to your children  they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good  because they've got parents like you. And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world a better place. It's very encouraging. But the kids do ask me    and this won't take more than two minutes  I promise    the kids say   Dr. Jane  do you really have hope for the future  You travel  you see all these horrible things happening.  Firstly  the human brain    I don't need to say anything about that. Now that we know what the problems are around the world  human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems. And we've talked a lot about that. Secondly  the resilience of nature. We can destroy a river  and we can bring it back to life. We can see a whole area desolated  and it can be brought back to bloom again  with time or a little help. And thirdly  the last speaker talked about    or the speaker before last  talked about the indomitable human spirit. We are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible. Nelson Mandela    I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison  where he labored for    years  and came out with so little bitterness  he could lead his people from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath. Even after the   th of September    and I was in New York and I felt the fear    nevertheless  there was so much human courage  so much love and so much compassion. And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear    the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn't worry about the environment any more  in case they seemed not to be patriotic    and I was trying to encourage them  somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi   If you look back through human history  you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.  And just after that a woman brought me this little bell  and I want to end on this note. She said   If you're talking about hope and peace  ring this. This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine  from the killing fields of Pol Pot    one of the most evil regimes in human history    where people are now beginning to put their lives back together after the regime has crumbled. So  yes  there is hope  and where is the hope  Is it out there with the politicians  It's in our hands. It's in your hands and my hands and those of our children. It's really up to us. We're the ones who can make a difference. If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints  if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not  we can change the world overnight. Thank you. Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories  only to find out that you're a performance artist. I'm also a software engineer  and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer. And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression. And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft  and in a way those are my bane  I think there's a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer. Of course  it's also a great liberating force that makes possible  you know  publishing and so forth  and standards  and so on. But  in a way  the computer makes possible much more than what most people think  and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer  and so I end up writing software to do that. Chris has asked me to do a short performance  and so I'm going to take just this time    maybe    minutes    to do that  and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form. Thank you. We've got about a minute left. I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project. I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths. And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica  we repeated it in England. And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen. We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were. And since we know where their heads are  and we have a wireless mic on them that we're processing the sound from  we're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech. This will take about    seconds or so. He's making a  kind of  cheek flapping sound. Well  suffice it to say it's not all like that  but that's part of it. Thanks very much. There's always lots more. I'm overtime  so I just wanted to say you can  if you're in New York  you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week  and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea. And with that  I think I should give up the stage  so  thank you so much. It is a thrill to be here at a conference that's devoted to  Inspired by Nature     you can imagine. And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section. Did you notice this section is foreplay  Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters  which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance. I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park  which is a long  skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it  and my partner and I have a rowing shell. And so we were rowing  and one of these Western Grebes came along. And what they do for their courtship dance is  they go together  the two of them  the two mates  and they begin to run underwater. They paddle faster  and faster  and faster  until they're going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water  and they're standing upright  sort of paddling the top of the water. And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing. And so we're in a skull  and we're moving really  really quickly. And this Grebe  I think  sort of  mistaked us for a prospect  and started to run along the water next to us  in a courtship dance    for miles. It would stop  and then start  and then stop  and then start. Now that is foreplay. I came this close to changing species at that moment. Obviously  life can teach us something in the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us. But what I'd like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design. What's happened since the book came out    the book was mainly about research in biomimicry    and what's happened since then is architects  designers  engineers    people who make our world    have started to call and say  we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help us  in real time  become inspired. Or    and this is the fun part for me    we want you to take us out into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world  who might inspire us. So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers  they purify wastewater. And some of them were very resistant  actually  to being there. What they said to us at first was  you know  we already do biomimicry. We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said  well  that's not exactly being inspired by nature. That's bioprocessing  you know  that's bio assisted technology  using an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old  old technology called  domestication.  This is learning something  learning an idea  from an organism and then applying it. And so they still weren't getting it. So we went for a walk on the beach and I said  well  give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge  sustainability speed bump  that's keeping you from being sustainable. And they said scaling  which is the build up of minerals inside of pipes. And they said  you know what happens is  mineral    just like at your house    mineral builds up. And then the aperture closes  and we have to flush the pipes with toxins  or we have to dig them up. So if we had some way to stop this scaling    and so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them  what is scaling  What's inside your pipes  And they said  calcium carbonate. And I said  that's what this is  this is calcium carbonate. And they didn't know that. They didn't know that what a seashell is  it's templated by proteins  and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell. So the same sort of a process  without the proteins  is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know. This is not for lack of information  it's a lack of integration. You know  it's a silo  people in silos. They didn't know that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it and said  OK  well  if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater    self assembly    then why aren't shells infinite in size  What stops the scaling  Why don't they just keep on going  And I said  well  in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization    and then they all sort of leaned in    they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization. It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal. And  in fact  there is a product called TPA that's mimicked that protein    that stop protein    and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes. That changed everything. From then on  you could not get these engineers back in the boat. The first day they would take a hike  and it was  click  click  click  click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat. We're done. You know  I've seen that island. After this  they were crawling all over. They would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel. What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve. Learning about the natural world is one thing  learning from the natural world    that's the switch. That's the profound switch. What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere  they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.  .  billion years of field testing.    to       Craig Venter will probably tell you  I think there's a lot more than    million    well adapted solutions. The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context. And the context is the Earth    the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in. So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius. It's not slavishly mimicking    although Al is trying to get the hairdo going    it's not a slavish mimicry  it's taking the design principles  the genius of the natural world  and learning something from it. Now  in a group with so many IT people  I do have to mention what I'm not going to talk about  and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things  on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves  like an immune system  and we're learning from gene regulation and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets  genetic algorithms  evolutionary computing. That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me is that we haven't looked at this  as much. I mean  these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens in the water in Silicon Valley. So the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success. So what can we learn about making    not just computers  but everything  The plane you came in  cars  the seats that you're sitting on. How do we redesign the world that we make  the human made world  More importantly  what should we ask in the next    years  And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has. What's the syllabus  Three questions  for me  are key. How does life make things  This is the opposite  this is how we make things. It's called heat  beat and treat    that's what material scientists call it. And it's carving things down from the top  with    percent waste left over and only   percent product. You heat it up  you beat it with high pressures  you use chemicals. OK. Heat  beat and treat. Life can't afford to do that. How does life make things  How does life make the most of things  That's a geranium pollen. And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape. Life adds information to matter. In other words  structure. It gives it information. By adding information to matter  it gives it a function that's different than without that structure. And thirdly  how does life make things disappear into systems  Because life doesn't really deal in things  there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems. Really quick syllabus. As I'm reading more and more now  and following the story  there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences. And at the same time  I'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are. The two groups are not talking to each other. At all. What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture  to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in  I'm going to try to go through     really quickly. One that's exciting to me is self assembly. Now  you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology. Back to that shell  the shell is a self assembling material. On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer  and it makes it very  very tough. It's twice as tough as our high tech ceramics. But what's really interesting  unlike our ceramics that are in kilns  it happens in seawater. It happens near  in and near  the organism's body. This is Sandia National Labs. A guy named Jeff Brinker has found a way to have a self assembling coding process. Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something into a liquid  lifting it out of the liquid  and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together  so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works. Imagine making all of our hard materials that way. Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell  to a solar cell  onto a roof  and having it self assemble into a layered structure that harvests light. Here's an interesting one for the IT world  bio silicon. This is a diatom  which is made of silicates. And so silicon  which we make right now    it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips    this is a bio mineralization process that's now being mimicked. This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms. This is from Ernst Haeckel's work. Imagine being able to    and  again  it's a templated process  and it solidifies out of a liquid process    imagine being able to have that sort of structure coming out at room temperature. Imagine being able to make perfect lenses. On the left  this is a brittle star  it's covered with lenses that the people at Lucent Technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever. It's one of the most distortion free lenses we know of. And there's many of them  all over its entire body. What's interesting  again  is that it self assembles. A woman named Joanna Aizenberg  at Lucent  is now learning to do this in a low temperature process to create these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics. That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic. Down at the very base of it  there's fiber optics that work better than ours  actually  to move light  but you can tie them in a knot  they're incredibly flexible. Here's another big idea  CO  as a feedstock. A guy named Geoff Coates  at Cornell  said to himself  you know  plants do not see CO  as the biggest poison of our time. We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose  right  out of CO . He's found a way    he's found a catalyst    and he's found a way to take CO  and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics out of CO     how plant like. Solar transformations  the most exciting one. There are people who are mimicking the energy harvesting device inside of purple bacterium  the people at ASU. Even more interesting  lately  in the last couple of weeks  people have seen that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electrons  and is able to take hydrogen up    basically what's happening in a fuel cell  in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell. In our fuel cells  we do it with platinum  life does it with a very  very common iron. And a team has now just been able to mimic that hydrogen juggling hydrogenase. That's very exciting for fuel cells    to be able to do that without platinum. Power of shape  here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale have tubercles on them. And those little bumps actually increase efficiency in  for instance  the edge of an airplane    increase efficiency by about    percent. Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings  if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing. Color without pigments  this peacock is creating color with shape. Light comes through  it bounces back off the layers  it's called thin film interference. Imagine being able to self assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color. Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface  so that it's self cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does. See that up close picture  That's a ball of water  and those are dirt particles. And that's an up close picture of a lotus leaf. There's a company making a product called Lotusan  which mimics    when the building facade paint dries  it mimics the bumps in a self cleaning leaf  and rainwater cleans the building. Water is going to be our big  grand challenge  quenching thirst. Here are two organisms that pull water. The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog. The one on the right is a pill bug    pulls water out of air  does not drink fresh water. Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta  before it gets into a building  are key technologies. Separation technologies are going to be extremely important. What if we were to say  no more hard rock mining  What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams  small amounts of metals in water  That's what microbes do  they chelate metals out of water. There's a company here in San Francisco called MR  that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters to mine waste streams. Green chemistry is chemistry in water. We do chemistry in organic solvents. This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful  Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book. It's not easy  because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table. And we use all of them  even the toxic ones. To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table  and create miracle materials like that cell  is the task of green chemistry. Timed degradation  packaging that is good until you don't want it to be good anymore  and dissolves on cue. That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here  and the threads holding it to a rock are timed  at exactly two years  they begin to dissolve. Healing  this is a good one. That little guy over there is a tardigrade. There is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients. And the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken  what's called the  cold chain  gets broken. A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade    which dries out completely  and yet stays alive for months and months and months  and is able to regenerate itself. And he found a way to dry out vaccines    encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells    meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated. They can be put in a glove compartment  OK. Learning from organisms. This is a session about water    learning about organisms that can do without water  in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration. I'm not going to get to   . But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing  besides all of these adaptations  is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that's going to take care of their offspring. When they're involved in foreplay  they're thinking about something very  very important    and that's having their genetic material remain         generations from now. And that means finding a way to do what they do without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring. That's the biggest design challenge. Luckily  there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas. Good luck having a conversation with them. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Talk about foreplay  I    we need to get to     but really quickly. Janine Benyus  Oh really  CA  Yeah. Just like  you know  like the    second version of        and   . Because we just    your slides are so gorgeous  and the ideas are so big  I can't stand to let you go down without seeing        and   . JB  OK  put this    OK  I'll just hold this thing. OK  great. OK  so that's the healing one. Sensing and responding  feedback is a huge thing. This is a locust. There can be    million of them in a square kilometer  and yet they don't collide with one another. And yet we have  .  million car collisions a year. Right. There's a person at Newcastle who has figured out that it's a very large neuron. And she's actually figuring out how to make a collision avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust. This is a huge and important one  number   . And that's the growing fertility. That means  you know  net fertility farming. We should be growing fertility. And  oh yes    we get food  too. Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life. And really  that's what other organisms do as well. In ensemble  that's what whole ecosystems do  they create more and more opportunities for life. Our farming has done the opposite. So  farming based on how a prairie builds soil  ranching based on how a native ungulate herd actually increases the health of the range  even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh not only cleans the water  but creates incredibly sparkling productivity. This is the simple design brief. I mean  it looks simple because the system  over  .  billion years  has worked this out. That is  those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places  are not around to tell us about it. That's the twelfth one. Life    and this is the secret trick  this is the magic trick    life creates conditions conducive to life. It builds soil  it cleans air  it cleans water  it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live. And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive. We have to find a way to meet our needs  while making of this place an Eden. CA  Janine  thank you so much. I'm going to give you four specific examples  I'm going to cover at the end about how a company called Silk tripled their sales  how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact  to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect. And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years    a record label I started that had a CD called  Sauce.  Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread  and a guy named Otto Rohwedder. Now  before sliced bread was invented in the     s I wonder what they said  Like the greatest invention since the telegraph or something. But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread  and he focused  like most inventors did  on the patent part and the making part. And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this    that for the first    years after sliced bread was available no one bought it  no one knew about it  it was a complete and total failure. And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread  no one wanted it. That the success of sliced bread  like the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference  is not always about what the patent is like  or what the factory is like    it's about can you get your idea to spread  or not. And I think that the way you're going to get what you want  or cause the change that you want to change  to happen  is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread. And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual  or you're in business  or you're flying hot air balloons. I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do. That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion. That people who can spread ideas  regardless of what those ideas are  win. When I talk about it I usually pick business  because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation  and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score. But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do. At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV. TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way. I call it the  TV industrial complex.  The way the TV industrial complex works  is you buy some ads  interrupt some people  that gets you distribution. You use the distribution you get to sell more products. You take the profit from that to buy more ads. And it goes around and around and around  the same way that the military industrial complex worked a long time ago. That model of  and we heard it yesterday    if we could only get onto the homepage of Google  if we could only figure out how to get promoted there  or grab that person by the throat  and tell them about what we want to do. If we did that then everyone would pay attention  and we would win. Well  this TV industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours. I mean  all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting  in a way they didn't necessarily want  with an ad  over and over again until they bought it. And the thing that's happened is  they canceled the TV industrial complex. That just over the last few years  what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to. This picture is really fuzzy  I apologize  I had a bad cold when I took it. But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child. I go to the deli  I'm sick  I need to buy some medicine. The brand manager for that blue product spent     million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year.     million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and Spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff    all so I could ignore every single message. And I ignored every message because I don't have a pain reliever problem. I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have. And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem  because I don't care. Here's a magazine called  Hydrate.  It's     pages about water. Articles about water  ads about water. Imagine what the world was like    years ago  with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek. Now there are magazines about water. New product from Coke Japan  water salad. Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks  because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not. I couldn't have written this better myself. It came out four days ago    I circled the important parts so you can see them here. They've come out... Arby's is going to spend    million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold  hoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich. Now  I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold  that would get you to get in your car  drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich. Now  this is Copernicus  and he was right  when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.  The world revolves around me.  Me  me  me  me. My favorite person    me. I don't want to get email from anybody  I want to get  memail.  So consumers  and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway  I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something  or people at  you know  the New Yorker who might print your article. Consumers don't care about you at all  they just don't care. Part of the reason is    they've got way more choices than they used to  and way less time. And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time  the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff. And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow  and you keep driving because you've seen cows before. Cows are invisible. Cows are boring. Who's going to stop and pull over and say     Oh  look  a cow.  Nobody. But if the cow was purple    isn't that a great special effect  I could do that again if you want. If the cow was purple  you'd notice it for a while. I mean  if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those  too. The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about  what gets done  what gets changed  what gets purchased  what gets built  is   Is it remarkable   And  remarkable  is a really cool word  because we think it just means  neat   but it also means  worth making a remark about.  And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going. That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a        dollar giant car  big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk. People are paying full price for both  and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common. Every week  the number one best selling DVD in America changes. It's never  The Godfather   it's never  Citizen Kane   it's always some third rate movie with some second rate star. But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out. Because it's new  because it's fresh. People saw it and said  I didn't know that was there  and they noticed it. Two of the big success stories of the last    years in retail    one sells things that are super expensive in a blue box  and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them. The only thing they have in common is that they're different. We're now in the fashion business  no matter what we do for a living  we're in the fashion business. And people in the fashion business know what it's like to be in the fashion business    they're used to it. The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way. How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full page ads  or insisting on meetings with people. But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread  and which ones don't. They sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair. They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought  to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work. This guy  Lionel Poil ne  the most famous baker in the world    he died two and a half months ago  and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend. He lived in Paris. Last year  he sold    million dollars' worth of French bread. Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned  by one baker at a time  in a wood fired oven. And when Lionel started his bakery  the French pooh pooh ed it. They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like  French bread.  It wasn't what they expected. It was neat  it was remarkable  and slowly  it spread from one person to another person until finally  it became the official bread of three star restaurants in Paris. Now he's in London  and he ships by FedEx all around the world. What marketers used to do is make average products for average people. That's what mass marketing is. Smooth out the edges  go for the center  that's the big market. They would ignore the geeks  and God forbid  the laggards. It was all about going for the center. But in a world where the TV industrial complex is broken  I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more. I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you. But market to these people because they care. These are the people who are obsessed with something. And when you talk to them  they'll listen  because they like listening    it's about them. And if you're lucky  they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve  and it'll spread. It'll spread to the entire curve. They have something I call  otaku     it's a great Japanese word. It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say  drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place  because that's what they do  they get obsessed with it. To make a product  to market an idea  to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku  is almost impossible. Instead  you have to find a group that really  desperately cares about what it is you have to say. Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends. There's a hot sauce otaku  but there's no mustard otaku. That's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces  and not so many kinds of mustard. Not because it's hard to make interesting mustard    you could make interesting mustard    but people don't  because no one's obsessed with it  and thus no one tells their friends. Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out. It has a strategy  and what they do is  they enter a city  they talk to the people  with the otaku  and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street. This yoyo right here cost     dollars  but it sleeps for    minutes. Not everybody wants it but they don't care. They want to talk to the people who do  and maybe it'll spread. These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world. It's as loud as a     jet. You can't get in  the car's got bulletproof glass  because it'll blow out the windshield otherwise. But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car  if they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does  they go ahead and they pick this. It's really simple    you sell to the people who are listening  and just maybe  those people tell their friends. So when Steve Jobs talks to        people at his keynote  who are all tuned in from     countries watching his two hour commercial    that's the only thing keeping his company in business    it's that those        people care desperately enough to watch a two hour commercial  and then tell their friends. Pearl Jam     albums released in the last two years. Every one made a profit. How  They only sell them on their website. Those people who buy them have the otaku  and then they tell their friends  and it spreads and it spreads. This hospital crib cost        dollars     times the standard. But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model. Hard Candy nail polish  doesn't appeal to everybody  but to the people who love it  they talk about it like crazy. This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company  making them a fortune. It costs    percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about  because it's remarkable. They didn't just slap a new ad on the product  they changed what it meant to build a paint product. AmIhotornot.com    everyday         people go to this site  run by two volunteers  and I can tell you they are hard graders    They didn't get this way by advertising a lot. They got this way by being remarkable  sometimes a little too remarkable. And this picture frame has a cord going out the back  and you plug it into the wall. My father has this on his desk  and he sees his grandchildren everyday  changing constantly. And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk. And one person at a time  the idea spreads. These are not diamonds  not really. They're made from  cremains.  After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem. Oh  you like my ring  It's my grandmother. Fastest growing business in the whole mortuary industry. But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne    you don't have to be super outrageous to do this. What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them. A couple of quick rules to wrap up. The first one is  Design is free when you get to scale. The people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them. Number two  The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe. Proctor and Gamble knows this  right  The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people. That's risky. The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes  be remarkable. And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do. Very good is boring. Very good is average. It doesn't matter whether you're making a record album  or you're an architect  or you have a tract on sociology. If it's very good  it's not going to work  because no one's going to notice it. So my three stories. Silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section. Sales tripled. Why  Milk  milk  milk  milk  milk    not milk. For the people who were there and looking at that section  it was remarkable. They didn't triple their sales with advertising  they tripled it by doing something remarkable. That is a remarkable piece of art. You don't have to like it  but a    foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable. Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum  he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see. Now  at countless meetings at  you know  the Portland City Council  or who knows where  they said  we need an architect    can we get Frank Gehry  Because he did something that was at the fringes. And my big failure  I came out with an entire    A record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD  this remarkable new format    and I marketed it straight to people with        dollar stereos. People with        dollar stereos don't like new music. So what you need to do is figure out who does care. Who is going to raise their hand and say   I want to hear what you're doing next   and sell something to them. The last example I want to give you. This is a map of Soap Lake  Washington. As you can see  if that's nowhere  it's in the middle of it. But they do have a lake. And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake. They don't anymore. So the founding fathers said   We've got some money to spend. What can we build here   And like most committees  they were going to build something pretty safe. And then an artist came to them    this is a true artist's rendering    he wants to build a    foot tall lava lamp in the center of town. That's a purple cow  that's something worth noticing. I don't know about you  but if they build it  that's where I'm going to go. Thank you very much for your attention. I don't know your name. Audience Member  Howard. Howard. Thom Mayne  Howard  I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard  obviously  and he's going  I hope you're not next. Amazing. Amazing performance. I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that. Let me start some place. I'm interested    I kind of do the same thing  but I don't move my body.  Laughter  And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space  I work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter. And I organize it. And  well  it's also a bit different because an architect versus  let's say  a dance company finally is a negotiation between one's private world  one's conceptual world  the world of ideas  the world of aspirations  of inventions  with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations  the naysayers. Because I have to say  for my whole career  if there's anything that's been consistent  it's been that you can't do it. No matter what I've done  what I've tried to do  everybody says it can't be done. And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas. And to be an architect  somehow you have to negotiate between left and right  and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world  and then make it understood. I can start any number of places  because this process is also    I think    very different from some of the morning sessions  which you had such a kind of very clear  such a lineal idea  like the last one  say  with Howard  that I think the creative process in architecture  the design process  is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine. It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line  not the straight line. And definitely my life has been part of that. I'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things. But basically  what we do is  we try to give coherence to the world. We make physical things  buildings that become a part in an accretional process  they make cities. And those things are the reflection of the processes  and the time that they are made. And what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material. Because  really  all I'm interested in  always  as an architect  is the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right  And it's not based on an a priori notion. I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying   This is what it looks like.  In fact  somebody mentioned    Ewan  maybe it was you in your introduction    about this is what architects    did somebody say it's what business people come to  it's what the corporate world comes to when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line  Huh. Wow. It doesn't work that way for me at all. I have no interest in that whatsoever. Architecture is the beginning of something  because it's    if you're not involved in first principles  if you're not involved in the absolute  the beginning of that generative process  it's cake decoration. And I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators  if anybody's involved in cake decorations    it's not what I'm interested in doing.  Laughter  And so  in the formation of things  in giving it form  in concretizing these things  it starts with some notion of how one organizes. And I've had for    years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear  and to understand the nature of the final result of that  representing the building itself. There's been a continual relationship between inventions  which are private  and reality  which has been important to me. A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen    years ago  which was the modeling of a hippocampus    the territory of the brain that records short term memory    and the documentation of that  the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience. And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer  observing every kilometer a particular object of desire  and then placing that within this. And the notion was that I could make an organization not built on normal coherencies  but built on non sequiturs  built on randomness. And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city  an accretional notion of the city  and that led to various ideas of organization. And then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems. And it's not any single system that makes the work. It's the relationship    it's the dynamics between the systems    which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is    that would otherwise not exist. And those systems could be identified  and they could be grouped together. And of course  today  with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping  etc.  we have the mechanisms to understand and to respond to these systems  and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because that's all we do. We're producing spaces that accommodate human activity. And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that  but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity. And that directly connects to ideas of city making. This is a project that we just finished in Penang for a very  very large city project that came directly out of this process  which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it. And the project    again  enormous  enormous competition    on the Hudson River and in New York that we were asked to do three years ago  which uses these processes. And what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology that uses notions of these multiple forces  that deals with the enormity of the problem  the complexity of the problem  when we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates. Because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate  and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems. And that led us directly to the Olympic Village. I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC. We won the competition    what was it  nine months ago  Again  a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated  very large scale organisms. And then  also  was working with broad strategies. In this case  we only used    of the    acres of land  and the    acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village. And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs  etc. Its position  of course  in the middle of Manhattan    it's on Hunter's Point. And then the broader ideas of city making start having direct influences on architecture  on the elements that make up the broader scheme  the buildings themselves  and start guiding us. Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place. And so I can start this discussion in any number of places  and I've chosen three or four to talk about. And it has also to do with an interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touches. It literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base. There's just no place that it doesn't somehow have a connective tissue to. This is Jim Dine  and it's the absence of presence  etc. It's the clothing  the skin  without the presence of the character. It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work  and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface  and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very  kind of complex space. And the idea was the relationship of the space  which was made up of the fold of the image  and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration  and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space  which were in dialog. And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things  and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces  and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations. And this was the first prototype in Korea  as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope  and then the same characteristic of the fabric. It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous  and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is. And that turned right away into another project. This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles. And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated. Again  it's a very  very simple notion. If you look at most buildings  what you look at is the building  the facade  and it is the building. And all of a sudden we're kind of moving away  and we're separating the skin from the body  and that's going to lead to broader performance criteria  which I'm going to talk about in a minute. And you're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body. And then  again  the building itself  middle of Los Angeles  right across from City Hall. And as it moves  it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up. It's part of a sign system  which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles    the two dimension  three dimension signing  etc. And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself. It's transparent  and it allows you to understand  I think  what is always the most interesting thing in any building  which is the actual constructional processes that make it. And it's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work  which is not occupied  because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when it's separated from function  and this is an area that allows for that. And then the skin starts transforming into other materials. We're using light as a building material in this case. We're working with Keith Sonnier in New York  and we're making this large outside room  which is possible in Los Angeles  and which is very much reflective of the urban  the contemporary urban environments that you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City or Sao Paulo  etc.  that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time. And that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles. And  again  all of it promoting transparency. And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium  that light becomes literally a building material. Well  that immediately turned into something much broader  and as a scope. And again  we're looking at an early sketch where I'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower. This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction. And now it turned into something much  much broader as a problem  and it has to do with performance. This will be the first building in the United States that took    well  I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid. I wanted a pure thing  and I can't get it. It's a wrong attitude  actually  because the hybrid is probably more interesting. But we took the air conditioning out of the tower. There's some air conditioning left in the base  but the skin now moves on hydraulics. It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind. It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning. Huge  huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta.    of these    it's just under a million square feet        and some thousand square feet       of these would power Sausalito    the delta on this. And so now what we're looking at  as the projects get larger in scale  as they interface with broader problems  that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance. Well  I could also start here. We could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground. Well  our research    my generation for sure  people who were going to school in the late '  s    made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture  looking at architecture within its own territory  and we were much more affected by film  by what was going on in the art world  etc. This is  of course  Michael Heizer. And when I saw this  first an image and then visited  it completely changed the way I thought after that point. And I understood that building really could be the augmentation of the Earth's surface  and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense. And then    well  he was probably looking at this    this is Nazca  this is     years ago    the most amazing four kilometer land sculptures. They're just totally incredible. And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw  how we work. This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona    well  whatever it is  a model  a conceptual  kind of idea. And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable. So it puts         square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth. There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work. And there it is  again  as it's starting to get resolved tectonically  and then there's the school. And  of course  we're interested in participating with education. I have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates X  Y and Z function. What I'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people. It demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it's a system that's developed not sculpturally. It's an idea that started from my first discussion. It has to do with a broad  consistent logic  and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building. And there's an overt    at least  there's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem  as one would understand that. And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles that uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea. Then  again  we're doing the headquarters for NOAA    National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency    outside of Washington in Maryland. And this is how they see the world. They have    satellites zipping around at plus or minus     miles  and the site's in red. And what we really want to do    well  the architects  if there are architects out there  this is the Laugier Hut  this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long    and what we wanted to do is really build this  because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world  and we wanted them to look down at their satellite  how they see their own site  that eight acre site  and we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green. There's actually three baseball fields on it right now  and they're going to stay there. We put one piece directly north south  and it holds the dishes at the ears  right  And then right below that the processing  and the mission lift  and the mission control room  and all the other spaces are underground. And what you look at is an aircraft carrier that's performance driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes. And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion  broken up by a series of courts  and it's five acres of uninterrupted  horizontal space for their administrative offices. And then that  in turn  propelled us to look at larger scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue. The new capital competition for Berlin  four years ago. And again we just finished the ECB    actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project  where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park  which is parallel to the river  and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric    the social  cultural and the landscape  recreational fabric of the city. And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing  but something that's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time. And a project that was realized in Austria  the Hooper Bank  which again used this idea of connecting typology  the traditional buildings  and morphology  or the relationship of the development of land as an idea  into a complex  which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting  this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it  and other parts are much more energetic and intense. And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together  and then where part of it is in the ground  part of it is oppositional lifts. One enters the building as it lifts off the ground  and it becomes part of the idea. And then the skin    the edges of this    all promote the dynamic  the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts  geologic shifts. Right  And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior  and those interiors  again  are promoting transparency for the workplace  which has been a continual interest of ours. And then  again  in a more  kind of traditional setting  this is a graduate student housing in Toronto  and it's very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city. The main idea was the gateway  where it breaks the site  and the building occupies both the public space and the private space. And it's that territory of    it's this thing. I visited the site many times  and everybody  kind of    you can see this from two kilometers away  it's an exact center of the street  and the whole notion is to engage the public  to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city. And finally  one of the most interesting projects    it's a courthouse. And what I want to talk about    this is the Supreme Court  of course    and  well  I'm dealing with Michael Hogan  the Chief Justice of Oregon. You could not proceed without making this negotiation between one's own values and the relationship of the character you're working with and how he understands the court  because I'm showing him  of course  Corbusier at Savoy  which is       which is the beginning of modern architecture. Well  then we get to this image. And this is where the project started. Because I'm going  I'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here. And really what we're talking about is constructing reality. And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone. Nature in the   th century sense  alright  Nature is only a cultural edifice today  right  We construct it and we construct those ideas. And then of course  this one  our governor at the moment. And we spent some time with Conan  believe it or not  and then that led us to  kind of  the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic  architectural. And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work  and the dynamics of that  and what other sources of the work is. And it led us to the project  the courthouse  which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse. You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court. Here's a piano nobile  which is a device used in the Renaissance. The courts were made of that. The skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated stonework  but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution  which were part of the little process  all set on a plinth that defined it from the community. Thank you so much. I was asked to come here and speak about creation. And I only have    minutes  and I see they're counting already. And I can    in    minutes  I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation  which I call  creativity.  Creativity is how we cope with creation. While creation sometimes seems a bit un graspable  or even pointless  creativity is always meaningful. See  for instance  in this picture. You know  creation is what put that dog in that picture  and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters. When you think about    you know  creativity has a lot to do with causality too. You know  when I was a teenager  I was a creator. I just did things. Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was  and tried to maintain that persona    I became creative. It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition  that I could track exactly    looks like all the craziest things that I had done  all my drinking  all my parties    they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually I'm talking to you at this moment. Though it's actually true  you know  the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil. If I was born in Monterey  probably would be in Brazil. You know  I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '  s under a climate of political distress  and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way    in a sort of a semiotic black market. You couldn't really say what you wanted to say  you had to invent ways of doing it. You didn't trust information very much. That led me to another step of why I'm here today  is because I really liked media of all kinds. I was a media junkie  and eventually got involved with advertising. My first job in Brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards  and based on speed  angle of approach and actually blocks of text. It was very    actually  it was a very good study  and got me a job in an ad agency. And they also decided that I had to    to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it. And another point    why I'm here    is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy  I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life  picked the thing    didn't have any friends. On my way out  I had to break a fight apart. Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles. They were in tuxedos  and fighting. It was very ugly. And also    advertising people do that all the time     Laughter     and I    well  what happened is when I went back  it was on the way back to my car  the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun    I don't know why he had a gun    and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor. The first person was wearing a black tie  a tuxedo. It was me. Luckily  it wasn't fatal  as you can all see. And  even more luckily  the guy said that he was sorry and I bribed him for compensation money  otherwise I press charges. And that's how    with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in       and that's very    the basic reason I'm talking to you here today  because I got shot.  Laughter   Applause  Well  when I started working with my own work  I decided that I shouldn't do images. You know  I became    I took this very iconoclastic approach. Because when I decided to go into advertising  I wanted to do    I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice  for whiskey commercials  that's what I really wanted to do.  Laughter  But I    they didn't let me do it  so I just    you know  they would only let me do other things. But I wasn't into selling whiskey  I was into selling ice. The first works were actually objects. It was kind of a mixture of found object  product design and advertising. And I called them relics. They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in     . This is the clown skull. Is a remnant of a race of    a very evolved race of entertainers. They lived in Brazil  long time ago.  Laughter  This is the Ashanti joystick. Unfortunately  it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform. A Playstation II is in the works  maybe for the next TED I'll bring it. The rocking podium.  Laughter  This is the pre Columbian coffeemaker.  Laughter  Actually  the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks  that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee  the coffee was actually pre Columbian. The Bonsai table. The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume  for travel purposes. And the half tombstone  for people who are not dead yet. I wanted to take that into the realm of images  and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts. So I decided to do work with clouds. Because clouds can mean anything you want. But now I wanted to work in a very low tech way  so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton  a cloud and Durer's praying hands    although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands. But I was still  you know    this is a kitty cloud. They're called  Equivalents   after Alfred Stieglitz's work.  The Snail.  But I was still working with sculpture  and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.  The Teapot.  I had a chance to go to Florence  in    I think it was '    and I saw Ghiberti's  Door of Paradise.  And he did something that was very tricky. He put together two different media from different periods of time. First  he got an age old way of making it  which was relief  and he worked this with three point perspective  which was brand new technology at the time. And it's totally overkill. And your eye doesn't know which level to read. And you become trapped into this kind of representation. So I decided to make these very simple renderings  that at first they are taken as a line drawing    you know  something that's very    and then I did it with wire. The idea was to    because everybody overlooks white    like pencil drawings  you know  And they would look at it     Ah  it's a pencil drawing.  Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time. It had a physicality  and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way  towards the image. So this is  Monkey with Leica.   Relaxation.   Fiat Lux.  And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings. And I wanted to deal with other subjects. I started taking that into the realm of landscape  which is something that's almost a picture of nothing. I made these pictures called  Pictures of Thread   and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture. These always end up being a photograph at the end  or more like an etching in this case. So this is a lighthouse. This is        Yards   after Corot.        Yards   after Gerhard Richter. And I don't know how many yards  after John Constable. Departing from the lines  I decided to tackle the idea of points  like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves. I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts  and I did work and play with them. I got some photographs from them. Upon my arrival in New York  I decided    they were children of sugar plantation workers. And by manipulating sugar over a black paper  I made portraits of them. These are     Applause     Thank you. This is  Valentina  the Fastest.  It was just the name of the child  with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.  Valicia.   Jacynthe.  But another layer of representation was still introduced. Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures  I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject    something that would interfere with the themes  so chocolate is very good  because it has    it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance. And so I decided to make these pictures  and they were very large  so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them. So they're called  Pictures of Chocolate.  Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject. And Jackson Pollock also. Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting  because  you know  you go to that    you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily  like a face  goes into becoming just a texture.  Paparazzi.  I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection. And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity. And you render this with the most non specific material  which is dust itself. Like  you know  you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor. They do a DNA scan of this  they will come up with a great mailing list. This is Richard Serra. I bought a computer  and  they  told me it had millions of colors in it. You know an artist's first response to this is  who counted it  You know  And I realized that I never worked with color  because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors. But once they're applied to numeric structure  then you can feel more comfortable. So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches. They end up being very large pictures  and I photographed with a very large camera    an  x   camera. So you can see the surface of every single swatch    like in this picture of Chuck Close. And you have to walk very far to be able to see it. Also  the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts    and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today  which is the bit map. I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's  Haystacks.  This is something I used to do as a joke    you know  make    the same like    Robert Smithson's  Spiral Jetty     and then leaving traces  as if it was done on a tabletop. I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake. But then  just doing the models  I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original. And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself. I opt for very simple line drawings    kind of stupid looking. And at the same time  I was doing these very large constructions  being     meters away. Now I would do very small ones  which would be like    but under the same light  and I would show them together  so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking. I wasn't interested in the very large things  or in the small things. I was more interested in the things in between  you know  because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there. This is like you see    the size of a person over there. This is a pipe. A hanger. And this is another thing that I did    you know working    everybody loves to watch somebody draw  but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in    a lot of people at the same time  to evidence a single drawing. And I love this work  because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months. And it was quite wonderful  because I had an interest    an early interest    in theater  that's justified on this thing. In theater  you have the character and the actor in the same place  trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience. And in this  you'd have like a    something that looks like a cloud  and it is a cloud at the same time. So they're like perfect actors. My interest in acting  especially bad acting  goes a long way. Actually  I once paid like    dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of  King Lear   and I felt really robbed  because by the time the actor started being King Lear  he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see. On the other hand  you know  I paid like three dollars  I think    and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of  Othello  by an amateur group. And it was quite fascinating  because you know the guy    his name was Joey Grimaldi    he impersonated the Moorish general    you know  for the first three minutes he was really that general  and then he went back into plumber  he worked as a plumber  so    plumber  general  plumber  general    so for three dollars  I saw two tragedies for the price of one. See  I think it's not really about impression  making people fall for a really perfect illusion  as much as it is to make    I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion. Because it's not about fooling somebody  it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief  how much you want to be fooled. That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that. Well  I think that's it. My time is nearly up. Thank you very much. Well  I thought there would be a podium  so I'm a bit scared. Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA. And since  you know  I follow his orders  I'll do it. But it slightly bores me. And  you know  I wrote a book. So I'll say something       I'll say a little about  you know  how the discovery was made  and why Francis and I found it. And then  I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now. In back of me is a picture of me when I was   . I was at the University of Chicago  in my third year  and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two years of high school. So you    it was fun to get away from high school     Laughter     because I was very small  and I was no good in sports  or anything like that. But I should say that my background    my father was  you know  raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican  but after one year of college  he became an atheist and a Democrat. And my mother was Irish Catholic  and    but she didn't take religion too seriously. And by the age of     I was no longer going to Sunday Mass  and going on birdwatching walks with my father. So early on  I heard of Charles Darwin. I guess  you know  he was the big hero. And  you know  you understand life as it now exists through evolution. And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major  and thought I would end up  you know  if I was bright enough  maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology. Then  in the Chicago paper  there was a review of a book called  What is Life   by the great physicist  Schrodinger. And that  of course  had been a question I wanted to know. You know  Darwin explained life after it got started  but what was the essence of life  And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes  and it had to be present on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before. You know chromosomes  but this was a molecule  and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form. And there was the big question of  how did you copy the information  So that was the book. And so  from that moment on  I wanted to be a geneticist    understand the gene and  through that  understand life. So I had  you know  a hero at a distance. It wasn't a baseball player  it was Linus Pauling. And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down. So I went to Indiana  which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics  and besides  they had a really good basketball team.  Laughter  So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana. And it was at Indiana I got the impression that  you know  the gene was likely to be DNA. And so when I got my Ph.D.  I should go and search for DNA. So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought  well  maybe I could become a biochemist  but I discovered biochemistry was very boring. It wasn't going anywhere toward  you know  saying what the gene was  it was just nuclear science. And oh  that's the book  little book. You can read it in about two hours. And    but then I went to a meeting in Italy. And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program  and he talked about DNA. And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist  and after the war he wanted to do biophysics  and he picked DNA because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes. Most people believed it was proteins. But Wilkins  you know  thought DNA was the best bet  and he showed this x ray photograph. Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure  even though it owed it to probably different molecules carrying different sets of instructions. So there was something universal about the DNA molecule. So I wanted to work with him  but he didn't want a former birdwatcher  and I ended up in Cambridge  England. So I went to Cambridge  because it was really the best place in the world then for x ray crystallography. And x ray crystallography is now a subject in  you know  chemistry departments. I mean  in those days it was the domain of the physicists. So the best place for x ray crystallography was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge. And there I met Francis Crick. I went there without knowing him. He was   . I was   . And within a day  we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA. Not solve it like  you know  in rigorous fashion  but build a model  an electro model  using some coordinates of  you know  length  all that sort of stuff from x ray photographs. But just ask what the molecule    how should it fold up  And the reason for doing so  at the center of this photograph  is Linus Pauling. About six months before  he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so  he banished the man out on the right  Sir Lawrence Bragg  who was the Cavendish professor. This is a photograph several years later  when Bragg had cause to smile. He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there  because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix  and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists. And certainly  neither Crick or I were chemists  so we tried to build a model. And he knew  Francis knew Wilkins. So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix. X ray diagram  he thought was comparable with the helix. So we built a three stranded model. The people from London came up. Wilkins and this collaborator  or possible collaborator  Rosalind Franklin  came up and sort of laughed at our model. They said it was lousy  and it was. So we were told to build no more models  we were incompetent. And so we didn't build any models  and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins. And basically  I did nothing. And    except read. You know  basically  reading is a good thing  you get facts. And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA. If DNA is that important  Linus will know it. He'll build a model  and then we're going to be scooped. And  in fact  he'd written the people in London  Could he see their x ray photograph  And they had the wisdom to say  no.  So he didn't have it. But there was ones in the literature. Actually  Linus didn't look at them that carefully. But about  oh     months after I got to Cambridge  a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son  who was in Cambridge  that his father was now working on DNA. And so  one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling  and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts. And boy  I was scared because I thought  you know  we may be scooped. I have nothing to do  no qualifications for anything. And so there was the paper  and he proposed a three stranded structure. And I read it  and it was just    it was crap. So this was  you know  unexpected from the world's       and so  it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups. Well  if the peak pH that cells have is around seven  those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist. We rushed over to the chemistry department and said   Could Pauling be right   And Alex Hust said   No.  So we were happy. And  you know  we were still in the game  but we were frightened that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong. And so Bragg said   Build models.  And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript    I should say I took the manuscript to London  and showed the people. Well  I said  Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models. But Wilkins said  no.  Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months  and after she left he would start building models. And so I came back with that news to Cambridge  and Bragg said   Build models.  Well  of course  I wanted to build models. And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really  you know  in one sense she was a chemist  but really she would have been trained    she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry. She was a crystallographer. And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models was  she wasn't a chemist  whereas Pauling was a chemist. And so Crick and I  you know  started building models  and I'd learned a little chemistry  but not enough. Well  we got the answer on the   th February '  . And it was because of a rule  which  to me  is a very good rule  Never be the brightest person in a room  and we weren't. We weren't the best chemists in the room. I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done  and Jerry Donohue    he was a chemist    he said  it's wrong. You've got    the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place. I just put them down like they were in the books. He said they were wrong. So the next day  you know  after I thought   Well  he might be right.  So I changed the locations  and then we found the base pairing  and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions. And we knew we were right. So it was a pretty  you know  it all happened in about two hours. From nothing to thing. And we knew it was big because  you know  if you just put A next to T and G next to C  you have a copying mechanism. So we saw how genetic information is carried. It's the order of the four bases. So in a sense  it is a sort of digital type information. And you copy it by going from strand separating. So  you know  if it didn't work this way  you might as well believe it  because you didn't have any other scheme. But that's not the way most scientists think. Most scientists are really rather dull. They said  we won't think about it until we know it's right. But  you know  we thought  well  it's at least    percent right or    percent right. So think about it. The next five years  there were essentially something like five references to our work in  Nature     none. And so we were left by ourselves  and trying to do the last part of the trio  how do you    what does this genetic information do  It was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule  and then how do you go from RNA to protein  For about three years we just    I tried to solve the structure of RNA. It didn't yield. It didn't give good x ray photographs. I was decidedly unhappy  a girl didn't marry me. It was really  you know  sort of a shitty time. So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl  so I'm still looking happy. But there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward  we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club. George Gamow  also a great physicist  he designed the tie. He was one of the members. The question was  How do you go from a four letter code to the    letter code of proteins  Feynman was a member  and Teller  and friends of Gamow. But that's the only    no  we were only photographed twice. And on both occasions  you know  one of us was missing the tie. There's Francis up on the upper right  and Alex Rich    the M.D. turned crystallographer    is next to me. This was taken in Cambridge in September of     . And I'm smiling  sort of forced  I think  because the girl I had  boy  she was gone. And so I didn't really get happy until       because then we found out  basically  you know  that there are three forms of RNA. And we knew  basically  DNA provides the information for RNA. RNA provides the information for protein. And that let Marshall Nirenberg  you know  take RNA    synthetic RNA    put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine  polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code  and it was all over by     . So there  that's what Chris wanted me to do  it was    so what happened since then  Well  at that time    I should go back. When we found the structure of DNA  I gave my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist  Leo Szilard  he looked at me and said   Are you going to patent this   And    but he knew patent law  and that we couldn't patent it  because you couldn't. No use for it. And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule  and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until          years later  when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA  and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money. At least they patented something which  you know  could do useful things. And then  they learned how to read the letters for the code. And  boom  we've  you know  had a biotech industry. And  but we were still a long ways from  you know  answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood  which is  How do you nature nurture  And so I'll go on. I'm already out of time  but this is Michael Wigler  a very  very clever mathematician turned physicist. And he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample DNA and  eventually  a million spots along it. There's a chip there  a conventional one. Then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called NimbleGen  which is way ahead of Affymetrix. And we use their technique. And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer. And you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions. So the DNA is really badly mucked up  whereas if you have a chance of surviving  the DNA isn't so mucked up. So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call  DNA biopsies.  Before you get treated for cancer  you should really look at this technique  and get a feeling of the face of the enemy. It's not a    it's only a partial look  but it's a    I think it's going to be very  very useful. So  we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it  no government money. And now I have a sort of vested interest  I want to do it for prostate cancer. So  you know  you aren't treated if it's not dangerous. But Wigler  besides looking at cancer cells  looked at normal cells  and made a really sort of surprising observation. Which is  all of us have about    places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one. So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well  if we're around here  you know  these little losses or gains might not be too bad. But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene  maybe we'll feel sick. So the first disease he looked at is autism. And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it. Looking at an individual is about       dollars. And the parent of a child with Asperger's disease  the high intelligence autism  had sent his thing to a conventional company  they didn't do it. Couldn't do it by conventional genetics  but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism. And you can see here  there are a lot of them. So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA. I mean  big piece at the molecular level. We saw one autistic kid  about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes. We haven't yet looked at the parents  but the parents probably don't have that loss  or they wouldn't be parents. Now  so  our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars. I think it will cost at least    to    before you'd be in a position to help parents who've had an autistic child  or think they may have an autistic child  and can we spot the difference  So this same technique should probably look at all. It's a wonderful way to find genes. And so  I'll conclude by saying we've looked at    people with schizophrenia. And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture. But as you can see  there's seven out of    had a change which was very high. And yet  in the controls there were three. So what's the meaning of the controls  Were they crazy also  and we didn't know it  Or  you know  were they normal  I would guess they're normal. And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure  and whether this is one that predisposes    and then there's only a sub segment of the population that's capable of being schizophrenic. Now  we don't have really any evidence of it  but I think  to give you a hypothesis  the best guess is that if you're left handed  you're prone to schizophrenia.    percent of schizophrenic people are left handed  and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics  which means    percent of the people are genetically left handed  but only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say. Now  some people who think they're right handed are genetically left handed. OK. I'm just saying that  if you think  oh  I don't carry a left handed gene so therefore my  you know  children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK  So it's  to me  an extraordinarily exciting time. We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar  there's a relationship. And if I had enough money  we'd find them all this year. I thank you. Nature's my muse and it's been my passion. As a photographer for National Geographic  I've portrayed it for many. But five years ago  I went on a personal journey. I wanted to visualize the story of life. It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted  and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out. But there were also revelations. And one of those I'd like to share with you today. I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia  hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago  back before the sky turned blue. There's stromatolites down there    the first living things to capture photosynthesis    and it's the only place they still occur today. Going down there was like entering a time capsule  and I came out with a different sense of myself in time. The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today. Stromatolites are the heroes in my story. I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time. It's a story about you and me  nature and science. And with that said  I'd like to invite you for a short  brief journey of life through time. Our journey starts in space  where matter condenses into spheres over time ... solidifying into surface  molded by fire. The fire gave way  Earth emerged    but this was an alien planet. The moon was closer  things were different. Heat from within made geysers erupt    that is how the oceans were born. Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth. Water is the key to life  but in frozen form  it is a latent force. And when it vanishes  Earth becomes Mars. But this planet is different    it's roiling inside. And where that energy touches water  something new emerges  life. It arises around cracks in the Earth. Mud and minerals become substrate  there are bacteria. Learn to multiply  thickening in places ... Growing living structures under an alien sky ... Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen. And they changed the atmosphere. A breath that's fossilized now as iron. Meteorites delivered chemistry  and perhaps membranes  too. Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate. These are diatoms  single celled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon ... circuit boards of the future. Shallow seas nurtured life early on  and that's where it morphed into more complex forms. It grew as light and oxygen increased. Life hardened and became defensive. It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites. Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs  among the first to leave the sea. They still do what they've done for ages  their enemies long gone. Scorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails. Fish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts. Lichens arose as a co op. Fungi married algae ... clinging to rock  and eating it too ... transforming barren land. True land plants arose  leafless at first. Once they learn how to stay upright  they grew in size and shape. The fundamental forms of ferns followed  to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds. Life flourished in swamps. On land  life turned a corner. Jaws formed first  teeth came later. Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era. It took time for life to break away from water  and it still beckons all the time. Life turned hard so it could venture inland. And the dragons that arose are still among us today. Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar  and the center of Brazil  where plants called  cycads  remain rock hard. Forests arose and nurtured things with wings. One early form left an imprint  like it died only yesterday. And others fly today like echoes of the past. In birds  life gained new mobility. Flamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway. Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants. Water lilies were among the first. Plants began to diversify and grew  turning into trees. In Australia  a lily turned into a grass tree  and in Hawaii  a daisy became a silver sword. In Africa  Gondwana molded Proteas. But when that ancient continent broke up  life got lusher. Tropical rainforests arose  sparking new layers of interdependence. Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged  genitalia shaped to lure insects ... a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth. Co evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever. When birds can't fly  they become vulnerable. Kiwis are  and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica. Extinction can come slowly  but sometimes it arrives fast. An asteroid hits  and the world went down in flames. But there were witnesses  survivors in the dark. When the skies cleared  a new world was born. A world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews  came  tenrecs  accustomed to the dark. New forms became bats. Civets. New predators  hyenas  getting faster and faster still. Grasslands created opportunities. Herd safety came with sharpened senses. Growing big was another answer  but size always comes at a price. Some mammals turned back to water. Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek. And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds. There are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz  a horse runs in Asia  and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil. Primates emerge from jungles  as tarsiers first  becoming lemurs not much later. Learning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open. And forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle. So who are we  Brothers of masculine chimps  sisters of feminine bonobos  We are all of them  and more. We're molded by the same life force. The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth. And our brains    our celebrated brains    reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh. Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element. And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin. And where it doesn't  as in Greenland in winter  Mars is still not very far. But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again. And where water is liquid  it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll    and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference    it powers everything. The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae  and their waste is our breath  and vice versa. This Earth is alive  and it's made its own membrane. We call it  atmosphere.  This is the icon of our journey. And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Actually  that's  hello  in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us. One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants    the  Big  being the organization  the system  the country    and what the  Small  wants    the individual  the person. And how do you bring those two things together  Charlie Ledbetter  yesterday  I thought  talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers  to bring people into the process of creating things. And that's what I want to talk about today. So  bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big  I think  is something that we believe in    something I believe in  and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo. I call this first chapter    for the Brits in the room    the  Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious.  Often  the good ideas are so staring at you right in the face that you kind of miss them. And I think  a lot of times  what we do is just  sort of  hold the mirror up to our clients  and sort of go   Duh  You know  look what's really going on.  And rather than talk about it in the theory  I think I'm just going to show you an example. We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was. And I think they were expecting    they'd worked with lots of consultants before    I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this  that and the other  and all kinds of mappy stuff. Or even worse  some kind of ghastly death by Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of  you know  God knows  whatever. The first thing we actually shared with them was this. I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve. This is    seconds into the film. This is a minute   .     . I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.     .     .     . We showed them the whole cut  and they were all completely  what is this  And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day  all you do is look at the roof  and it's a really shitty experience. And just putting yourself in the position of the patient    this is Christian  who works with us at Ideo. He just lay in the hospital bed  and  kind of  stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time. That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital. And they were sort  you know  blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious. Oh  my goodness. So  looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out    as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in    was  for these guys  quite a revelation. And so  that was a really catalytic thing for them. So they snapped into action. They said  OK  it's not about systemic change. It's not about huge  ridiculous things that we need to do. It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference. So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact. The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band Aided it here  onto a gurney  a hospital trolley  so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor  you could actually have a conversation with them. You could  kind of  see them in your rear view mirror  so it created a tiny human interaction. Very small example of something that they could do. Interestingly  the nurses themselves  sort of  snapped into action    said  OK  we embrace this. What can we do  The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling. Which I thought was really    I showed this to my mother recently. I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator. It's what I do for a living  sort of Laurence Llewelyn Bowen. Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real  sort of  hard core designers  but nonetheless  a fabulous empathic solution for people. Things that they started doing themselves    like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified   This is my room. This is my personal space     was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem. So you went from public space to private space. And another idea  again  that came from one of the nurses    which I love    was they took traditional  sort of  corporate white boards  then they put them on one wall of the patient's room  and they put this sticker there. So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room  which was lovely. So  tiny  tiny  tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact. I thought that was a really  really nice example. So this is not particularly a new idea  kind of  seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution. It's a history of invention based around this. I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right. Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter    came down on a Saturday morning  saw her daughter watching the test card  waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street. Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship. And he invented the shipping container. George de Mestral    this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock    was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs  sort of little prickly things  and from that came Velcro. And finally  for the Brits  Percy Shaw    this is a big British invention    saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road  when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye. So there's a whole series of just using your eyes  seeing things for the first time  seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities. Second one  without sounding overly Zen  and this is a quote from the Buddha   Finding yourself in the margins  looking to the edges of things  is often a really interesting place to start.  Blinkered vision tends to produce  I think  blinkered solutions. So  looking wide  using your peripheral vision  is a really interesting place to look for opportunity. Again  another medical example here. We were asked by a device producer    we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo. We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo    they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics. This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital. They'll ask the nurses to input data. And they had this vision of the nurse  kind of  clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly  sort of  gadget lustish. When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place    and I'll explain this in a second    it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing. When you're having a four inch needle inserted into your spine    which was the procedure that this device's data was about  it was for pain management    you're shit scared  you're freaking out. And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did  was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture    which made the fabulous two handed data input completely impossible. So  the thing that we designed  much less sexy but much more human and practical  was this. So  it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination  but it has a thumb scroll so you can do everything with one hand. So  again  going back to this    the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product. And I think that's really  really important. So  again  this idea of workarounds. We use this phrase  workarounds  a lot  sort of  looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here. This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life    and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential    is something that we look at a lot. We wrote a book recently  I think you might have received it  called  Thoughtless Acts   It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do  which have huge intention and huge opportunity. Why do we all follow the line in the street  This is a picture in a Japanese subway. People consciously follow things even though  why  we don't know. Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence  Because we kind of have to    we're just compelled to. We don't know why  but we do. Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle  Again  we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions. And we're always saying to our clients   You should look at this stuff. This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital.  This is people designing their own experiences. You can draw from this. We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street  that it's okay to use it  so we park our shopping cart there. It's there for our use  on some level. So  again  we sort of co opt our environment to do all these different things. We co opt other experiences    we take one item and transfer it to another. And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me   Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to.  But  of course  we all do. We all follow each other every day. So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something  that's permission for them to do the same thing. And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time. I mean  shopping bag equals  parking meter out of order.  And we all  kind of  know how to read these signals now. We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing. Third section is this idea of not knowing  of consciously putting yourself backwards. I talk about unthinking situations all the time. Sort of having beginner's mind  scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh. A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA  and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children. This is the Billy bookcase    it's IKEA's biggest selling product. Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe  if you're me  because they're impossible to assemble. But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children  The reality is when you actually watch children  children don't think about things like storage in linear terms. Children assume permission in a very different way. Children live on things. They live under things. They live around things  and so their spatial awareness relationship  and their thinking around storage is totally different. So the first thing you have to do    this is Graham  the designer    is  sort of  put yourself in their shoes. And so  here he is sitting under the table. So  what came out of this  This is the storage system that he designed. So what is this  I hear you all ask. No  I don't. It's this  and I think this is a particularly lovely solution. So  you know  it's a totally different way of looking at the situation. It's a completely empathic solution    apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it. But a really nice way of re framing the ordinary  and I think that's one of the things. And putting yourself in the position of the person  and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel  And then use that information to fuel solutions  And I think that's what this is very much about. Last section  green armband. We've all got them. It's about this really. I mean  it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win. Again  that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is  Where do we start  How do we start  What do we do to start  So  again  we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC  in Kenya. They're now called KickStart. And  again  as designers  we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form. And that was completely irrelevant. When you put yourself in the position of these people  things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle  become much more relevant than the form of it. The way it's produced  it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials. So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user. We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world. So what seems like a very clunky product is  in fact  incredibly useful. It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster    you pump up and down on it. Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it. It's turning these guys    again  one of the themes    it's turning them into entrepreneurs. These guys are using this very successfully. And for us  it's been great because it's won loads of design awards. So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company  the needs of the individuals in the company  to feel good about a product we were actually designing  and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for. There it is  pumping water from    feet. So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning. We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start  no pun intended  their next project. Because  again  I think  sort of  putting our money where our mouth is  here. We feel that this is an important gesture. So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big. I hope you'll all wear them. So that's it. Thank you. I want to talk today about    I've been asked to take the long view  and I'm going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view. Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers  which is encouraging. It seems that there's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important. The first is    death is a big problem. If you look at the statistics  the odds are not very favorable to us. So far  most people who have lived have also died. Roughly    percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now. So the annual death rate adds up to            sorry  the daily death rate            people per day  which is a huge number by any standard. The annual death rate  then  becomes    million. If we just look at the single  biggest cause of death    aging    it accounts for roughly two thirds of all human people who die. That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada. Sometimes  we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big. Can't see it because it's too big. I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem. Once you think about it  you see this is not statistical points  these are    let's see  how far have I talked  I've talked for three minutes. So that would be  roughly      people have died since I've begun speaking. People like    it's roughly the population in this room has just died. Now  the human cost of that is obvious  once you start to think about it    the suffering  the loss    it's also  economically  enormously wasteful. I just look at the information  and knowledge  and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general  and aging  in particular. Suppose we approximated one person with one book  Now  of course  this is an underestimation. A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book. But let's suppose we did this.    million people die of natural causes each year corresponds  then  to    million volumes destroyed. Library of Congress holds    million volumes. We are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria. It's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember  even today. But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress    burnt down  forever lost    each year. So that's the first big problem. And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey  and other people like him  to try to do something about this as soon as possible. Existential risk    the second big problem. Existential risk is a threat to human survival  or to the long term potential of our species. Now  why do I say that this is a big problem  Well  let's first look at the probability    and this is very  very difficult to estimate    but there have been only four studies on this in recent years  which is surprising. You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big  but it's a very neglected area. But there have been four studies    one by John Lesley  wrote a book on this. He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century     percent. Similarly  the Astronomer Royal  whom we heard speak yesterday  also has a    percent probability estimate. Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate  but says the probability is significant that it will fail. I wrote a long paper on this. I said assigning a less than    percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have. Now  the exact figures here  we should take with a big grain of salt  but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial. Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees. Now  if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point    not very much    so that's equivalent to    million lives saved  if we just count the currently living people  the current generation. Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to    million. So that's a large number. If we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up  then the figure becomes astronomical. If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe    the Virgo supercluster    maybe it will take us     million years to get there  but if we go extinct we never will. Then  even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number       to the power of   . So if you take into account future generations as much as our own  every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant. The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve. And even if you just look at the current people  and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct  it should still have a high priority. Now  let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem  because it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp. Think about some time in your life    some people might never have experienced it    but some people  there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic. It might have been at the moment of some great  creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage. Or when you understood something you had never done before. Or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love. Or an aesthetic experience    a sunset or a great piece of art. Every once in a while we have these moments  and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best. And you wonder  why can't it be like that all the time  You just want to cling onto this. And then  of course  it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades. And it's really difficult to recall  in a normal frame of mind  just how good life can be at its best. Or how bad it can be at its worst. The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be. I think that's a big  big problem. It's easy to say what we don't want. Here are a number of things that we don't want    illness  involuntary death  unnecessary suffering  cruelty  stunted growth  memory loss  ignorance  absence of creativity. Suppose we fixed these things    we did something about all of these. We were very successful. We got rid of all of these things. We might end up with something like this  which is    I mean  it's a heck of a lot better than that. But is this really the best we can dream of  Is this the best we can do  Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards  And if we think about this  I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things  not just by eliminating negatives  but adding positives. On my wish list  at least  would be  much longer  healthier lives  greater subjective well being  enhanced cognitive capacities  more knowledge and understanding  unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits  better relationships  an unbounded potential for spiritual  moral and intellectual development. If we want to achieve this  what  in the world  would have to change  And this is the answer    we would have to change. Not just the world around us  but we  ourselves. Not just the way we think about the world  but the way we are    our very biology. Human nature would have to change. Now  when we think about changing human nature  the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies    growth hormone therapy  cosmetic surgery  stimulants like Ritalin  Adderall  anti depressants  anabolic steroids  artificial hearts. It's a pretty pathetic list. They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition  but for most people  they don't really transform what it is to be human. And they also all seem a little bit    most people have this instinct that  well  sure  there needs to be anti depressants for the really depressed people. But there's a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way. It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use. We have skin enhancements  clothing. As far as I can see  all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room  so that's a great thing. Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial    caffeine  alcohol  nicotine  immune system enhancement  vision enhancement  anesthetics    we take that very much for granted  but just think about how great progress that is    like  having an operation before anesthetics was not fun. Contraceptives  cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques    that sounds ominous  but the distinction between what is a technology    a gadget would be the archetype    and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle. So if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read  you're actually  literally rewriting your own brain. You're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along. So in a broad sense  we don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets  like these things here  but even institutions and techniques  psychological methods and so forth. Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature. Looking ahead  there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later. We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are  but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws  laws of chemistry  etc. It's possible to assume  setting aside a possibility of catastrophe  that sooner or later we will develop all of these. And even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition. So let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement. Health span is a big and urgent thing  because if you're not alive  then all the other things will be to little avail. Intellectual capacity    let's take that box  which falls into a lot of different sub categories  memory  concentration  mental energy  intelligence  empathy. These are really great things. Part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people    they're positional goods. But part of the reason    and that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these    is that they're also intrinsically valuable. It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with  and to remember what you have learned. Modalities and special faculties. Now  the human mind is not a single unitary information processor  but it has a lot of different  special  evolved modules that do specific things for us. If you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning    music  humor  eroticism  spirituality  aesthetics  nurturing and caring  gossip  chatting with people    all of these  very likely  are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have  but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these. We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it. All of these would enable  in principle    be amenable to enhancement. Some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have. It's also interesting to think about what other things are    so if these all enabled great values  why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be  Imagine a species that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music. And they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance  like the one we just heard    because of people making stupid movements  and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to. But maybe they have another faculty  something else that would seem equally irrational to us  but they actually tap into some great possible value there. But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value. So we could think of adding on different  new sensory capacities and mental faculties. Bodily functionality and morphology and affective self control. Greater subjective well being. Be able to switch between relaxation and activity    being able to go slow when you need to do that  and to speed up. Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do    easier to achieve the flow state  when you're totally immersed in something you are doing. Conscientiousness and sympathy. The ability to    it's another interesting application that would have large social ramification  perhaps. If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person  undiminished through time  so that wouldn't have to    love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to. That's probably not all that difficult. It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this. It's been done in voles. You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it's naturally polygamous. It's just a single gene. Might be more complicated in humans  but perhaps not that much. This is the last picture that I want to    now we've got to use the laser pointer. A possible mode of being here would be a way of life    a way of being  experiencing  thinking  seeing  interacting with the world. Down here in this little corner  here  we have the little sub space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings    beings with our biological capacities. It's a part of the space that's accessible to animals  since we are animals  we are a subset of that. And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities. There would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for  say      years. Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are. So then  you move off to this larger sphere of  human     and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being. Now  why is that a good thing to do  Well  we know already that in this little human circle there  there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being    human life at its best is wonderful. We have no reason to believe that within this much  much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being  perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about. And so  to fix this third problem  I think we need    slowly  carefully  with ethical wisdom and constraint    develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there. Thanks. About    years ago  I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong. And at the time I was very superstitious. So  upon landing    this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that's Kai Tak  when it was smack in the middle of the city    I thought   If I see something good  I'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks. And if I see something negative  I'm going to be miserable  indeed.  So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard. And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there. And it turned out that    I just went to see  you know  what they are doing in Hong Kong. But I actually walked away with a great job offer. And I flew back to Austria  packed my bags  and  another week later  I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking   Well  if that 'Winner' billboard is still up  I'm going to have a good time working here. But if it's gone  it's going to be really miserable and stressful.  So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it. On the other hand  it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong. However  I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life    of  you know  I think what the conference brochure refers to as  moments that take your breath away.  And since I'm a big list maker  I actually listed them all. Now  you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won't read them for you. I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses. What I did do  though is  I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design. And  very surprisingly  over half of them had  actually  something to do with design. So there are  of course  two different possibilities. There's one from a consumer's point of view    where I was happy while experiencing design. And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman. This is     . My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely. And The Police's  Synchronicity  cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz. So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman. And I remember it as a true moment of happiness. You know  of course  they are related to this combination of at least two of them being  you know  design objects. And  you know  there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be  you know  situated somewhere here    right in there between Delight and Bliss. Now  there is the other part  from a designer's standpoint    if you're happy while actually doing it. And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs  So  according to this  the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy. While  somewhat  the Spaniards ... and  I think  particularly  the Swiss don't seem to be doing all that well. Last November  a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum  in a skyscraper  up on the   th floor. And their inaugural exhibit was called  Happiness.  And I went  very eagerly  to see it  because    well  also  with an eye on this conference. And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas. Under  Arcadia   they showed things like this  from the Edo period    a hundred ways to write  happiness  in different forms. Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono    that  of course  later on was  you know  made into the label for The Beatles. Under  Nirvana  they showed this Constable painting. And there was a little    an interesting theory about abstraction. This is a blue field    it's actually an Yves Klein painting. And the theory was that if you abstract an image  you really  you know open as much room for the un representable    and  therefore  you know  are able to involve the viewer more. Then  under  Desire   they showed these Shunsho paintings    also from the Edo period    ink on silk. And  lastly  under  Harmony   they had this   th century mandala from Tibet. Now  what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness. And I felt a little bit cheated  because the visualization    that's a really easy thing to do. And  you know  my studio    we've done it all the time. This is  you know  a book. A happy dog    and you take it out  it's an aggressive dog. It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne. Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face. You know  that's not a big deal to accomplish. It has gotten to the point where  you know  within advertising or within the movie industry   happy  has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic  you almost would have to  you know  do it from a cynical point of view. This is  you know  the movie poster. Or we  a couple of weeks ago  designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has  very much  a dark side to it. Much  much more difficult is this  where the designs actually can evoke happiness    and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me. This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York  who calls himself  True.  Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs  True printed his own version of these signs. Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with    of his friends. They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version. So this is one. Now  the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs. So you're you're really bored in the subway  and you kind of stare at something. And it takes you a while until it actually    you realize that this says something different than what it normally says. I mean  that's  at least  how it made me happy. Now  True is a real humanitarian. He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested  so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card. And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody    sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority. Another New York project. This is at P.S.      a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Turrell  that has a retractable ceiling. Opens up at dusk and dawn every day. You don't see the horizon. You're just in there  watching the incredible  subtle changes of color in the sky. And the room is truly something to be seen. People's demeanor changes when they go in there. And  for sure  I haven't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there. There are  of course  more than those three projects that I'm showing here. I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz'  Cloud  a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy  as well. But my last project is  again  from a young designer in New York. He's from Korea originally. And he took it upon himself to print        speech bubbles    empty speech bubbles stickers  large ones and small ones. And he goes around New York and just puts them  empty as they are  on posters. And other people go and fill them in. This one says   Please let me die in peace.  I think that was    the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good. This is on a musician poster  that says   I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than         units and that  as a result  my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me  after which  my contract will be cancelled  and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street.  I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins. Jee gets to have his project  the public gets a sweeter environment  and different public gets a place to express itself  and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads. Well  there was a question  of course  that was on my mind for a while  You know  can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing  Which brought me back to my list making    you know  just to see what I actually like about my job. You know  one is  just working without pressure. Then  working concentrated  without being frazzled. Or  as Nancy said before  like really immerse oneself into it. Try not to get stuck doing the same thing    or try not get stuck behind the computer all day. This is  you know  related to it  getting out of the studio. Then  of course  trying to  you know  work on things where the content is actually important for me. And being able to enjoy the end results. And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far. And  just about at that time  an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads    design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine  And the whole thing just fell together. So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned    in this case   Everything I do always comes back to me     and we made these spreads right out of this. So it was   Everything I do always comes back to me.  A couple of weeks ago  a French company asked us to design five billboards for them. Again  we could supply the content for it. So I just picked another one. And this was two weeks ago. We flew to Arizona    the designer who works with me  and myself    and photographed this one. So it's   Trying to look good limits my life.  And then we did one more of these. This is  again  for a magazine  dividing pages. This is   Having     this is the same thing  it's just  you know  photographed from the side. This is from the front. Then it's   guts.  Again  it's the same thing     guts  is just the same room  reworked. Then it's   always works out.  Then it's  for   with the light on. And it's  me.  Thank you so much. When I'm starting talks like this  I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there don't know what that is. This is a crowd that does know what it is  so I'll like just do like the    second crib note version. Right  So just bear with me. We'll go real fast  you know  Fill in the blanks. So  you know  sustainability  small planet. Right  Picture a little Earth  circling around the sun. You know  about a million years ago  a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees  got a little clever  harnessed fire  invented the printing press  made  you know  luggage with wheels on it. And  you know  built the society that we now live in. Unfortunately  while this society is  without a doubt  the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created  it's got some major  major flaws. One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint. It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable. How much stuff goes through your life  how much waste is left behind you. And we  at the moment  in our society  have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this. We're using up about five planets. If everybody on the planet lived the way we did  we'd need between five  six  seven  some people even say    planets to make it. Clearly we don't have    planets. Again  you know  mental  visual     planets  one planet     planets  one planet. Right  We don't have that. So that's one problem. The second problem is that the planet that we have is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right  North Americans  such as myself  you know  we're basically sort of wallowing  gluttonous hogs  and we're eating all sorts of stuff. And  you know  then you get all the way down to people who live in the Asia Pacific region  or even more  Africa. And people simply do not have enough to survive. This is producing all sorts of tensions  all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing. And there's more and more people on the way. Right  So  this is what the planet's going to look like in    years. It's going to be a pretty crowded place  at least eight billion people. So to make matters even more difficult  it's a very young planet. A third of the people on this planet are kids. And those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did  no matter where they live. They've been exposed to this idea of our society  of our prosperity. And they may not want to live exactly like us. They may not want to be Americans  or Brits  or Germans  or South Africans  but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous  and more dynamic  and more  you know  enjoyable. And all of these things combine to create an enormous amount of torque on the planet. And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque  we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly facing situations which are simply unthinkable. Everybody in this room has heard the worst case scenarios. I don't need to go into that. But I will ask the question  what's the alternative  And I would say that  at the moment  the alternative is unimaginable. You know  so on the one hand we have the unthinkable  on the other hand we have the unimaginable. We don't know yet how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable  which is shareable with everybody on the planet  which promotes stability and democracy and human rights  and which is achievable in the time frame necessary to make it through the challenges we face. We don't know how to do this yet. So what's Worldchanging  Well  Worldchanging you might think of as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future. You know  what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools  models and ideas  which  if widely adopted  would change the game. A lot of times  when I do a talk like this  I talk about things that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of  but most people haven't. So I thought today I'd do something a little different  and talk about what we're looking for  rather than saying  you know  rather than giving you tried and true examples. Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out. Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook. And given that I have    minutes to do this  this is going to go kind of quick. So  I don't know  just stick with me. Right  So  first of all  what are we looking for  Bright Green city. One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world for changing the impact that we have on the planet is changing the way that we live in cities. We're already an urban planet  that's especially true in the developed world. And people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous  and thus use a lot of stuff. If we can change the dynamic  by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ... Here  for example  is Vancouver  which if you haven't been there  you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city. And they are doing density  new density  better than probably anybody else on the planet right now. They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars  which is a pretty great thing. So you have density. You also have growth management. You leave aside what is natural to be natural. This is in Portland. That is an actual development. That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity. They've bounded the city with a line. Nature  city. Nothing changes. Once you do those things  you can start making all sorts of investments. You can start doing things like  you know  transit systems that actually work to transport people  in effective and reasonably comfortable manners. You can also start to change what you build. This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London  which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place. We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity  that recycle much of their water  that are much more comfortable than standard buildings  use all natural light  etc.  and  over time  cost less. Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night  so I won't dwell on that too much. But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other  one of the things you can do is    as information technologies develop    you can start to have smart places. You can start to know where things are. When you know where things are  it becomes easier to share them. When you share them  you end up using less. So one great example is car share clubs  which are really starting to take off in the U.S.  have already taken off in many places in Europe  and are a great example. If you're somebody who drives  you know  one day a week  do you really need your own car  Another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing  and by monitoring  the amount we're actually using. So  here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use  which I think is a pretty cool concept  although I think it ought to work the other way around  that it gets brighter the more you don't use. But  you know  there may even be a simpler approach. We could just re label things. This light switch that reads  on the one hand  flashfloods  and on the other hand  off. How we build things can change as well. This is a bio morphic building. It takes its inspiration in form from life. Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful  and also much more effective. This is an example of bio mimicry  which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for. In this case  you have a shell design which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan  which is greatly more effective. There's a lot of this stuff happening  it's really pretty remarkable. I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it. We're starting to cover this more and more. There's also neo biological design  where more and more we're actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry. So this  for example  is hydrogen generating algae. So we have a model in potential  an emerging model that we're looking for of how to take the cities most of us live in  and turn them into Bright Green cities. But unfortunately  most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in. They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world. And there's a statistic I often like to use  which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days  a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days. I was giving a talk about two months ago  and this guy  who'd done some work with the U.N.  came up to me and was really flustered  and he said  look  you've got that totally wrong  it's totally wrong. It's every seven days. So  we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days  and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in. Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly. They don't have existing infrastructure  they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty  and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out how to do things in new ways. So what do we need in order to make developing nation megacities into Bright Green megacities  Well  the first thing we need is  we need leapfrogging. And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere. The idea behind leapfrogging is that if you are a person  or a country  who is stuck in a situation where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need  there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right  That you're much better off  almost universally  looking for a low cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology. One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right  All throughout the developing world  people are going directly to cell phones  skipping the whole landline stage. If there are landlines in many developing world cities  they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot and cost enormous amounts of money. So I rather like this picture here. I particularly like the Ganesh in the background  talking on the cell phone. So what we have  increasingly  is cell phones just permeating out through society. We've heard all about this here this week  so I won't say too much more than that  other than to say what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies. The second thing is tools for collaboration  be they systems of collaboration  or intellectual property systems which encourage collaboration. Right  When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate  you get different kinds of solutions. And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital. Right  So  you know  we have open source software  we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions. And those things lead to things like this. This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo. This is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software  cheap  sort of hacked together machines  and basically sort of abandoned buildings    has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in  get high speed internet access  learn computer programming skills for free. And a quarter million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo. And those quarter million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo. I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back.  Laughter  So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion. And one of the things we're really  really interested in at Worldchanging is the ways in which the south is re identifying itself  and re categorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room. So it's not  you know  Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right  You know  Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels. It's doing something new. There's new things happening. There's interplay between them. And  you know  you get amazing things. Like  I don't know if any of you have seen the movie  City of God   Yeah  it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it. And it's all about this question  in a very artistic and indirect kind of way. You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out. These are people who have just been visited by the Internet bookmobile in Uganda. And who are waving their first books in the air  which  I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know  So you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways  in ways that haven't happened before. And as we heard last night  as we've heard earlier this week  are absolutely  fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions  is we've got to craft new political realities. And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities  not only in places like India  Afghanistan  Kenya  Pakistan  what have you  but here at home as well. Another world is possible. And sort of the big motto of the anti globalization movement. Right  We tweak that a lot. We talk about how another world isn't just possible  another world's here. That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different  vague possibility out there  but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility. We need to start doing things like Lula  President of Brazil. How many people knew of Lula before today  OK  so  much  much better than the average crowd  I can tell you that. So Lula  he's full of problems  full of contradictions  but one of the things that he's doing is  he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration. I would keep your eye on this fellow. Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call  serious play.  We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere. This is from  A Force More Powerful.  It's a little screenshot.  A Force More Powerful  is a video game that  while you're playing it  it teaches you how to engage in non violent insurrection and regime change.  Laughter  Here's another one. This is from a game called  Food Force   which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp. These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way to a huge rise in  especially in the developing world  in people's interest in and passion for democracy. We get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer  freer  more democratic  less corrupt. And  you know  we don't hear those stories enough. But it's happening all over the place  and these tools are part of what's making it possible. Now when you add all those things together  when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools  you know  second superpower stuff  etc.  what do you get  Well  very quickly  you get a Bright Green future for the developing world. You get  for example  green power spread throughout the world. You get    this is a building in Hyderabad  India. It's the greenest building in the world. You get grassroots solutions  things that work for people who have no capital or limited access. You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains. You get access to distance medicine. These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs to access databases that have information that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner. You get new tools for people in the developing world. These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there  for whom nightfall means darkness  to have a new means of operating. These are refrigerators that require no electricity  they're pot within a pot design. And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems. Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap and available to people in the developing world. Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight. Here's a fog catcher  which  if you live in a moist  jungle like area  will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable. Here's a way of transporting water. I just love this  you know    I mean carrying water is such a drag  and somebody just came up with the idea of well  what if you rolled it. Right  I mean  that's a great design. This is a fabulous invention  LifeStraw. Basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips. So  you know  people who are in desperate straits can get this. This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever. This is a merry go round invented by the company Roundabout  which pumps water as kids play. You know  Seriously    give that one a hand  it's pretty great. And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right  We're expecting to have upwards of     million refugees by the year      because of climate change and political instability. How do we help people like that  Well  there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet. Some of those designs include models for acting  such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps. New models for pedagogy for the displaced. And we have new tools. This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere. Does anyone know what this is  Audience  It detects landmines. Alex Steffen  Exactly  this is a landmine detecting flower. If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half billion unaccounted for mines are scattered  you can fling these seeds out into the field. And as they grow up  they will grow up around the mines  their roots will detect the chemicals in them  and where the flowers turn red you don't step. Yeah  so seeds that could save your life. You know  I also love it because it seems to me that the example  the tools we use to change the world  ought to be beautiful in themselves. You know  that it's not just enough to survive. We've got to make something better than what we've got. And I think that we will. Just to wrap up  in the immortal words of H.G. Wells  I think that better things are on the way. I think that  in fact  that  all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning. All that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening.  I hope that that turns out to be true. The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will. Thank you very much. I work with a species called  Bonobo.  And I'm happy most of the time  because I think this is the happiest species on the planet. It's kind of a well kept secret. This species lives only in the Congo. And they're not in too many zoos  because of their sexual behavior. Their sexual behavior is too human like for most of us to be comfortable with. But    actually  we have a lot to learn from them  because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society. And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside. It permeates their entire life. And it's used for communication. And it's used for conflict resolution. And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of  divided our lives up into lots of parts. We divided our world up with lots of categories. And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit. But I don't think that we were that way initially. There are many people who think that the animal world is hard wired and that there's something very  very special about man. Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought. Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language. Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics. Well  I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the     s and they had no fire. They had no stone tools. To our knowledge they had no music. So when you compare them to the Bonobo  the Bonobo is a little hairier. He doesn't stand quite as upright. But there are a lot of similarities. And I think that as we look at culture  we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are. And I don't really think it's in our biology  I think we've attributed it to our biology  but I don't really think it's there. So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo. This is Kanzi. He's a Bonobo. Right now  he's in a forest in Georgia. His mother originally came from a forest in Africa. And she came to us when she was just at puberty  about six or seven years of age. Now this shows a Bonobo on your right  and a chimpanzee on your left. Clearly  the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking. The Bonobo  although shorter than us and their arms still longer  is more upright  just as we are. This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy. As you can see  there's not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked. As they turn toward us you'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side. So the    the bipedal gait is a little easier. And now we see all four. Video  Narrator  The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa  in the jungle encircled by the Congo River. Canopied trees as tall as    meters      feet  grow densely in the area. It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo  almost three decades ago. Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee. Slim bodied  Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures. Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them. One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally. What's more  they are able to walk upright for long distances. Susan Savage Rumbaugh  video   Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame. SS  This is Kanzi and I  in the forest. None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained. None of them are tricks. They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously  by NHK of Japan. We have eight Bonobos. Video  Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire. SS  An entire family at our research centre. Video  You going to help get some sticks  Good. We need more sticks  too. I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one. That's a wasps' nest. You can get it out. I hope I have a lighter. You can use the lighter to start the fire. SS  So Kanzi is very interested in fire. He doesn't do it yet without a lighter  but I think if he saw someone do it  he might be able to do    make a fire without a lighter. He's learning about how to keep a fire going. He's learning the uses for a fire  just by watching what we do with fire. This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo. These are happy vocalizations. Video  You're happy. You're very happy about this part. You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water  Good job. SS  Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack. But he likes to carry things from place to place. Video  Austin  I hear you saying  Austin.  SS  He talks to other Bonobos at the lab  long distance  farther than we can hear. This is his sister. This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart. Video  Goodbye. SS  She's got the pedals down  but not the wheel. She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel  rather than turns it. Like us  she knows that that individual in the mirror is her. Video  Narrator  By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human  and documenting their development across two decades  scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution. His name is Nyota. It means  star  in Swahili. Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors. In the wild  the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring. Here Panbanisha uses scissors  instead of her hands  to groom Nyota. Very impressive. Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this. Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself. Realizing that Nyota might get hurt  Panbanisha  like any human mother  carefully tugs to get the scissors back. He can now cut through tough animal hide. SS  Kanzi's learned to make stone tools. Video  Kanzi now makes his tools  just as our ancestors may have made them  two and a half million years ago    by holding the rocks in both hands  to strike one against the other. He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows  he can make much larger  sharper flakes. Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough. The tough hide is difficult to cut  even with a knife. The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making  but difficult to handle  requiring great skill. Kanzi's rock is from Gona  Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two and a half million years ago. These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made. The flat sharp edges are like knife blades. Compare them to the tools our ancestors used  they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's. Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods. She keeps staring out the window. SS  This is    let me show you something we didn't think they would do. Video  For several days now  Panbanisha has not been outside. SS  I normally talk about language. Video  Then Panbanisha does something unexpected. SS  But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do  I haven't told you that these apes have language. It's a geometric language. Video  She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor. What is she writing  SS  She's also saying the name of that  with her voice. Video  Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again. SS  These are her symbols on her keyboard. They speak when she touches them. Video  Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.  A frame  represents a hut in the woods. Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard. Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor. SS  video   Very nice. Beautiful  Panbanisha. SS  At first we didn't really realize what she was doing  until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it. Video  This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods. The curved line is very similar to the lexigram. The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents  collar.  It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out. SS  That's an institutional requirement. Video  This symbol is not as clear as the others  but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines. Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said  by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk. Panbanisha watched. Soon she began to write as well. The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world. How did they develop  SS  video   We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them. It's simply to use language around them  because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others  that are important to you  are saying to you. Once you have that capacity  the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely. So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos  like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting    we want to create an environment in which they have fun  and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them. Narrator  This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha. Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica  until Nyota  now one year old  steals it. Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth. Is he looking for where the sound came from  Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish. This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano. She wasn't forced to learn the piano  she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest. Researcher  Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening. Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah  that part. Narrator  Kanzi plays the xylophone  using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing. Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun filled environment  which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities. Researcher  OK  now get the monsters. Get them. Take the cherries too. Now watch out  stay away from them now. Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them. Now you have to stay away. Get away. Run away. Run. Now we can chase them again. Go get them. Oh no  Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much. Narrator  None of us  Bonobo or human  can possibly even imagine  SS  So we have a bi species environment  we call it a  panhomoculture.  We're learning how to become like them. We're learning how to communicate with them  in really high pitched tones. We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild. And they're learning to become like us. Because we believe that it's not biology  it's culture. So we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species. Thank you. If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster  we have some here. And that's not a joke  we really do. So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster. So  actually  I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp a few years ago because they make sound. This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of California. And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound  it actually turns out to be a very difficult project. And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp  or stomatopods  make sound  I started to think about their appendages. And mantis shrimp are called  mantis shrimp  after the praying mantises  which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think  well  maybe it will be interesting  while listening to their sounds  to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes. And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike  work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell. So  mantis shrimp come in two varieties  there are spearers and smashers. And this is a spearing mantis shrimp  or stomatopod. And he lives in the sand  and he catches things that go by overhead. So  a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit  this is the mantis shrimp    the same species    recorded at       frames a second  played back at    frames per second. And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs  exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it. Now  the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod  and these guys open up snails for a living. And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack. So  I'll play it one more time. He wiggles it in place  tugs it with his nose  and smash. And a few smashes later  the snail is broken open  and he's got a good dinner. So  the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end  or it can smash with the heel. And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike. And so the first question that came to mind was  well  how fast does this limb move  Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video. And I immediately came upon a problem. Every single high speed video system in the biology department at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement. We simply couldn't capture it on video. And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time. And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department  looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology. And so we struck up a deal. I said   Well  if you guys rent the high speed video system that could capture these movements  you guys can film us collecting the data.  And believe it or not  they went for it.  Laughter  So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology    it just came out about a year ago    that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light. And low light is a critical issue with filming animals  because if it's too high  you fry them.  Laughter  So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here  and there's that raptorial appendage  and there's the heel. And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail. And the snail's wired to a stick  so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And    yeah. I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here. So this was filmed at       frames per second  and I'm playing it back at   . And so this is slowed down     times. And as you'll notice  it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down     times. It's an incredibly powerful movement. The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards    just a spectacular movement. And so what we did is  we took a look at these videos  and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question. And we were in for our first surprise. So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from    meters per second all the way up to    meters per second. And for those of you who prefer miles per hour  that's over    miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast. In fact  it's so fast we were able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum. And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system. So our first surprise. So that was really cool and very unexpected. So  you might be wondering  well  how do they do it  And actually  this work was done in the     s by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows. And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what's called a  catch mechanism   or  click mechanism.  And what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract  and a latch that prevents anything from moving. So the muscle contracts  and nothing happens. And once the muscle's contracted completely  everything's stored up    the latch flies upward  and you've got the movement. And that's basically what's called a  power amplification system.  It takes a long time for the muscle to contract  and a very short time for the limb to fly out. And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story. This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes. But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History. And if any of you ever have a chance  backstage of the National Museum of Natural History is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what    this is serious business for me. So  this    what I saw  on every single mantis shrimp limb  whether it's a spearer or a smasher  is a beautiful saddle shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here. It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse. It's a very beautiful structure. And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure. And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while. And then we did a series of calculations  and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring. There needs to be some kind of spring loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe  and the speed that we observe  and the output of the system. So we thought  OK  this must be a spring    the saddle could very well be a spring. And we went back to those high speed videos again  and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending. And I'll just do that one more time. And then if you take a look at the video    it's a little bit hard to see    it's outlined in yellow. The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it extending over the course of the strike  and actually hyperextending. So  we've had very solid evidence showing that that saddle shaped structure actually compresses and extends  and does  in fact  function as a spring. The saddle shaped structure is also known as a  hyperbolic paraboloid surface   or an  anticlastic surface.  And this is very well known to engineers and architects  because it's a very strong surface in compression. It has curves in two directions  one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other  so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape. So it's very well known to engineers  not as well known to biologists. It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry  because it requires very little material to build this type of surface  and it's very strong. So if you're going to build a thin gold structure  it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong. Now  it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects is Eduardo Catalano  who popularized this structure. And what's shown here is a saddle shaped roof that he built that's    and a half feet spanwise. It's two and a half inches thick  and supported at two points. And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's    he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points. And all of these are the same principles that apply to the saddle shaped spring in stomatopods. In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it. So  very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds. And interestingly  this turns out    the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring. That's a bit long  but it is sort of interesting. So the next and final question was  well  how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails  And so I wired up what's called a load cell. A load cell measures forces  and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it. And when this crystal is squeezed  the electrical properties change and it    which    in proportion to the forces that go in. So these animals are wonderfully aggressive  and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell  and they'd smash away at it. And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell. And we were able to get some force measurements out. And again  we were in for a surprise. I purchased a     pound load cell  thinking  no animal could produce more than     pounds at this size of an animal. And what do you know  They immediately overloaded the load cell. So these are actually some old data where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab  and we were able to measure forces of well over     pounds generated by an animal about this big. And actually  just last week I got a     pound load cell up and running  and I've clocked these animals generating well over     pounds of force. And again  I think this will be a world record. I have to do a little bit more background reading  but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given    per body mass. So  really incredible forces. And again  that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system. But that was not the end of the story. Now  things    I'm making this sound very easy  this is actually a lot of work. And I got all these force measurements  and then I went and looked at the force output of the system. And this is just very simple    time is on the X axis and the force is on the Y axis. And you can see two peaks. And that was what really got me puzzled. The first peak  obviously  is the limb hitting the load cell. But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later  and I didn't know what that was. So now  you'd expect a second peak for other reasons  but not half a millisecond later. Again  going back to those high speed videos  there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on. Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier. There's that raptorial appendage    there's the heel  and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell. And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this  on the surface of the load cell  as the limb comes flying through. And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light. Audience  Wow. Sheila Patek  And so if we just take that one frame  what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble. And what that is  is cavitation. And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds. And when this happens  it can cause areas of very low pressure  which results in the water literally vaporizing. And when that vapor bubble collapses  it emits sound  light and heat  and it's a very destructive process. And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again  this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon  because it destroys boat propellers. People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it  just like these pictures show. So this is a potent force in fluid systems  and just to sort of take it one step further  I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail. This is taken at        frames per second  and I have to give full credit to the BBC cameraman  Tim Green  for setting this shot up  because I could never have done this in a million years    one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen. You can see it coming in  and an incredible flash of light  and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail. So really  just an amazing image  slowed down extremely  to extremely slow speeds. And again  we can see it in slightly different form there  with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces. In fact  you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb. So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks  what I think was going on is  that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell  and the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble. And these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring  but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail. So  really fascinating double whammy  so to speak  from these animals. So  one question I often get after this talk    so I figured I'd answer it now    is  well  what happens to the animal  Because obviously  if it's breaking snails  the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does. That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images  and it gets worn away. In fact  I've seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh. But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod is that you have to molt. And every three months or so these animals molt  and they build a new limb and it's no problem. Very  very convenient solution to that particular problem. So  I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note. Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you  I don't know. So  the saddles    that saddle shaped spring    has actually been well known to biologists for a long time  not as a spring but as a visual signal. And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods. And this is quite interesting  to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really  in all species  their spring. And I think one explanation for this could be going back to the molting phenomenon. So these animals go into a molting period where they're unable to strike    their bodies become very soft. And they're literally unable to strike or they will self destruct. This is for real. And what they do is  up until that time period when they can't strike  they become really obnoxious and awful  and they strike everything in sight  it doesn't matter who or what. And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more  they just signal. They wave their legs around. And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing. It's a well established fact of these animals that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike  but they pretend to. And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike  or their strike force  and something about the time period in the molting cycle. So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring. So to conclude  I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators  Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell  who worked closely with me on this. And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science  which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time  and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much. We're going to talk    my    a new lecture  just for TED    and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED  and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking about with happiness is  what gives happiness    or happiness  which I equate with joy in my particular area  and I think there's something very fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected twist    something that you didn't expect    and you find a joyful experience. You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what you'd expect. And there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things. So  what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean  sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant  but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way  in a very primal way  so I can make the audience here happy. So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations. First of all  I want to show you the particular illusion here. I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed  and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. Now watch  as it rotates back  how quickly your perception snaps. OK now. Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very bright audience  all right  See if you can stop it from happening  even though you know     percent it's true that    bam  You can't undo it. What does that tell you about yourselves  We're going to do it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop it from happening. No. It's difficult. And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation  about shape  about color and so forth and it's very primal. And it's an interesting question to ponder  why these things    we find these things joyful. Why would we find them joyful  So  here's something that Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of little things like this. Again  this is not an optical trick. This is what you would see. In other words  it's not a camera cut. It's a perceptual trick. OK. We can violate your expectations about shape. We can violate your expectations on representation    what an image represents. What do you see here  How many of you here see dolphins  Raise your hand if you see dolphins. OK  those people who raised their hands  afterwards  the rest of the audience  go talk to them  all right  Actually  this is the best example of priming by experience that I know. If you are a child under the age of    who haven't been ruined yet  you will look at this image and see dolphins. Now  some of you adults here are saying   What dolphins  What dolphins   But in fact  if you reversed the figure ground    in other words  the dark areas here    I forgot to ask for a pointer    but if you reverse it  you'll see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way  if you're also a student at CalTech    they also tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on experience. Now  something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design  too. This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi  and they actually got away with this ad in Australia. So  if you look at this ad for beer  all those people are in sort of provocative positions. But they got it passed  and actually won the Clio awards  so it's funny how you can do these things. Remember that sort of  um. This is the joke I did when the Florida ballot was going around. You know  count the dots for Gore  count the dots for Bush  count 'em again ... You can violate your expectations about experience. Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine  but you can stop the water in drops and    actually make all the drops levitate. This is something we're building for  you know  amusement parks and that kind of stuff. Now let's take a static image. Can you see this  Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up  It's completely static. It's a static image. How many people see this illusion  It's completely static. Right. Now  when    it's interesting that when we look at an image we see  you know  color  depth  texture. And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil. And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond. Now  you can make design mistakes. Like this building in New York. So that when you see it from this side  it looks like the balconies tilt up  and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down. So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions. Or  you take this particular un retouched photograph. Now  interestingly enough  I get a lot of emails from people who say   Is there any perceptual difference between males and females   And I really say   No.  I mean  women can navigate through the world just as well as males can    and why wouldn't they  However  this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males  in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat. Okay  now getting to a part    I want to show design in illusions. I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So that when you saw from one little angle was like this. And this little technique got popular in the   th century and the   th century to disguise hidden meanings  where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this. But these are early incorporations of illusions brought to    sort of high point with Hans Holbein's  Ambassadors.  And Hans Holbein worked for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull. All right  now I'm going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one here on TED and happiness. OK now. Arthur  Ganson  hasn't talked yet  but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside. And so  we    Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson. Well  there's analog and digital. Thought that was appropriate here. And figure goes to ground. And for the musicians. And of course  since happiness    we want  joy to the world.  Now  another great designer    he's very well known in Japan    Shigeo Fukuda. And he just builds some fantastic things. This is simply amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle  you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano. Pianist transforms to violinist. This is really wild. This assemblage of forks  knives and spoons and various cutlery  welded together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn something in the sort of thing that I do  which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands. Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images  like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells    un retouched seashells  but just by rearranging them. He did Einstein out of dice because  after all  Einstein said   God does not play dice with the universe.  Bert Herzog out of un retouched keyboards. Will Shortz  crossword puzzle. John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil cabinets. Now  I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running  behind . I want to show you quickly what I've created  some new type of illusions. I've done something with taking the Pixar type illusions. So you see these kids the same size here  running down the hall. The two table tops of the same size. They're looking out two directions at once. You have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And that's something for you to think about  all right  So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that  Which is impossible. You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once. Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape  They are. So  if you measured them  they would be. And as I say  those two figures are identical in size and shape. And it's interesting  by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion  how much stronger the illusions are. Any case  I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness  and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects  see me outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things. I'm supposed to scare you  because it's about fear  right  And you should be really afraid  but not for the reasons why you think you should be. You should be really afraid that    if we stick up the first slide on this thing    there we go    that you're missing out. Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market  you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on. And this is what this adventure's really about. This is crystallized DNA. Every life form on this planet    every insect  every bacteria  every plant  every animal  every human  every politician     Laughter  is coded in that stuff. And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA  it looks like that. And we're just beginning to understand this stuff. And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on. It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on. If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference  or landing on the moon  or this other stuff  it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference. And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution. It turns out that what this stuff is    and Richard Dawkins has written about this    is  this is really a river out of Eden. So  the  .  billion base pairs inside each of your cells is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years. And we could start dating things  and we could start changing medicine and archeology. It turns out that if you take the human species about     years ago  white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way. White Europeans were subject to the plague. And when they were subject to the plague  most people didn't survive  but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR  receptor. And that mutation was passed on to their kids because they're the ones that survived  so there was a great deal of population pressure. In Africa  because you didn't have these cities  you didn't have that CCR  population pressure mutation. We can date it to     years ago. That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is  and not as fast across Europe. And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria  for sickle cell  for cancers. And in the measure that we map ourselves  this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on. And this Friday  I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine  and I want you to toast these two people. Because this Friday     years ago  Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA  and that is almost as important a date as the   th of February when we first mapped ourselves  but anyway  we'll get to that. I thought we'd talk about the new zoo. So  all you guys have heard about DNA  all the stuff that DNA does  but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet. If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful  it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there. And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there  which is part of the reason why this whole species mapping project is so important. Because we're just beginning to learn where we came from and what we are. And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia. And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much  except that each of you has about  .  billion letters  which is what makes you you  as far as gene code inside each of your cells  and this little amoeba which  you know  sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions  turns out to have     billion base pairs of gene code inside. So  this little thingamajig has a genome that's     times the size of yours. And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms  it may not turn out to be chips. It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba. And  again  we're learning from life and how life works. This funky little thing  people didn't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and  of course  nothing lived there. And then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores. And sitting next to that water in the cores was this little Deinococcus radiodurans  doing a backstroke  having its chromosomes blown apart every day  six  seven times  restitching them  living in about     times the radiation that would kill you. And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is  and how many different life forms there are  and how there can be different life forms living in very different places  maybe even outside of this planet. Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this  that brings up a whole series of interesting questions. This little thingamajig  we didn't know this thingamajig existed. We should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye. So  this thing is  .   millimeters. It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia. And what you're looking at with this namibiensis is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen. So  it's about the size of a little period on a sentence. Again  we didn't know this thing was there three years ago. We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo. This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma. The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron  lives inside the equivalent of battery acid  and excretes sulfuric acid. So  when you think of odd life forms  when you think of what it takes to live  it turns out this is a very efficient life form  and they call it an archaea. Archaea means  the ancient ones.  And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries  and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core. So  it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey. Your fear should be that you are not  that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal. I mean  George Bush    he's going to be gone  alright  Life isn't. Whether the humans survive or don't survive  these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets. And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure that we've ever been on. And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gar. Conservation group gets together  tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct. They can't do it naturally  so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon  take some cells out of an adult gar's mouth  code  take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg  reprogram cow's egg    different gene code. When you do that  the cow gives birth to a gar. We are now experimenting with bongos  pandas  elims  Sumatran tigers  and the Australians    bless their hearts    are playing with these things. Now  the last of these things died in September     . These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo. But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species  we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA. And when we learn how to close the gene gaps  then we can put a full string of DNA together. And if we do that  and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg  we may give birth to an animal that hasn't walked the earth since     . And then you can start going back further  and you can start thinking about dodos  and you can think about other species. And in other places  like Maryland  they're trying to figure out what the primordial ancestor is. Because each of us contains our entire gene code of where we've been for the past billion years  because we've evolved from that stuff  you can take that tree of life and collapse it back  and in the measure that you learn to reprogram  maybe we'll give birth to something that is very close to the first primordial ooze. And it's all coming out of things that look like this. These are companies that didn't exist five years ago. Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields. Some are public. Some are private. It takes about   billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time. Takes about   million dollars the second time. We will have a       dollar genome within the next five to eight years. That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code. And it will be really boring. It will read like this. The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life. And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit. Because if you happen to find this one inside your body  you're in big trouble  because that's the source code for Ebola. That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans. But plants work the same way and insects work the same way  and this apple works the same way. This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk. Because this thing codes ones and zeros  and this thing codes A  T  C  Gs  and it sits up there  absorbing energy on a tree  and one fine day it has enough energy to say  execute  and it goes  thump . Right  And when it does that  pushes a .EXE  what it does is  it executes the first line of code  which reads just like that  AATCAGGGACCC  and that means  make a root. Next line of code  make a stem. Next line of code  TACGGGG  make a flower that's white  that blooms in the spring  that smells like this. In the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it    and  by the way  the first plant was read two years ago  the first human was read two years ago  the first insect was read two years ago. The first thing that we ever read was in       a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae. In the measure that you have the source code  as all of you know  you can change the source code  and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine  or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials  which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn. This changes all rules. This is life  but we're reprogramming it. This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes. And what you can do now is  you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is  and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here  and what those genes code for  and what animals they code against  and then you can tie it to the literature. And in the measure that you can do that  you can go home today  and get on the Internet  and access the world's biggest public library  which is a library of life. And you can do some pretty strange things because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple  if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School  he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings. Why would Cliff be doing that  He doesn't have a restaurant. The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child  and you picked up the lizard  sometimes the tail fell off  but it regrew. Not so in human beings  you cut off an arm  you cut off a leg    it doesn't regrow. But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code  each cell can be reprogrammed  if we don't stop stem cell research and if we don't stop genomic research  to express different body functions. And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings  and what the program is for those cells to differentiate  one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells  which you know as cancer  and one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone  stomach  skin  pancreas. And you are likely to be wandering around    and your children    on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time  in some places in the world where they don't stop the research. How's this stuff work  If each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand  but only three percent codes  which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent  very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence. Right  That's perfectly clear. So  men read that sentence  and they look at that sentence  and they read this. Okay  Now  women look at that sentence and they say  uh uh  wrong. This is the way it should be seen. That's what your genes are doing. That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand. Right  But  you know  he's reasonably good looking  but... I won't go there. You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation. You can look at this  right  And they look at the world a little differently. They look at the same world and they say... That's how the same gene code    that's why you have        genes  mice have        genes  husbands have        genes. Mice and men are the same. Wives know that  but anyway. You can make very small changes in gene code and get really different outcomes  even with the same string of letters. That's what your genes are doing every day. That's why sometimes a person's genes don't have to change a lot to get cancer. These little chippies  these things are the size of a credit card. They will test any one of you for        genetic conditions. That brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff  but it also allows us to start going after diseases  because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this  it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes are completely different diseases. Because in ALL leukemia  that set of genes over there over expresses. In MLL  it's the middle set of genes  and in AML  it's the bottom set of genes. And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body  then you take Gleevec and you're cured. If it is not expressing in your body  if you don't have one of those types    a particular one of those types    don't take Gleevec. It won't do anything for you. Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer. Don't have an HER   receptor  Don't take Receptin. Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine. Changes the way medicine works. The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college was this thing  and it turns out that this is not so important any more. The U.S. Library of Congress  in terms of its printed volume of data  contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month on a compound basis. Let me say that again  A single genomics company generates more data in a month  on a compound basis  than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress. This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law. So  all of you know that the price of computers halves every    months and the power doubles  right  Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data's being deposited in GenBank  Moore's Law is right here  it's the blue line. This is on a log scale  and that's what superexponential growth means. This is going to push computers to have to grow faster than they've been growing  because so far  there haven't been applications that have been required that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does. And here's an interesting map. This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School. One of the really interesting questions is  if all this data's free  who's using it  This is the greatest public library in the world. Well  it turns out that there's about    trillion bits moving inside from the United States to the United States  about  .  trillion is going over to those European countries  about  . 's going to Japan  there's almost no communication between Japan  and nobody else is literate in this stuff. It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war  they're focusing on Bush  they're not interested in life. So  this is what a new map of the world looks like. That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem. In fact  it's not a genomically literate world. You can break this out by states. And you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life  and you can watch New York fall off a cliff  and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff  and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence. And you can break it out by counties  because it's specific counties. And if you want to get more specific  it's actually specific zip codes. So  you want to know where life is happening  Well  in Southern California it's happening in      . And that's it. And that's the triangle between Salk  Scripps  UCSD  and it's called Torrey Pines Road. That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful  it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful  and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country in about three or four carefully picked    s. Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but    oh  by the way  the ones that are the same color are contiguous. What's the net effect of this  In an agricultural society  the difference between the richest and the poorest  the most productive and the least productive  was five to one. Why  Because in agriculture  if you had    kids and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder  you could produce about five times more wealth  on average  than your neighbor. In a knowledge society  that number is now     to  . It really matters if you're literate  not just in reading and writing in English and French and German  but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple. And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code. So  if there is something you should fear  it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball. Because it really matters who speaks life. That's why nations rise and fall. And it turns out that if you went back to the     s  the most productive nation on earth was Australia  per person. And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about       and then Switzerland about       and then the U.S. got back on top    beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks. And today  of course  you all know that the most productive nation on earth is Luxembourg  producing about one third more wealth per person per year than America. Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources. Just smart people moving bits. Different rules. Here's differential productivity rates. Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent. So  about       Americans        Koreans         Brits          Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing  It's got nothing to do with inflation. It's got nothing to do with privatization. You can take a Harvard educated Ivy League economist  stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country because he doesn't understand how the rules have changed. Oh  yeah  and it takes about  .  million Indians. Well  watch what happens to India. India and China used to be    percent of the global economy just at the Industrial Revolution  and they are now about  .  percent. Two billion people. One third of the global population producing   percent of the wealth because they didn't get this change  because they kept treating their people like serfs instead of like shareholders of a common project. They didn't keep the people who were educated. They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs. Silicon Valley did. And that's why they say that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs. Not integrated circuits  Indians and Chinese. Here's what's happening in the world. It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in       when it was founded  there were    countries in this world. It turns out there's now about    . Country after country is splitting  seceding  succeeding  failing    and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped. In the     s  these are sovereign states that did not exist before     . And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags. We're generating about  .   states per year. People are taking control of their own states  sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. And the really interesting thing is  you and your kids are empowered to build great empires  and you don't need a lot to do it. And  given that the music is over  I was going to talk about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth  and how code works. Moderator  Two minutes. Juan Enriquez  No  I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year because I don't want to take any of Laurie's time. But thank you very much. I'd like to begin this song I wrote about ceaseless yearning and never ending want with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder   I find no peace  and all my war is done  I fear and hope  I burn and freeze like ice  I fly above the wind  and yet I cannot arise  And naught I have  and all the world I seize upon.

Now  I've got a story for you. When I arrived off the plane  after a very long journey from the West of England  my computer  my beloved laptop  had gone mad  and had    oh     a bit like that     and the display on it    anyway  the whole thing had burst. And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer  and then he said   What are you doing here   and I said  I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing   and he said   Oh  I sort of play the cello as well.  And I said   Do you really   Anyway  so you're in for a treat  because he's fantastic  and his name's Mark. I am also joined by my partner in crime  Thomas Dolby. This song is called  Farther than the Sun.    Strung in the wind I called you     but you did not hear ...     And you're a plant that needs poor soil     and I have treated you too well     to give up flowers ...     Oh  I have been too rich for you ...     Farther than the sun from me     Farther than I'd have you be     And I go north  I get so cold     My heart is lava under stone     You are not worthy     You are not worthy ...     With your calculating eyes     spinning figures     you cannot see me     You cannot see me ...     And if I tell myself enough     I'll believe it     You are not worthy     The sea  it freezes over ...     to trap the light     And I'm in love with being in love     and you were never quite the one     In Gerda's eyes     Fragments of what you've become     And all the moths that fly at night     believe electric light is bright     You are not worthy     You are not worthy     With your calculating eyes     Spinning figures     You cannot see me  no     And if I tell myself enough     I'll believe it     You are not worthy     Farther than the sun from me     Farther than I'd have you be     And I go north  I get so cold     My heart is lava under stone     You are not worthy     You are not worthy     With your calculating eyes     Spinning figures     You cannot see me  no ...     And if I tell myself enough  I'll believe it   Thank you very much. So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that's that I'm a philosopher. When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say   I'm a professor   their eyes glaze over. When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around  they ask me what field I'm in and I say   philosophy     their eyes glaze over. When I go to a philosopher's party and they ask me what I work on and I say   consciousness   their eyes don't glaze over    their lips curl into a snarl. And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think   That's impossible  You can't explain consciousness.  The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question. My late  lamented friend Bob Nozick  a fine philosopher  in one of his books   Philosophical Explanations   is commenting on the ethos of philosophy    the way philosophers go about their business. And he says  you know   Philosophers love rational argument.  And he says   It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion  and if they don't accept the conclusion  they die. Their heads explode.  The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents. But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all. It's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness  and I finally figured out the reason for that. The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness. We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games. They all have an idea for a video game  even if they're not experts. But they don't consider themselves experts on video games  they've just got strong opinions. I'm sure that people here who work on  say  climate change and global warming  or on the future of the Internet  encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next. But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise. They're just strongly held opinions. But with regard to consciousness  people seem to think  each of us seems to think   I am an expert. Simply by being conscious  I know all about this.  And so  you tell them your theory and they say   No  no  that's not the way consciousness is  No  you've got it all wrong.  And they say this with an amazing confidence. And so what I'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling    I can feel it myself. I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds    that you are  yourselves  authoritative about your own consciousness. That's the order of the day here. Now  this nice picture shows a thought balloon  a thought bubble. I think everybody understands what that means. That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness. This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done. It's a Saul Steinberg of course    it was a New Yorker cover. And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque. That reminds him of the word baroque  barrack  bark  poodle  Suzanne R.    he's off to the races. There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along  you learn a lot about this man. What I particularly like about this picture  too  is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style. Which reminds us  as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday  what we are  what each of us is    what you are  what I am    is approximately     trillion little cellular robots. That's what we're made of. No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells  about     trillion of them. Not a single one of those cells is conscious  not a single one of those cells knows who you are  or cares. Somehow  we have to explain how when you put together teams  armies  battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells    not so different really from a bacterium  each one of them    the result is this. I mean  just look at it. The content    there's color  there's ideas  there's memories  there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons. How is that possible  Many people just think it isn't possible at all. They think   No  there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness.  This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel  who's a professor of religion  actually  at the University of Hawaii  and he's an expert magician  and an expert on the street magic of India  which is what this book is about   Net of Magic.  And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you. It speaks so eloquently to the problem.  'I'm writing a book on magic ' I explain  and I'm asked  'Real magic ' By 'real magic ' people mean miracles  thaumaturgical acts  and supernatural powers. 'No ' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks  not real magic.' 'Real magic ' in other words  refers to the magic that is not real  while the magic that is real  that can actually be done  is not real magic.  Now  that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness. Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks. If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks  then it's not real consciousness  whatever it is. And  as Marvin said  and as other people have said   Consciousness is a bag of tricks.  This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness. So this is the problem. So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like  for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you. How many of you here  if somebody    some smart aleck    starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done  you sort of want to block your ears and say   No  no  I don't want to know  Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified. Don't tell me the answer.  A lot of people feel that way about consciousness  I've discovered. And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity  some understanding on you. You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks. But I'm not going to explain it all to you. I'm going to do what philosophers do. Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing the lady in half trick. You know the sawing the lady in half trick  The philosopher says   I'm going to explain to you how that's done. You see  the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half.   He merely makes you think that he does.  And you say   Yes  and how does he do that   He says   Oh  that's not my department  I'm sorry.  So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness. But I'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous    your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful    as you may have thought it is. This is something  by the way  that Lee Siegel talks about in his book. He marvels at how he'll do a magic show  and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X  Y  and Z. He never did those things. He didn't even try to do those things. People's memories inflate what they think they saw. And the same is true of consciousness. Now  let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this. Watch it carefully. I'm working with a young computer animator documentarian named Nick Deamer  and this is a little demo that he's done for me  part of a larger project some of you may be interested in. We're looking for a backer. It's a feature length documentary on consciousness. OK  now  you all saw what changed  right  How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color  Every one. I'll just show you by running it again. Even when you know that they're all going to change color  it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all. Now  this is an example    one of many    of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit. It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my      book   Consciousness Explained   where I said if you did experiments of this sort  you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes. If there's time at the end  I'll show you the much more dramatic case. Now  how can it be that there are all those changes going on  and that we're not aware of them  Well  earlier today  Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades  the way your eye moves around three or four times a second. He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion  moving around  looking at eyes  noses  elbows  looking at interesting things in the world. And where your eye isn't looking  you're remarkably impoverished in your vision. That's because the foveal part of your eye  which is the high resolution part  is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length. That's the detail part. It doesn't seem that way  does it  It doesn't seem that way  but that's the way it is. You're getting in a lot less information than you think. Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto. It's in the museum in North Carolina. Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's. And I love paintings like that    the painting is actually about as big as it is right here. And I love Canalettos  because Canaletto has this fantastic detail  and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting. And I started across the hall in North Carolina  because I thought it was probably a Canaletto  and would have all that in detail. And I noticed that on the bridge there  there's a lot of people    you can just barely see them walking across the bridge. And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people  see their clothes  and so forth. And as I got closer and closer  I actually screamed. I yelled out because when I got closer  I found the detail wasn't there at all. There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint. And as I walked towards the picture  I was expecting detail that wasn't there. The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things  and my brain had taken the suggestion. You're familiar with a more recent technology  which is    There  you can get a better view of the blobs. See  when you get close they're really just blobs of paint. You will have seen something like this    this is the reverse effect. I'll just give that to you one more time. Now  what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion  When an artful blob of paint or two  by an artist  suggests a person    say  one of Marvin Minsky's little society of mind    do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere  I don't think so. Not a chance. But then  how on Earth is it done  Well  remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady  It's the same thing. The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there. You think the detail's there  but it isn't there. The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all. It's just making you expect the detail. Let's just do this experiment very quickly. Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right  rotated  Yes. How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye  to see if it matched up with the one on the right  How many of you rotated the one on the right  OK. How do you know that's what you did  There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over    years in cognitive science    various experiments started by Roger Shepherd  who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images. Yes  it's possible to do that. But the details of the process are still in significant controversy. And if you read that literature  one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment  you don't know. You don't know how you do it. You just know that you have certain beliefs. And they come in a certain order  at a certain time. And what explains the fact that that's what you think  Well  that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician. This is a figure that I love  Bradley  Petrie  and Dumais. You may think that I've cheated  that I've put a little whiter than white boundary there. How many of you see that sort of boundary  with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles  Can you see it  Well  you know  in effect  the boundary's really there  in a certain sense. Your brain is actually computing that boundary  the boundary that goes right there. But now  notice there are two ways of seeing the cube  right  It's a Necker cube. Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube  OK. Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube  Because there's another way of seeing it. If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles  some black circles  there's another way of seeing it. As a cube  on a black background  as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese. Can you get it  How many of you can't get it  That'll help. Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena. When you see the cube one way  behind the screen  those boundaries go away. But there's still a sort of filling in  as we can tell if we look at this. We don't have any trouble seeing the cube  but where does the color change  Does your brain have to send little painters in there  The purple painters and the green painters fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain  No. Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in. When I first started talking about the Bradley  Petrie  Dumais example that you just saw    I'll go back to it  this one    I said that there was no filling in behind there. And I supposed that that was just a flat truth  always true. But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't. Now  if you think you see some pale yellow    I'll run this a few more times. Look in the gray areas  and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there    yeah  it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.   Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes  slide  This is Ron Rensink's work  which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book. Let me just pause this for a second if I can. This is change blindness. What you're going to see is two pictures  one of which is slightly different from the other. You see here the red roof and the gray roof  and in between them there will be a mask  which is just a blank screen  for about a quarter of a second. So you'll see the first picture  then a mask  then the second picture  then a mask. And this will just continue  and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change. So  show the original picture for     milliseconds. Blank. Show the next picture for     milliseconds. Blank. And keep going  until the subject presses the button  saying   I see the change.  So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment. We're going to start easy. Some examples. No trouble there. Can everybody see  All right. Indeed  Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button. Can you see that one   .  seconds. How many don't see it still  What's on the roof of that barn  It's easy. Is it a bridge or a dock  There are a few more really dramatic ones  and then I'll close. I want you to see a few that are particularly striking. This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see. Can you see it  Audience  Yes. Dan Dennett  See the shadows going back and forth  Pretty big. So   .  seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there. I love this one. I'll end with this one  just because it's such an obvious and important thing. How many still don't see it  How many still don't see it  How many engines on the wing of that Boeing  Right in the middle of the picture  Thanks very much for your attention. What I wanted to show you is that scientists  using their from the outside  third person methods  can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of  and that  in fact  you're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are. And we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind. Jeff Hawkins  this morning  was describing his attempt to get theory  and a good  big theory  into the neuroscience. And he's right. This is a problem. Harvard Medical School once    I was at a talk    director of the lab said   In our lab  we have a saying. If you work on one neuron  that's neuroscience. If you work on two neurons  that's psychology.  We have to have more theory  and it can come as much from the top down. Thank you very much. I'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning. But anyway  it's just great to see such a full theater  and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation.  Applause  One of the interesting things  of course  is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology  and of course what he said about listening to our young people. Of course  my job is all about listening  and my aim  really  is to teach the world to listen. That's my only real aim in life. And it sounds quite simple  but actually it's quite a big  big job. Because you know  when you look at a piece of music    for example  if I just open my little motorbike bag    we have here  hopefully  a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page. And  you know  we open it up and I read the music. So technically  I can actually read this. I will follow the instructions  the tempo markings  the dynamics. I will do exactly as I'm told. And so therefore  because time is short  if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so. It's very straightforward. There's nothing too difficult about the piece. But here I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick. I'm being told where to play on the drum. I'm being told which part of the stick to use. And I'm being told the dynamic. And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares. Snares on  snares off. So therefore  if I translate this piece of music  we have this idea.  Music  And so on. My career would probably last about five years. However  what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music. Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher  or to talk about  even  from a teacher. But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting  and that you want to explore through this tiny  tiny surface of a drum. So there  we experience the translation. Now we'll experience the interpretation.  Music   Applause  Now my career may last a little longer  But in a way  you know  it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on. I see that you're clutching a teddy bear  etc.  etc. So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about  what you might like  what you might do as a profession  etc.  etc. However  that's just  you know  the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look  and we try to interpret  but actually it's so unbelievably shallow. In the same way  I look at the music  I get a basic idea  I wonder what technically might be hard  or  you know  what I want to do. Just the basic feeling. However  that is simply not enough. And I think what Herbie said    please listen  listen. We have to listen to ourselves  first of all. If I play  for example  holding the stick    where literally I do not let go of the stick    you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm. And you feel really quite    believe it or not    detached from the instrument and from the stick  even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly. By holding it tightly  I feel strangely more detached. If I just simply let go and allow my hand  my arm  to be more of a support system  suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort. Much more. And I just feel  at last  one with the stick and one with the drum. And I'm doing far  far less. So in the same way that I need time with this instrument  I need time with people in order to interpret them. Not just translate them  but interpret them. If  for example  I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician    that is  someone who is basically a percussion player ...  Music  And so on. If I think of myself as a musician ...  Music  And so on. There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just     Applause     thinking about. And I remember when I was    years old  and I started playing tympani and percussion  and my teacher said   Well  how are we going to do this  You know  music is about listening.  And I said   Yes  I agree with that. So what's the problem   And he said   Well  how are you going to hear this  How are you going to hear that   And I said   Well  how do you hear it   He said   Well  I think I hear it through here.  And I said   Well  I think I do too    but I also hear it through my hands  through my arms  cheekbones  my scalp  my tummy  my chest  my legs and so on.  And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums    in particular  the kettle drums  or tympani    to such a narrow pitch interval  so something like ... that of a difference. Then gradually ... and gradually ... and it's amazing that when you do open your body up  and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through  that in fact the tiny  tiny difference ... can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger  there. And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room  and together we would  listen  to the sounds of the instruments  and really try to connect with those sounds far  far more broadly than simply depending on the ear. Because of course  the ear is  I mean  subject to all sorts of things. The room we happen to be in  the amplification  the quality of the instrument  the type of sticks ... etc.  etc. They're all different. Same amount of weight  but different sound colors. And that's basically what we are. We're just human beings  but we all have our own little sound colors  as it were  that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things. And as I grew older  I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London  and they said   Well  no  we won't accept you  because we haven't a clue  you know  of the future of a so called 'deaf' musician.  And I just couldn't quite accept that. And so therefore  I said to them   Well  look  if you refuse    if you refuse me through those reasons  as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound    then we have to think very  very hard about the people you do actually accept.  And as a result    once we got over a little hurdle  and having to audition twice    they accepted me. And not only that    what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom. Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms  no legs    they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand. No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry. And every single entry had to be listened to  experienced and then based on the musical ability    then that person could either enter or not. So therefore  this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions. And I have to say  many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world. The interesting thing about this as well  though    is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound    which is basically all of us  and we well know that music really is our daily medicine. I say  music   but actually I mean  sound.  Because you know  some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician  when you may have a    year old lad who has got the most incredible challenges  who may not be able to control his movements  who may be deaf  who may be blind  etc.  etc.    suddenly  if that young lad sits close to this instrument  and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba  and you play something that's so incredibly organ like  almost    I don't really have the right sticks  perhaps    but something like this. Let me change.  Music  Something that's so unbelievably simple    but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be  because I'm on top of the sound. I have the sound coming this way. He would have the sound coming through the resonators. If there were no resonators on here  we would have ...  Music  So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience  those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience either. Every single one of us  depending on where we're sitting  will experience this sound quite  quite differently. And of course  being the participator of the sound  and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce    for example  this sound. Can you hear anything  Exactly. Because I'm not even touching it. But yet  we get the sensation of something happening. In the same way that when I see tree moves  then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound. Do you see what I mean  Whatever the eye sees  then there's always sound happening. So there's always  always that huge    I mean  just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from. So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience  and not by learning a piece of music  putting on someone else's interpretation of it  buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music  and so on and so forth. Because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic  and something that I can fully experience the journey of. So it may be that  in certain halls  this dynamic may well work.  Music  It may be that in other halls  they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore  my level of soft  gentle playing may have to be ...  Music  Do you see what I mean  So  because of this explosion in access to sound  especially through the deaf community  this has not only affected how music institutions  how schools for the deaf treat sound    and not just as a means of therapy    although of course  being a participator of music  that definitely is the case as well. But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together. There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics  dare I say. But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine. The tiniest  softest  softest sound to something that is so broad  so huge  so incredible  There's always something    it may sound good up there  may not be so good there. May be great there  but terrible up there. Maybe terrible over there  but not too bad there  etc.  etc. So to find an actual hall is incredible    for which you can play exactly what you imagine  without it being cosmetically enhanced. And so therefore  acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired  and who are participators of sound. And this is quite interesting. I cannot  you know  give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls  but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we've been saying   Well  how on Earth can they experience music  You know  they're deaf.  We just    we go like that  and we imagine that that's what deafness is about. Or we go like that  and we imagine that's what blindness is about. If we see someone in a wheelchair  we assume they cannot walk. It may be that they can walk three  four  five steps. That  to them  means they can walk. In a year's time  it could be two extra steps. In another year's time  three extra steps. Those are hugely important aspects to think about. So when we do listen to each other  it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills  to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber  to stop the judgment. For me  as a musician who deals with    percent of new music  it's very easy for me to say   Oh yes  I like that piece. Oh no  I don't like that piece.  And so on. And you know  I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time. It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music  but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music. And you know  it's just one of the great things about being a musician  is that it is so unbelievably fluid. So there are no rules  no right  no wrong  this way  that way. If I asked you to clap    maybe I can do this. If I can just say   Please clap and create the sound of thunder.  I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder. Now  I don't mean just the sound  I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves. And please try to create that through your clapping. Try. Just    please try. Very good  Snow. Snow. Have you ever heard snow  Audience  No. Evelyn Glennie  Well then  stop clapping.  Laughter  Try again. Try again. Snow. See  you're awake. Rain. Not bad. Not bad. You know  the interesting thing here  though  is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question. Now    great imagination  thank you very much. However  not one of you got out of your seats to think   Right  How can I clap  OK  maybe ...  Claps  Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds. Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds.  Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands. In the same way that when we listen to music  we assume that it's all being fed through here. This is how we experience music. Of course it's not. We experience thunder    thunder  thunder. Think  think  think. Listen  listen  listen. Now    what can we do with thunder  I remember my teacher. When I first started  my very first lesson  I was all prepared with sticks  ready to go. And instead of him saying   OK  Evelyn  please  feet slightly apart  arms at a more or less    degree angle  sticks in a more or less V shape  keep this amount of space here  etc. Please keep your back straight  etc.  etc.  etc.     where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid  frozen  and I would not be able to strike the drum  because I was thinking of so many other things    he said   Evelyn  take this drum away for seven days  and I'll see you next week.  So  heavens  What was I to do  I no longer required the sticks  I wasn't allowed to have these sticks. I had to basically look at this particular drum  see how it was made  what these little lugs did  what the snares did. Turned it upside down  experimented with the shell  experimented with the head. Experimented with my body  experimented with jewelry  experimented with all sorts of things. And of course  I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that    but nevertheless  it was such an unbelievable experience  because then  where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music  Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book  So we never  ever dealt with actual study books. So for example  one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player  as opposed to a musician  is basically straightforward single stroke rolls. Like that. And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster. And so on and so forth. What does this piece require  Single stroke rolls. So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music  And that's exactly what he did. And interestingly  the older I became  and when I became a full time student at a so called  music institution   all of that went out of the window. We had to study from study books. And constantly  the question   Well  why  Why  What is this relating to  I need to play a piece of music.   Oh  well  this will help your control    Well  how  Why do I need to learn that  I need to relate it to a piece of music. You know. I need to say something.  Why am I practicing paradiddles  Is it just literally for control  for hand stick control  Why am I doing that  I need to have the reason  and the reason has to be by saying something through the music.  And by saying something through music  which basically is sound  we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people. But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage. That's up to you  when you walk through a hall. Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things. I may feel sorrowful  or happy  or exhilarated  or angry when I play certain pieces of music  but I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing. So please  the next time you go to a concert  just allow your body to open up  allow your body to be this resonating chamber. Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is. The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound  because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum  or the mallet on the bit of wood  or the bow on the string  etc.  or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass. They're experiencing that rawness there. But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure  which is before the sound is actually happening. Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike  or breath  is being pulled. Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference  rather than just arriving last night. But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses. But thank you very much for having me  In       with Rachel Carson's  Silent Spring   I think for people like me in the world of the making of things  the canary in the mine wasn't singing. And so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared. And the question was  were the birds singing  Now  I'm not a scientist  that'll be really clear. But  you know  we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be. What is a bird  Well  in my world  this is a rubber duck. It comes in California with a warning     This product contains chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.  This is a bird. What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children  I think we have a design problem. Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called  The Monticello Dialogues  on NPR  and sent me this as a thank you note     We realize that design is a signal of intention  but it also has to occur within a world  and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence  and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design  we  in a way  need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet  and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there  because the news is the news of abundance  and not the news of limits  and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear  we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent  driven by the sun  and start to imagine what that would be like to share.  That was a nice thing to get. That was one sentence. Henry James would be proud. This is    I put it down at the bottom  but that was extemporaneous  obviously. The fundamental issue is that  for me  design is the first signal of human intentions. So what are our intentions  and what would our intentions be    if we wake up in the morning  we have designs on the world    well  what would our intention be as a species now that we're the dominant species  And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate  because really  dominion is implicit in stewardship    because how could you dominate something you had killed  And stewardship's implicit in dominion  because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it. So the question is  what is the first question for designers  Now  as guardians    let's say the state  for example  which reserves the right to kill  the right to be duplicitous and so on    the question we're asking the guardian at this point is are we meant  how are we meant  to secure local societies  create world peace and save the environment  But I don't know that that's the common debate. Commerce  on the other hand  is relatively quick  essentially creative  highly effective and efficient  and fundamentally honest  because we can't exchange value for very long if we don't trust each other. So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work  but the question we bring to it is  how do we love all the children of all species for all time  And so we start our designs with that question. Because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy. If we come here and say   Well  I didn't intend to cause global warming on the way here   and we say   That's not part of my plan   then we realize it's part of our de facto plan. Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan. And I was at the White House for President Bush  meeting with every federal department and agency  and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan. If the end game is global warming  they're doing great. If the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act  then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as   Brain death for all children. No child left behind.  So  the question is  how many federal officials are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families  So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful  then you're just moving chess pieces around  if you don't know you're taking the king. So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change  which requires humility. And in my business as an architect  it's unfortunate the word  humility  and the word  architect  have not appeared in the same paragraph since  The Fountainhead.  So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility  reflect on this    it took us       years to put wheels on our luggage. So  as Kevin Kelly pointed out  there is no endgame. There is an infinite game  and we're playing in that infinite game. And so we call it  cradle to cradle   and our goal is very simple. This is what I presented to the White House. Our goal is a delightfully diverse  safe  healthy and just world  with clean air  clean water  soil and power    economically  equitably  ecologically and elegantly enjoyed  period. What don't you like about this  Which part of this don't you like  So we realized we want full diversity  even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said when asked what it was like to be President of France. He said   What do you think it's like trying to run a country with     kinds of cheese   But at the same time  we realize that our products are not safe and healthy. So we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million. This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of Alzheimer's later in life. We can ask ourselves  what is justice  and is justice blind  or is justice blindness  And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black  Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations. Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes. Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe  Clean soil is a critical problem    the nitrification  the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. A fundamental issue that's not being addressed. We've seen the first form of solar energy that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the Great Plains  and so that hegemony is leaving. And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC  they asked him   When will we see the end of the age of oil   I don't know if you remember his answer  but it was   The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.  We see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don't. We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect. This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles  sent to China. This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous  release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment  which is from copper. On the other hand  we see great signs of hope. Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India  who's figured out how to do mass produced health. He has given eyesight to two million people for free. We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings    bismuth  antimony  copper and so on. They become building steel. On the other hand  we're working with Berkshire Hathaway  Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet  the largest carpet company in the world. We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable  down to the parts per million. The upper is Nylon   that can go back to caprolactam  the bottom  a polyolephine    infinitely recyclable thermoplastic. Now if I was a bird  the building on my left is a liability. The building on my right  which is our corporate campus for The Gap with an ancient meadow  is an asset    its nesting grounds. Here's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong  with six million people in    square miles. During the dry season  we had four hours of water every fourth day. And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for    centuries. You can't farm the same piece of ground for    centuries without understanding nutrient flow. My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington  among the first growth and big growth. My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics  so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off. I went to Yale for graduate school  studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier  affectionately known in our business as Brutalism. If we look at the world of architecture  we see with Mies'      tower for Berlin  the question might be   Well  where's the sun   And this might have worked in Berlin  but we built it in Houston  and the windows are all closed. And with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use  this is actually a vertical gas chamber. When I went to Yale  we had the first energy crisis  and I was designing the first solar heated house in Ireland as a student  which I then built    which would give you a sense of my ambition. And Richard Meier  who was one of my teachers  kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism  and he would say   Bill  you've got to understand     solar energy has nothing to do with architecture.  I guess he didn't read Vitruvius. In       we did the first so called  green office  in America for Environmental Defense. We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials. They said   They're proprietary  they're legal  go away.  The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company  and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace. So  all of a sudden  here I am  graduating from high school in       and this happens  and we realize that  away  went away. Remember we used to throw things away  and we'd point to away  And yet  NOAA has now shown us  for example    you see that little blue thing above Hawaii  That's the Pacific Gyre. It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists  and they found six times as much plastic as plankton. When asked  they said   It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush.  Perhaps that's away. So we're looking for the design rules of this    this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world  Irian Jaya      species of tree  and we described this in the book   Cradle to Cradle.  The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree. That's the name of the first chapter     This Book is Not a Tree.  Because in poetics  as Margaret Atwood pointed out   we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears.  And with so much polymer  what we really need is technical nutrition  and to use something as elegant as a tree    imagine this design assignment  Design something that makes oxygen  sequesters carbon  fixes nitrogen  distills water  accrues solar energy as fuel  makes complex sugars and food  creates microclimates  changes colors with the seasons and self replicates. Well  why don't we knock that down and write on it  So  we're looking at the same criteria as most people    you know  can I afford it  Does it work  Do I like it  We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda  and I come from Charlottesville  where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson. We're adding life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now if we look at the word  competition   I'm sure most of you've used it. You know  most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere  which means strive together. It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other. They get fit together  and then they compete. The Williams sisters compete    one wins Wimbledon. So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together. And the Chinese government has now    I work with the Chinese government now    has taken this up. We're also looking at survival of the fittest  not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground  but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good. Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good  because  in our lexicon  asphalt is two words  assigning blame. But if we look at asphalt as our growth  then we realize that all we're doing is destroying the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system. So when we see E equals mc squared come along  from a poet's perspective  we see energy as physics  chemistry as mass  and all of a sudden  you get this biology. And we have plenty of energy  so we'll solve that problem  but the biology problem's tricky  because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge  we will never be able to recover that. And as Francis Crick pointed out  nine years after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson  that life itself has to have growth as a precondition    it has to have free energy  sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals. So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing  and we want growth  we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals. Then  the question becomes not growth or no growth  but what do you want to grow  So instead of just growing destruction  we want to grow the things that we might enjoy  and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese. So therefore  we have these two metabolisms  and I worked with a German chemist  Michael Braungart  and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms. The biological one I'm sure you understand  but also the technical one  where we take materials and put them into closed cycles. We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition. Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition. Biological nutrition can supply about     million humans  which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton  the world would run out of cork and dry up. So we need materials in closed cycles  but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer  birth defects  mutagenic effects  disruption of our immune systems  biodegradation  persistence  heavy metal content  knowledge of how we're making them and their production and so on. Our first product was a textile where we analyzed       chemicals in the textile industry. Using those intellectual filters  we eliminated       .  We were left with    chemicals. We have since databased the      most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing  and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks. So designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health. We've developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains  because when we asked most companies we work with    about a trillion dollars    and say   Where does your stuff come from   They say   Suppliers.   And where does it go    Customers.  So we need some help there. So the biological nutrients  the first fabrics    the water coming out was clean enough to drink. Technical nutrients    this is for Shaw Carpet  infinitely reusable carpet. Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet. Biotechnical nutrients    the Model U for Ford Motor  a cradle to cradle car    concept car. Shoes for Nike  where the uppers are polyesters  infinitely recyclable  the bottoms are biodegradable soles. Wear your old shoes in  your new shoes out. There is no finish line. The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever  some of the materials go back to soil    it's all solar powered. Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water. Here's a building for The Gap  where the ancient grasses of San Bruno  California  are on the roof. And this is our project for Ford Motor Company. It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn. This is obviously a color photograph. These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford. We saved Ford    million dollars doing it this way  day one  which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of an order for     million dollars worth of cars. Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof     and a half acres. This is the roof  saving money  and this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer. They showed up in five days. And we now have     pound auto workers learning bird songs on the Internet. We're developing now protocols for cities    that's the home of technical nutrients. The country    the home of biological. And putting them together. And so I will finish by showing you a new city we're designing for the Chinese government. We're doing    cities for China right now  based on cradle to cradle as templates. Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for     million people in    years. We did a mass energy balance    if they use brick  they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal. They'll have cities with no energy and no food. We signed a Memorandum of Understanding    here's Madam Deng Nan  Deng Xiaoping's daughter    for China to adopt cradle to cradle. Because if they toxify themselves  being the lowest cost producer  send it to the lowest cost distribution    Wal Mart    and then we send them all our money  what we'll discover is that we have what  effectively  when I was a student  was called mutually assured destruction. Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities. We're building a new city next to this city  look at that landscape. This is the site. We don't normally do green fields  but this one is about to be built  so they brought us in to intercede. This is their plan. It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape. And they brought us in and said   What would you do   This is what they would end up with  which is another color photograph. So this is the existing site  so this is what it looks like now  and here's our proposal. So the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully. We studied the biota  the ancient biota  the current farming and the protocols. We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air  fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day. We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure. We lay out the building areas. We start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be. The transportation is all very simple  everybody's within a five minute walk of mobility. We have a    hour street  so that there's always a place that's alive. The waste systems all connect. If you flush a toilet  your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants  which are sold as assets  not liabilities. Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas  The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations. And then it makes natural gas  which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city. So this is    these are fertilizer gas plants. And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city  where we've got farming  because what we've done is lifted up the city  the landscape  into the air to    to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings. The solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city. And this is the concept for the top of the city. We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs. The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next. We inhabit the city with work live space on all the ground floors. And so this is the existing city  and this is the new city. When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier. You're going to see some other speakers today  I already know  who are going to talk about breaking bones stuff  and  of course  with technology it never is. So it's very easy  comparatively speaking  to be resilient. I think that  if we look at what happened on the Internet  with such an incredible last half a dozen years  that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it. A lot of how we decide  how we're supposed to react to things and what we're supposed to expect about the future depends on how we bucket things and how we categorize them. And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush. It's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick. For one thing  both were very real. In       in that Gold Rush  they took over      million worth of gold out of California. It was very real. The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other. It's a big deal. Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust. You keep going  and both things are lots of hype. I don't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the Internet    like GetRich.com. But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush.  Gold. Gold. Gold.  Sixty eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal. Some have      . Many have more. A few bring out         dollars each. People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.  The Eldorado of the United States of America  the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California.  And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly. So many people left what they were doing. And what would happen is    and the Gold Rush went on for years. People on the East Coast in       when they first started to get the news  they thought   Ah  this isn't real.  But they keep hearing about people getting rich  and then in      they still hear that. And they think it's not real. By about       they're thinking   Am I the stupidest person on Earth by not rushing to California   And they start to decide they are. These are community affairs  by the way. Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams of        people would caravan across the United States  and they would form companies. These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what  if you were a lawyer or a banker  people dropped what they were doing  no matter what skill set they had  to go pan for gold. This guy on the left  Dr. Richard Beverley Cole  he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route. They would take a ship down to Panama  across the isthmus  and then take another ship north. This guy  Dr. Toland  went by covered wagon to California. This has its parallels  too. Doctors leaving their practices. These are both very successful    a physician in one case  a surgeon in the other. Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com. In the Gold Rush  people literally jumped ship. The San Francisco harbor was clogged with     ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold. So there were literally     captains and     ships. They turned the ships into hotels  because they couldn't sail them anywhere. You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever. And you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened. The fort in San Francisco at the time had about       soldiers. Half of them deserted to go look for gold. And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back. And one of the soldiers wrote home  and this is the sentence that he put   The struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and    dollars a day is a rather severe one.  They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate. This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail. They loaded up their mules and their horses. And they didn't plan right. And they didn't know how far they would really have to go  and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff. In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going. It got renamed the  Dead Horse Trail.  And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time   Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way  sometimes in bunches under the cliffs  with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above  sometimes in tangled masses  filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march  often  I regret to say  exhausted  but still alive  a fact we were unaware of  until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade. The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road. The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to  the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone  cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described.  And you know  without the smell that would have accompanied that  we had the same thing on the Internet  very bad burn rate calculations. I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it. This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year     . Bride     Then why does she have my invitation  Announcer  What may be a little thing to some ... Bride     You are mine  little man. Announcer  Could be a really big deal to you. Husband     Is that your wife  Husband     Not for another    minutes. Announcer  After all  it's your special day. OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world. Jeff Bezos  It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for. But they spent three and a half million dollars in the      Super Bowl to air that ad  even though  at the time  they only had a million dollars in annual revenue. Now  here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge  and I think rather severely. And that is  in a gold rush  when it's over  it's over. Here's this guy   There are many men in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed. They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip  risked life  health and property  spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them.  And that was  of course  the very common story. Because when you take out that last piece of gold    and they did incredibly quickly. I mean  if you look at the      Gold Rush    the entire American river region  within two years    every stone had been turned. And after that  only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there. So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry. And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry. With the electric industry you actually have to    one of them is that they're both sort of thin  horizontal  enabling layers that go across lots of different industries. It's not a specific thing. But electricity is also very  very broad  so you have to sort of narrow it down. You know  it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power. It's an incredible means of coordinating  in a very fine grained way  information flows. There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity. And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances. The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about    they weren't putting electricity into the home  they were putting lighting into the home. And  but it really    it got the electricity. It took a long time. This was a huge    as you would expect    a huge capital build out. All the streets had to be torn up. This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations. And they're tearing up all the streets. The Edison Electric Company  which became Edison General Electric  which became General Electric  paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive. But that is not the    and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web. Because  remember  the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long distance phone network. So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure    I'm going back now to  sort of  the explosive part of the Web in       when it was growing       percent a year. How could it grow at       percent a year in      when people weren't really investing in the Web  Well  it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down. So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure  and then home appliances started coming into being. And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan    this was the      electric fan. And the appliances  the golden age of appliances really lasted    it depends how you want to measure it    but it's anywhere from    to    years. It goes on a long time. It starts about     . And the electric fan was a big success. The electric iron  also very big. By the way  this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit. There's asbestos under that handle there. This is the first vacuum cleaner  the      Skinner Vacuum  from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed    pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car. So it wasn't a big seller. This was truly  truly an early adopter product    the      Skinner Vacuum. But three years later  by       it weighed    pounds. Now  not all these things were highly successful. This is the electric tie press  which never really did catch on. People  I guess  decided that they would not wrinkle their ties. These never really caught on either  the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller. This came in  like  six different colors. I don't know why. But I thought  you know  sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention  maybe it's time to give this one another shot. So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this. We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really    I thought that would really work  to give that another shot. Now  the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires  and it took a lot of time and attention. I want to point out one thing. This is    you guys know what this is. They hadn't invented the electric socket yet. So this was    remember  they didn't wire the houses for electricity. They wired them for lighting. So your    your appliances would plug in. They would    each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top. And you'd plug it in there. In fact  if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World  you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture. All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance. The next thing that really was a big  big deal was the washing machine. Now  this was an object of much envy and lust. Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines. On the left hand side  this was the soapy water. And there's a rotor there    that this motor is spinning. And it would clean your clothes. This is the clean rinse water. So you'd take the clothes out of here  put them in here  and then you'd run the clothes through this electric ringer. And this was a big deal. You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain. And you'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket. And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation  because they hadn't invented the off switch. That was to come much later    the off switch on appliances    because it didn't make any sense. I mean  you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket. So you know  when you were done with it  you unscrewed it. That's what you did. You didn't turn it off. And as I said before  they hadn't invented the electric outlet either  so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device. And there are    when you research this  there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices. And they couldn't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house. And there was no off switch  so it wasn't very good. And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this. But  you know  before I get too far into condemning our ancestors  I thought I'd show you  this is my conference room. This is a total kludge  if you ask me. First of all  this got installed upside down. This light socket    and so the cord keeps falling out  so I taped it in. This is supposed    don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one. This is what it looks like under my desk. I took this picture just two days ago. So we really haven't progressed that much since     . It's a total  total mess. And  you know  we think it's getting better  but have you tried to install    .   yourself  I challenge you to try. It's very hard. I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science    this process has brought them to tears  absolute tears.  Laughter  And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house. Try to get DSL installed in your house. The engineers who do it everyday can't do it. They have to    typically  they come three times. And one friend of mine was telling me a story  not only did they get there and have to wait  but then the engineers  when they finally did get there  for the third time  they had to call somebody. And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there. So we're not    we're pretty kludge y ourselves. By the way  DSL is a kludge. I mean  this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it's being put to    you know it's the whole thing    we're very  very primitive. And that's kind of the point. Because  you know  resilience    if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush  then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone. But the good thing is  with innovation  there isn't a last nugget. Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities. And if you believe that  then you believe that where we are    this is what I think    I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge    and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web    but there's so much kludge  so much terrible stuff    we are at the      Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet. That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it  but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are. We're in     . And if you believe that  then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is        All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble.         Amazon.toast.  In        Amazon.bomb.  My mom hates this picture. She    but you know  if you really do believe that it's the very  very beginning  if you believe it's the      Hurley washing machine  then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are. And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us. And in       Sears    I want to get this exactly right. This was the advertisement that they ran in     . It says   Use your electricity for more than light.  And I think that's where we are. We're very  very early. Thank you very much. Mockingbirds are badass. They are. Mockingbirds    that's Mimus polyglottos    are the emcees of the animal kingdom. They listen and mimic and remix what they like. They rock the mic outside my window every morning. I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms like they were songs of spring. I mean  if you can talk it  a mockingbird can squawk it. So check it  I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds. I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails. Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood  say  where people got a lotta  I'll take a mockingbird I caught in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go  you know. Up goes the bird  out come the words   Juanito  Juanito  vente a comer mi hijo   Oh  I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound. Cruising random city streets  rocking a drop top Cadillac with a big backseat  packing like    brown paper Walmart bags full of loaded mockingbirds  and I'll get everybody. I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying   We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis.  I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is. I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is. I'll get your postman making dinner plans. I'll get the last time you lied. I'll get   Baby  just give me the frickin' TV guide.  I'll get a lonely  little sentence with real error in it   Yeah  I guess I could come inside  but only for a minute.  I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning  It's Raining  It's Pouring.  I'll put a mockingbird on a late night train just to get an old man snoring. I'll get your ex lover telling someone else   Good morning.  I'll get everyone's good mornings. I don't care how you make 'em. Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah Salam Alaikum. Everybody means everybody  means everybody here. And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage. I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages. Inside it  I will place a mockingbird for    short explanation  hippie parents. What does a violin have to do with technology  Where in the world is this world heading  On one end  gold bars    on the other  an entire planet. We are    billion light years from the edge. That's a guess. Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely  but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America because countries are beginning to eat like us  live like us and die like us. You might wanna avert your gaze  because that is a newt about to regenerate its limb  and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing. There's about    million phage per job. It's a very strange world inside a nanotube. Women can talk  black men ski  white men build strong buildings  we build strong suns. The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes  and here we are  right in the middle. It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn. When all the little mockingbirds fly away  they're going to sound like the last four days. I will get uptown gurus  downtown teachers  broke ass artists and dealers  and Filipino preachers  leaf blowers  bartenders  boob job doctors  hooligans  garbage men  your local Congressmen in the spotlight  guys in the overhead helicopters. Everybody gets heard. Everybody gets this one  honest mockingbird as a witness. And I'm on this. I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads  with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing   Hush  little baby  don't say a word. Wait for the man with the mockingbird.  Yeah. And then come the news crews  and the man in the street interviews  and the letters to the editor. Everybody asking  just who is responsible for this citywide  nationwide mockingbird cacophony  and somebody finally is going to tip the City Council of Monterey  California off to me  and they'll offer me a key to the city. A gold plated  oversized key to the city and that is all I need  'cause if I get that  I can unlock the air. I'll listen for what's missing  and I'll put it there. Thank you  TED. Chris Anderson  Wow. Wow. I am a vicar in the Church of England. I've been a priest in the Church for    years. For most of that time  I've been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of God. Who is God  And I'm very aware that when you say the word  God   many people will turn off immediately. And most people  both within and outside the organized church  still have a picture of a celestial controller  a rule maker  a policeman in the sky who orders everything  and causes everything to happen. He will protect his own people  and answer the prayers of the faithful. And in the worship of my church  the most frequently used adjective about God is  almighty.  But I have a problem with that. I have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of God over the years. Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years  Of course  there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at God. Exploring the feminine  nurturing side of divinity. Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness  rather than power. Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition. Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning. These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles  but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them  for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities  for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers. I have chosen not to rock the boat. Then  on December   th last year  just two months ago  that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami. And two weeks later  Sunday morning   th of January  I found myself standing in front of my congregation    intelligent  well meaning  mostly thoughtful Christian people    and I needed to express  on their behalf  our feelings and our questions. I had my own personal responses  but I also have a public role  and something needed to be said. And this is what I said. Shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article written by the Archbishop of Canterbury    fine title    about the tragedy in Southern Asia. The essence of what he said was this  the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen. He wrote   If some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense  would we feel happier  or safer  or more confident in God   If the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers  holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now  there are no words that we could say to him. A verbal response would not be appropriate. The only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help. It isn't a time for explanation  or preaching  or theology  it's a time for tears. This is true. And yet here we are  my church in Oxford  semi detached from events that happened a long way away  but with our faith bruised. And we want an explanation from God. We demand an explanation from God. Some have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain. In some way  God must feel the anguish  and grief  and physical pain that we feel. In some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within. And if this is true  it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit  as well. We want a God who can weep with those who weep  and rejoice with those who rejoice. This seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re statement of Christian belief about God. For hundreds of years  the prevailing orthodoxy  the accepted truth  was that God the Father  the Creator  is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness. Now the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me. And the devastating events of the   th century have forced people to question the cold  unfeeling God. The slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask   Where is God in all this  Who is God in all this   And the answer was   God is in this with us  or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore.  If God is a bystander  observing but not involved  then God may well exist  but we don't want to know about Him. Many Jews and Christians now feel like this  I know. And I am among them. So we have a suffering God    a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul. I very much relate to this idea of God. But it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions  and I hope they are questions that you will want to ask  as well  some of you. Over the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate  a bit dodgy. We have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre school children. And last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs   The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock.  Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this   The foolish man built his house upon the sand   And the floods came up   And the house on the sand went crash.  Then in the same week  at a funeral  we sang the familiar hymn  We Plow the Fields and Scatter   a very English hymn. In the second verse comes the line   The wind and waves obey Him.  Do they  I don't feel we can sing that song again in church  after what's happened. So the first big question is about control. Does God have a plan for each of us  Is God in control  Does God order each moment  Does the wind and the waves obey Him  From time to time  one hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them  so that everything worked out all right    some difficulty overcome  some illness cured  some trouble averted  a parking space found at a crucial time. I can remember someone saying this to me  with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of God. But if God can or will do these things    intervene to change the flow of events    then surely he could have stopped the tsunami. Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces  but not big things like     mile per hour waves  That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians  and we must acknowledge it. Either God is responsible for the tsunami  or God is not in control. After the tragedy  survival stories began to emerge. You probably heard some of them  the man who surfed the wave  the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school. Then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore to hold a service in the hills. The preacher delivered an extra long sermon  so that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck. Afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them. So the next question is about partiality. Can we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him  Does God demand loyalty  like any medieval tyrant  A God who looks after His own  so that Christians are OK  while everyone else perishes  A cosmic us and them  and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism  That would be appalling  and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership. Such a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity. So who is God  if not the great puppet master or the tribal protector  Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen  so that heroism and compassion can be shown. Perhaps God is testing us  testing our charity  or our faith. Perhaps there is a great  cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out OK in the end. Perhaps  but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything  the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign. We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz. In his great novel   The Brothers Karamazov   Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan  addressed to his naive and devout younger brother  Alyosha   If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth  then I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price. We cannot afford to pay so much for admission. It is not God that I do not accept. I merely  most respectfully  return Him the ticket.  Or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever  so that natural processes could occur  and evolution run its course. This seems more acceptable  but it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility. Is God a cold  unfeeling spectator  Or a powerless lover  watching with infinite compassion things God is unable to control or change  Is God intimately involved in our suffering  so that He feels it in His own being  If we believe something like this  we must let go of the puppet master completely  take our leave of the almighty controller  abandon traditional models. We must think again about God. Maybe God doesn't do things at all. Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents. Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person  doing things all over the place. Beating up the Egyptians  drowning them in the Red Sea  wasting cities  getting angry. The people knew their God by His mighty acts. But what if God doesn't act  What if God doesn't do things at all  What if God is in things  The loving soul of the universe. An in dwelling compassionate presence  underpinning and sustaining all things. What if God is in things  In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life. In the natural cycle of life and death  the creation and destruction that must happen continuously. In the process of evolution. In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world. In the collective unconscious  the soul of the human race. In you  in me  mind and body and spirit. In the tsunami  in the victims. In the depth of things. In presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity. In change and development and growth. How does this in ness  this innerness  this interiority of God work  It's hard to conceive  and begs more questions. Is God just another name for the universe  with no independent existence at all  I don't know. To what extent can we ascribe personality to God  I don't know. In the end  we have to say   I don't know.  If we knew  God would not be God. To have faith in this God would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe  and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements. Isn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe in an infinite  unknowable being then tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines  How could one practice such a faith  By seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness. In silence  in meditation  in my inner space  in the me that remains when I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations. In awareness of the inner conversation. And how would we live such a faith  How would I live such a faith  By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness. The kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep. If God is in all people  then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a three way encounter. There is an Indian greeting  which I'm sure some of you know   Namaste   accompanied by a respectful bow  which  roughly translated means   That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you.  Namaste. And how would one deepen such a faith  By seeking the inwardness which is in all things. In music and poetry  in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life  there is a deep  indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary. It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting  a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own. When I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami  I had no answers to offer them. No neat packages of faith  with Bible references to prove them. Only doubts and questioning and uncertainty. I had some suggestions to make    possible new ways of thinking about God. Ways that might allow us to go on  down a new and uncharted road. But in the end  the only thing I could say for sure was   I don't know   and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all. Thank you. That splendid music  the coming in music   The Elephant March  from  Aida   is the music I've chosen for my funeral. And you can see why. It's triumphal. I won't feel anything  but if I could  I would feel triumphal at having lived at all  and at having lived on this splendid planet  and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why I was here in the first place  before not being here. Can you understand my quaint English accent  Like everybody else  I was entranced yesterday by the animal session. Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others  the beauty of the things that they showed. The only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang   the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth.  Now of course  we know that he didn't really mean that  but in this country at the moment  you can't be too careful. I'm a biologist  and the central theorem of our subject  the theory of design  Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In professional circles everywhere  it's of course universally accepted. In non professional circles outside America  it's largely ignored. But in non professional circles within America  it arouses so much hostility    it's fair to say that American biologists are in a state of war. The war is so worrying at present  with court cases coming up in one state after another  that I felt I had to say something about it. If you want to know what I have to say about Darwinism itself  I'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books  which you won't find in the bookstore outside. Contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism  called  Intelligent Design   or ID. Don't be fooled. There's nothing new about ID. It's just creationism under another name  rechristened    I choose the word advisedly    for tactical  political reasons. The arguments of so called ID theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again  since Darwin down to the present day. There is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science  and I try to do all I can to help them  but they get quite upset when people like me dare to mention that we happen to be atheists as well as evolutionists. They see us as rocking the boat  and you can understand why. Creationists  lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case  fall back on the popular phobia against atheism  Teach your children evolution in biology class  and they'll soon move on to drugs  grand larceny and sexual  pre version.  In fact  of course  educated theologians from the Pope down are firm in their support of evolution. This book   Finding Darwin's God   by Kenneth Miller  is one of the most effective attacks on Intelligent Design that I know and it's all the more effective because it's written by a devout Christian. People like Kenneth Miller could be called a  godsend  to the evolution lobby  because they expose the lie that evolutionism is  as a matter of fact  tantamount to atheism. People like me  on the other hand  rock the boat. But here  I want to say something nice about creationists. It's not a thing I often do  so listen carefully. I think they're right about one thing. I think they're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion. I've already said that many individual evolutionists  like the Pope  are also religious  but I think they're deluding themselves. I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith. Now  it may sound as though I'm about to preach atheism  and I want to reassure you that that's not what I'm going to do. In an audience as sophisticated as this one  that would be preaching to the choir. No  what I want to urge upon you    Instead  what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism. But that's putting it too negatively. If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith  I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science  and indeed science generally  but evolution in particular  to inspire and enthrall  precisely because it is atheistic. Now  the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things. Statistical improbability in the direction of good design     complexity  is another word for this. The standard creationist argument    there is only one  they're all reduced to this one    takes off from a statistical improbability. Living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance  therefore  they must have had a designer. This argument of course  shoots itself in the foot. Any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself  and that's before we even start on the other things he's expected to do  like forgive sins  bless marriages  listen to prayers    favor our side in a war    disapprove of our sex lives  and so on. Complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve  and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex  thereby simply compounding the problem. Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity. Essentially  it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual  step by step increment. But here  I only want to make the point that the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion  precisely because it is so elegant  so parsimonious  so powerful  so economically powerful. It has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge. The God theory is not just a bad theory. It turns out to be    in principle    incapable of doing the job required of it. So  returning to tactics and the evolution lobby  I want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do. My approach to attacking creationism is    unlike the evolution lobby    my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole. And at this point I need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion  and I'm going to do so in the words of the late Douglas Adams  a dear friend who  if he never came to TED  certainly should have been invited. Richard Dawkins  He was. Good. I thought he must have been. He begins this speech  which was tape recorded in Cambridge shortly before he died    he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof  and then he goes on. I quote   Religion doesn't seem to work like that. It has certain ideas at the heart of it  which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.' What it means is  here is an idea or a notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about. You're just not. Why not  Because you're not.   Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the Republicans or Democrats  this model of economics versus that  Macintosh instead of Windows  but to have an opinion about how the universe began  about who created the universe    no  that's holy. So  we're used to not challenging religious ideas  and it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates when he does it.     He meant me  not that one.  Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it  because you're not allowed to say these things. Yet when you look at it rationally  there's no reason why those ideas shouldn't be as open to debate as any other  except that we've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn't be.  And that's the end of the quote from Douglas. In my view  not only is science corrosive to religion  religion is corrosive to science. It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial  supernatural non explanations  and blinds them to the wonderful  real explanations that we have within our grasp. It teaches them to accept authority  revelation and faith  instead of always insisting on evidence. There's Douglas Adams  magnificent picture from his book   Last Chance to See.  Now  there's a typical scientific journal  The Quarterly Review of Biology. And I'm going to put together  as guest editor  a special issue on the question   Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs   And the first paper is a standard scientific paper  presenting evidence   Iridium layer at the K T boundary  and potassium argon dated crater in Yucatan  indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.  Perfectly ordinary scientific paper. Now  the next one.  The President of the Royal Society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.   It has been privately revealed to Professor Huxtane that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.   Professor Hordley was brought up to have total and unquestioning faith      that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.   Professor Hawkins has promulgated an official dogma binding on all loyal Hawkinsians that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.  That's inconceivable  of course. But suppose     Supporters of the Asteroid Theory cannot be patriotic citizens  In       a reporter asked George Bush  Sr. whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists. Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.  No  I don't know that atheists should be considered citizens  nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God.  Bush's bigotry was not an isolated mistake  blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted. He stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal. He really meant it. More to the point  he knew it posed no threat to his election    quite the contrary. Democrats as well as Republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected. Both parties invoke  one nation under God.  What would Thomas Jefferson have said   In every country and in every age  the priest has been hostile to liberty  Incidentally  I'm not usually very proud of being British  but you can't help making the comparison. In practice  what is an atheist  An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf. As has been said before  we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further. And however we define atheism  it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic  unelectable non citizen. Nevertheless  it's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub. And that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird  way out minority. Natalie Angier wrote a rather sad piece in the New Yorker  saying how lonely she felt as an atheist. She clearly feels in a beleaguered minority. But actually  how do American atheists stack up numerically  The latest survey makes surprisingly encouraging reading. Christianity  of course  takes a massive lion's share of the population  with nearly     million. But what would you think was the second largest group  convincingly outnumbering Jews with  .  million  Muslims at  .  million  Hindus  Buddhists and all other religions put together  The second largest group  with nearly    million  is the one described as non religious or secular. You can't help wondering why vote seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of  for example  the Jewish lobby    the state of Israel seems to owe its very existence to the American Jewish vote    while at the same time  consigning the non religious to political oblivion. This secular non religious vote  if properly mobilized  is nine times as numerous as the Jewish vote. Why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle  Well  so much for quantity. How about quality  Is there any correlation  positive or negative  between intelligence and tendency to be religious   Them folks misunderestimated me  The survey that I quoted  which is the ARIS survey  didn't break down its data by socio economic class or education  IQ or anything else. But a recent article by Paul G. Bell in the Mensa magazine provides some straws in the wind. Mensa  as you know  is an international organization for people with very high IQ. And from a meta analysis of the literature  Bell concludes that  I quote     Of    studies carried out since      on the relationship between religious belief  and one's intelligence or educational level  all but four found an inverse connection. That is  the higher one's intelligence or educational level  the less one is likely to be religious.  Well  I haven't seen the original    studies  and I can't comment on that meta analysis  but I would like to see more studies done along those lines. And I know that there are    if I could put a little plug here    there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question  and I put the suggestion up  for what it's worth. But let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed  on one special group    namely  top scientists. In       Larson and Witham polled the cream of American scientists  those who'd been honored by election to the National Academy of Sciences  and among this select group  belief in a personal God dropped to a shattering seven percent. About    percent are agnostic  the rest could fairly be called atheists. Similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality. Among biological scientists  the figure is even lower   .  percent  only  believe in God. Physical scientists  it's  .  percent. I've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields  such as history or philosophy  but I'd be surprised if they were different. So  we've reached a truly remarkable situation  a grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia and the American electorate. A philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe  which is held by the vast majority of top American scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally  is so abhorrent to the American electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public. If I'm right  this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it    the intelligentsia    unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs. To put it bluntly  American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest. I'm not a citizen of this country  so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming if I suggest that something needs to be done. And I've already hinted what that something is. From what I've seen of TED  I think this may be the ideal place to launch it. Again  I fear it will cost money. We need a consciousness raising  coming out campaign for American atheists. This could be similar to the campaign organized by homosexuals a few years ago  although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will. In most cases  people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists. On the contrary  they'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people who could serve as decent role models for your children  the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product  the kinds of people who are sitting in this room. There should be a snowball effect  a positive feedback  such that the more names we have  the more we get. There could be non linearities  threshold effects. When a critical mass has been obtained  there's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment. And again  it will need money. I suspect that the word  atheist  itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means  and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves. So  what other words might be used to smooth the path  oil the wheels  sugar the pill  Darwin himself preferred  agnostic     and not only out of loyalty to his friend Huxley  who coined the term. Darwin said   I have never been an atheist in the same sense of denying the existence of a God. I think that generally an 'agnostic' would be the most correct description of my state of mind.  He even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling. Aveling was a militant atheist who failed to persuade Darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism    incidentally  giving rise to a fascinating myth that Karl Marx tried to dedicate  Das Kapital  to Darwin  which he didn't  it was actually Edward Aveling. What happened was that Aveling's mistress was Marx's daughter  and when both Darwin and Marx were dead  Marx's papers became muddled up with Aveling's papers  and a letter from Darwin saying   My dear sir  thank you very much but I don't want you to dedicate your book to me   was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx  and that gave rise to this whole myth  which you've probably heard. It's a sort of urban myth  that Marx tried to dedicate  Kapital  to Darwin. Anyway  it was Aveling  and when they met  Darwin challenged Aveling.  Why do you call yourselves atheists    'Agnostic  '  retorted Aveling   was simply 'atheist' writ respectable  and 'atheist' was simply 'agnostic' writ aggressive.  Darwin complained   But why should you be so aggressive   Darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia  but that ordinary people were not  quote   ripe for it.  Which is  of course  our old friend  the  don't rock the boat  argument. It's not recorded whether Aveling told Darwin to come down off his high horse. But in any case  that was more than     years ago. You'd think we might have grown up since then. Now  a friend  an intelligent lapsed Jew  who  incidentally  observes the Sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity  describes himself as a  tooth fairy agnostic.  He won't call himself an atheist because it's  in principle  impossible to prove a negative  but  agnostic  on its own might suggest that God's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non existence. So  my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy  but it isn't very likely  is it  Like God. Hence the phrase   tooth fairy agnostic.  Bertrand Russell made the same point using a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars. You would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars  but that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non existence. The list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots  it's infinite. If you want to believe one particular one of them    unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or Yahweh    the onus is on you to say why. The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not. We  who are atheists  are also a fairyists and a teapotists. But we don't bother to say so. And this is why my friend uses  tooth fairy agnostic  as a label for what most people would call atheist. Nonetheless  if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly  we're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than  tooth fairy  or  teapot agnostic.  So  how about  humanist   This has the advantage of a worldwide network of well organized associations and journals and things already in place. My problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism. One of the things we've learned from Darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins  some close  some distant. And there are other possibilities  like  naturalist   but that also has problems of confusion  because Darwin would have thought naturalist     Naturalist  means  of course  as opposed to  supernaturalist     and it is used sometimes    Darwin would have been confused by the other sense of  naturalist   which he was  of course  and I suppose there might be others who would confuse it with  nudism . Such people might be those belonging to the British lynch mob  which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile. I think the best of the available alternatives for  atheist  is simply  non theist.  It lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no God  and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics. It's completely compatible with the God of the physicists. When atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word  God   they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep  mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand.  Non theist  will do for all that  yet unlike  atheist   it doesn't have the same phobic  hysterical responses. But I think  actually  the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word  atheism  itself  precisely because it is a taboo word  carrying frissons of hysterical phobia. Critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word  atheist  than with the word  non theist   or some other non confrontational word. But if we did achieve it with that dread word  atheist  itself  the political impact would be even greater. Now  I said that if I were religious  I'd be very afraid of evolution    I'd go further  I would fear science in general  if properly understood. And this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting  more poetic  more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty stricken arsenals of the religious imagination. As Carl Sagan  another recently dead hero  put it   How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded  'This is better than we thought  The universe is much bigger than our prophet said  grander  more subtle  more elegant'  Instead they say  'No  no  no  My god is a little god  and I want him to stay that way.' A religion  old or new  that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science  might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.  Now  this is an elite audience  and I would therefore expect about    percent of you to be religious. Many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief that we should respect religion. But I also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as I do. If you're one of them  and of course many of you may not be  but if you are one of them  I'm asking you to stop being polite  come out  and say so. And if you happen to be rich  give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference. The religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations    to say nothing of all the tax benefits    by foundations  such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute. We need an anti Templeton to step forward. If my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books  instead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books  I'd do it myself. People are always going on about   How did September the   th change you   Well  here's how it changed me. Let's all stop being so damned respectful. Thank you very much. I just want to say  over the last few years I've been    had the opportunity to do this closing conference. And I've had some incredible warm up acts. About eight years ago  Billy Graham opened for me. And I thought that there was    I thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that. But I just wanted to say    and I mean this without irony    I think I can speak for everybody in the audience when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States. OK  this is the title of my talk today. I just want to give you a quick overview. First of all  please remember I'm completely politically correct  and I mean everything with great affection. If any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy  now is the time to check your Blackberry. Just to review  this is my TEDTalk. We're going to do some jokes  some gags  some little skits    and then we're going to talk about the L  point. So  one of the questions I ask myself is  was this the most distressing TED ever  Let's try and sum things up  shall we  Images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox     percent of the conference. Mentions of polar bears drowning  four percent. Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu     percent. And David Pogue singing show tunes. Because this is the most distressing TED ever  I've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag. And if the    if the conference is anywhere near this distressing  then we're going to have a scream bag next year. It's going to be a cradle to cradle scream bag  of course. So you're going to be able to go like this. Bring it over here and open it up. Aaaah  Meanwhile  back at TED University  this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips. So Robert Wright    I don't know  I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to  it might have been him. I want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels. He was talking about morality. Economy class morality is  we want to bomb you back to the Stone Age. Business class morality is  don't bomb Japan    they built my car. And first class morality is  don't bomb Mexico    they clean my house. Yes  it is politically incorrect. All right  now I want to do a little bit of a thing for you ... All right  now these are the wha    I'd say   mumble  mumble    mumble  mumble  mumble  mumble  mumble     ahh  So I wanted to show you guys    I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you    as a completely natural user interface. And you can    you can use really natural hand gestures to like  go like this. Now we had a Harvard professor here    she was from Harvard  I just wanted to mention and    and she was actually a professor from Harvard. And she was talking about seven dimensional  inverted universes. With  you know  of course  there's the gravity brain. There's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain  which is too    too    absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about. Now    one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for. And that's why I went out and I picked up a best selling business book. You know  it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology. And it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren  and it's called  The Porpoise Driven Life.  And Rick is as a pagan god  which I thought was kind of appropriate  in a certain way. And now we're going to have kind of a little more visualization about Rick Warren. OK. All right. Now  red is Rick Warren  and green is Daniel Dennett  OK  The scales here are religiosity from zero percent  or atheist  to     percent  Bible literally true. And then this is books sold    the logarithmic scale.                  three million     million      million. OK  now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out. And Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead  kind of pulling ahead. Yup  and his installed base is getting a little bigger. But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back. Let me turn the trails on  so you can see that a little bit better. Now  one of the things that's very important is  Nicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per    I'm sorry    about One Laptop Per Child. Now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device. I'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters  and then I'll show it to you in person. First of all  it needs to be small. It needs to be flat  so it's transportable. Lightweight. Portable. Uses very  very little power. Very  very high resolution. Has to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere. And broadly applicable across many platforms. Now  we've actually done some research    Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market. They did some research  we came back  and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually asking for. And here it is  the      computer. OK  OK  OK  OK    excellent  excellent. Now  I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about     bucks. And he and his team of junior high school students were doing real science. So we're trying to check and trying to douse here  and see who uses marijuana. See who uses marijuana. Are we going to be able to find any marijuana  Jim Young  Only if we open enough locker doors. OK  now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness. We had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox. I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox. We start. This is day one. Day two. Day three  she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder. Day three. Day four. Day five and day six. Now the good news is  because I'm a trained medical professional  I know that even though she'll be scarred for life  she's going to make a full recovery. Now the good news about Architects for Humanity is they're really kind of the most amazing group. They've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions  clinic solutions  in Africa  and they've had a design competition. Now the wonderful thing is  Larry Brilliant was just appointed the head of the Google Foundation  and so he decided that he would support    he would support Cameron's work. And the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over        shipping containers of Google snacks. So I want to show you some prototypes. The U.N.    you know  they took    years just to add a flap to a tent  but I think we have some more exciting things. This is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll Ups. And those roll up cookies coated with white chocolate. And the really wonderful thing about this is  when you're done  well    you can eat it. But the thing that I'm really  really excited about is this incredible granola house. And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof to collect water and recycle it. And it's    well  on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids and Gummy Bears to let in the light. But on this side  it has sugary Gummy Bears  to diffuse the light more slightly. And we    we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ. So  Einstein    Einstein  tell me    what's your favorite song  No  I said what's your favorite song  No  I said what's your favorite song   Free Bird.  OK  so  Einstein  what's your favorite singing group  Could you say that again  What's your favorite singing group  OK  one more time    I'm just going to give you a little help. Your favorite singing group    it's Diana Ross and the    Audience  Supremes  Tom Reilly  Exactly. Could we have the sound up on the laptop  please   Free Bird  kind of reminds me that if you    if you listen to  Free Bird  backwards  this is what you might hear. Computer  Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. TR  Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message  so I wanted to    so I wanted to help you a little bit. Computer  My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan. Buy  The Purpose Driven Life   or Satan will take your soul. TR  So  we've talked a lot about global warming  but  you know  as Jill said  it sounds kind of nice    good weather in the wintertime  and New York City. And as Jay Walker pointed out  that is just not scary enough. So Al  I actually think I'm rather good at branding. So I've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace  global warming.  So we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming. And then we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch    into  Het globale Verwarmen.  From Dutch to  Korean   into  Hordahordaneecheewa.   Korean  to Portuguese  Aquecer se Global. Then Portuguese to Pig Latin. Aquecer se ucked fay. And then finally back into the English  which is  we're totally fucked. Now I don't know about you  but Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings    evolutionarily  they're designed to see patterns in things. For example  in cheese sandwiches. Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary  I tried to make it a little bit clearer. Is it the Virgin Mary  Or is it Mena Trott  So  I talked to Josh Prince Ramus about the convention center and the conferences. It's getting awfully big. It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit. So we tried to come up with a program    how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED. So first of all we decided    that we needed about one third bookstore  one third Google cafe  about    percent registration     percent luxury hotel  about five percent for restrooms. And then of course  we wanted to have the simulcast lounge  the lobby and the Steinbeck forum. Now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program. So first  one of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming and Greenland melts as you say  the ocean level is going to rise    feet and flood the hell out of the convention center. So we're going to build this new building on stilts. So we build this building on stilts  then up here    is where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium. And the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is  it's going to be shaped in a spiral that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System. Then we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there. And finally  we're going to put the Marriott Hotel and the Portola Plaza on the top. Now I don't know about you  but sometimes I have these images in my head of separated at birth. I don't know about you  but when I see Aubrey de Grey  I immediately go to Gandalf the Grey. OK. Now  we've heard  of course  that we're all soldiers here. So what I'd really  really like you to do now is  pick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white piece of paper  And I want you to get out a pen  and I want you to write a terrorist note. If we put up the ELMO for a moment    if we put up the ELMO  then we'll get  you know  I'll give you a model that you can work from  OK  And then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane. And once you've folded it into a paper airplane  I want you to take some anthrax    and I want you to put that in the paper airplane. And then I want you to throw it on Jim Young. Luckily  I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year. And I wanted to see    I want to dedicate this film to my father  Homer. OK. Now this film isn't really hard enough  so I wanted to make it a little bit harder. So I'm going to try and do this while reciting pi.  .                                                                       . Can we cue the music please  Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit. Back in       you can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain was covered in     inches of snow pack. Parenthetically  over there on the slopes  I did want to show you that black men ski. But over the years     years later  the snow packs eroded  and  if you notice  the trees have started turning yellow. The water level of the lake has started drying up. A few years later  there's no snow left at all. And all the trees have turned brown. This year  unfortunately the lakebed's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed. And I fear  if we do nothing for our planet  in    years  it's going to look like this. Mr. Vice President  I wish I knew how to quit you. Thank you very much. I'd like to speak about technology trends  which is something that many of you follow    but we also follow  for related reasons. Obviously  being a technology magazine  technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about. But also it's part of being any monthly magazine    you live in the future. And we have a long lead time. We have to plan issues many months in advance  we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months  nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business. We also  like a lot of companies  create a product that's based on technology trends. In this case  ours is about ideas and information  and  if we're lucky  some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same. And so we have to understand not only why tech's important  where it's going  but also  very importantly  when    the timing is everything. And it's interesting  when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the     s  about e commerce  or Internet traffic  or broadband adoption  or Internet advertising  they were all right    they were just wrong in time. Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later. But the difference of a few years on stock market valuations is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything. You've probably seen something like this before. This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve  which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan. And just for fun  we put a bunch of technologies on it  to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak  or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment  or rise back in the slope of enlightenment  etc. And this is one way to do technology forecasting  get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn. We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important  we'll typically do it twice. Once  we want to do it first. We want to be the first to do it  for the geeks who appreciate that  we'll catch it right there at the technology trigger. You can see in       we put Linux on the cover. But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream  and they're going to burst out. And then it's time to do it again. Last year. And that's one way that we try to time technology trends. I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my  grand unified theory of predicting the future   but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future. It's based on the presumption  the observation even  that all important technologies go through four stages in their life    at least one of the four stages  sometimes all four of the stages. And at each one of these stages  can be seen as a collision    a collision with something else    for example  a critical price line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point. And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be  and maybe how you can do something about it. The first is the critical price. The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price. After it falls below a critical price  it will tend  if it's successful  to rise above a critical mass  a penetration. Many technologies  at that point  displace another technology  and that's another important point. And then finally  a lot of technologies commoditize. Towards the end of their life  they become nearly free. Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it  it's an opportunity for the technology to change. And even if you missed  you know  the first boom of Wi Fi    you know  Wi Fi did the critical price  it did the critical mass  but hasn't done displacement yet  and hasn't done free yet    there's still more opportunity in that. I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD  which is a technology which has done all of these. The DVD  as you know  was introduced in the mid     s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by       it had fallen below     dollars  and     dollars was a psychological threshold. And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up  the hidden inflection point    it was taking off. The next thing it hit  a year later  was critical mass. In this case     percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household. And what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it  home theater units. Suddenly you have a DVD in the house  you've got high quality digital video  you have a reason to have a big screen television  you have a reason for Dolby  .  surround sound. And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them  and bring the rest of your entertainment in. What's interesting also is    note that Netflix was founded in     . Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment  that was an inflection point that he could do something with. The next phase it hit was displacement. You can see around      it finally out sold the VCR. And here too  you can see the implications in the world at large. Netflix was right    the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video rental stores couldn't. Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small  you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply. That gave an advantage  that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody. And then finally  DVDs are approaching free. There's a company called Apex  a no name Chinese firm  who has  several times in the past year  been the number one DVD seller in America. Their average price  for last year  was    dollars. You're aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal Mart stampede over the    dollar DVD. But they're getting very  very cheap  and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper  the premium brands  the Sonys and such  are losing market share  and the no names  the Apexes  are gaining them. They're being commodified  and that's what happens when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there. Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology  these four stages of technology's life. I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there  just technologies on our radar    and I'll use this lens  these four  as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development. They're not necessarily the top    technologies out there    they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods. But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers  these intersections  are interesting to think about. Start with gene sequencing. As you probably know  gene sequencing    in a large part  because it's built on computers    is falling in price at a kind of a Moore's Law like level. It is now possible    will be possible  and if Craig Venter indeed comes today  he may tell you something about this    to sequence the human genome for    million dollars by the end of this year. That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago. You know  our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer. What's interesting is that at the same time  the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly. Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test. There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done  very cheaply  if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic. Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price. This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti retroviral drug compounds and cocktails. In January       the price was        dollars  or    dollars a day. The generics came in  first in Brazil and elsewhere  and the effect was just dramatic on pricing. Today it's less than    cents a day. And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity  if you look at the correlation between these two  as the anti retrovirals come down  the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by         two million in sub Saharan Africa. And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that. Linux is another good example. Now we've switched to critical mass. These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass. If you look here  here's Linux in red  and it's hit    percent. Interestingly  it's done a crossover before  but not the crossovers that matter. The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue. But you can look and see the direction those lines are going  you can see that at the    percent  it's now taken seriously. It's not just for the geeks any more. That is  I imagine  what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about. Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars. I don't know whether anybody has a Prius       but they're fantastic. And if you look at the trends here  by about         and I don't think this is a crazy forecast    they'll be two percent of auto sales. Two percent isn't    percent  but in the car business  which is slow moving  that's huge  that's arrival. At two percent  you start seeing them on the roads everywhere. And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry. It's the first radical change in automobile technology in     years. And once you have electric motors  you can do anything  you can change the structure of the car in any way you want. You can have regenerative braking  you can have drive by wire  you can have replaceable body shapes    it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid  but it can lead to a whole new era of the car. Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about. Again  it's kind of coming out of nowhere  it's a little hard to use right now. There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype. Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year  they already have nearly four million registered users    that's critical mass. And the same thing's happening on the carrier side. You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards. This is a tipping point    if Malcolm's here  forgive me    and it's going to change the economics  and the speed  and the players in the industry. It's going to look a little bit like that. And finally  free. Free is really  really interesting. Free is something that comes with digital  because the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP  because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics  because there's so much bandwidth. Free is really  you know  the gift of Silicon Valley to the world. It's an economic force  it's a technical force. It's a deflationary force  if not handled right. It is abundance  as opposed to scarcity. Free is probably the most interesting thing. And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive. You know  there could be a film's  unclear  there  but it's basically  every song ever made could be stored on     dollars worth of storage by     . It takes that entire element  the physical element  of songs off the table. And you've seen the numbers. I mean  you know  the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes  and Hollywood's worried as well. They're facing a force that they haven't faced before. And their response is draconian  and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this. And finally  I'll give you one last example of free    perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics    their abundance tends to make things free. This is the price of a phone call to India per minute. And what's interesting is that it was just      when it was more than two dollars a minute. India had  still has  a regulated phone system and so did we. It was surprisingly non innovative  moved very slowly  but then there was just so much fiber out there  you couldn't hold back  and look how quickly the price fell. It's seven cents a minute  in many cases. And the consequence of cheap phone calling  free phone calling  to India  is the pissed off programmer  is the outsourcing. It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today. The force of India  and then China  and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies    because the communications are free    is just beginning to be felt. And I think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today. Thank you. Sergey Brin  I want to discuss a question I know that's been pressing on many of your minds. We spoke to you last several years ago. And before I get started today  since many of you are wondering  I just wanted to get it out of the way. The answer is boxers. Now I hope all of you feel better. Do you know what this might be  Does anyone know what that is  Audience  Yes. SB  What is it  Audience  It's people logging on to Google around the world. SB  Wow  OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it. But this is what helped me see it. This is what we run at the office  that actually runs real time. Here it's slightly logged. But here you can see around the world how people are using Google. And every one of those rising dots represents probably about        searches  or something like that. And they're labeled by color right now  by language. So you can see  here we are in the U.S.  and they're all coming up red. There we are in Monterey    hopefully I can get it right. You can see that Japan is busy at night  right there. We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese. There's a lot of activity in China. There's a lot of activity in India. There's some in the Middle East  the little pockets. And Europe  which is right now in the middle of the day  is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages. Now you can also see  if I turn this around here    hopefully I won't shake the world too much. But you can also see  there are places where there's not so much. Australia  because there just aren't very many people there. And this is something that we should really work on  which is Africa  which is just a few trickles  basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities. But basically  what we've noticed is these queries  which come in at thousands per second  are available everywhere there is power. And pretty much everywhere there is power  there is the Internet. And even in Antarctica    well  at least this time of year    we from time to time will see a query rising up. And if we had it plotted correctly  I think the International Space Station would have it  too. So this is some of the challenge that we have here  is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the    there we go. This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. You can see that there's a lot of data running around. It has to go all over the world  through fibers  through satellites  through all kinds of connections. And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good. But you can see also  once again    so some places are much more wired than others  and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.  going up over to Asia  Europe in the other direction  and so forth. Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. And if we can switch to slides    all right  here we go. So this is slowed down. This is what one second looks like. And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing  is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load. Now  each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own. I mean  it could be somebody's health  it could be somebody's career  something important to them. And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce  or in this case  ketchup. So this is a query that we had    I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others. You can see that it got started right here. In the U.S. and Spain  it was popular at the same time. But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S. as it did in Spain. And then from Spain  it went to Italy  and then Germany got excited  and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it. And so I guess the U.S. finally  finally started to like it  too. And I just wanted to play it for you. Anyway  you can all enjoy it for yourselves    hopefully that search will work. As a part of    you know  part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches. And what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated. More animals  if they start doing searches as well. But partly  we want to make the world a better place  and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation  and we're in the process of setting that up. We also have a program already called Google Grants that now serves over     different charities around the world  and these are some of the charities that are on there. And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of. In fact  many of the organizations that are here    the Acumen Fund  I think ApproTEC we have running  I'm not sure if that one's up yet    and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. They run Google ads  and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know. One of the earlier results that we got    we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of    Vietnamese girls for their education  and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said  now there have been many  many stories that have come in  because we do have hundreds of charities in there  and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor. Now does anybody know who this is  A ha  Audience  Orkut. SB  Yes  Somebody got it. This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut  Do we have any  Okay  not very many people know about it. I'll explain it in a second. This is one of our engineers. We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves. That's how we churn those products out. Orkut had a vision to create a social network. I know all of you are thinking   Yet another social network.  But it was a dream of his  and we  basically  when people really want to do something  well  we generally let them. So this is what he built. We just released it in a test phase last month  and it's been taking off. This is our VP of Engineering. You can see the red hair  and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there. And these are all of his friends. So this is how    we just deployed it    we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service  and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. And now we've grown to over         members. And they spread  actually  very quickly  even outside the U.S. You can see  even though the U.S. is still the majority here    though  by the way  search wise  it's only about    percent of our traffic    but it's already going to Japan  and the U.K.  and Europe  and all the rest of the countries. So it's a fun little project. There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. And    well  I'll leave you in suspense. Larry  you can explain this one. Larry Page  Thank you  Sergey. So one of the things    both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school  and I think  for some reason  this has been incorporated in Google. And Sergey mentioned Orkut  which is something that  you know  Orkut wanted to do in his time  and we call this    at Google  we've embodied this as  the    percent time   and the idea is  for    percent of your time  if you're working at Google  you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And many  many things at Google have come out of that  such as Orkut and also Google News. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. Mendel  who was supposed to be teaching high school students  actually  you know  discovered the laws of genetics    as a hobby  basically. So many  many useful things come out of this. And News  which I just mentioned  was started by a researcher. And he just    he    after       he got really interested in the news. And he said   Why don't I look at the news better   And so he started clustering it by category  and then he started using it  and then his friends started using it. And then  besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom  we made it a Googlette  which is basically a small project at Google. So it'd be like three people  or something like that  and they would try to make a product. And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not. And in News' case  you know  they had a couple of people working on it for a while  and then more and more people started using it  and then we put it out on the Internet  and more and more people started using it. And now it's a real  full blown project with more people on it. And this is how we keep our innovation running. I think usually  as companies get bigger  they find it really hard to have small  innovative projects. And we had this problem  too  for a while  and we said   Oh  we really need a new concept.  You know  the Googlettes    that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not  but we hope it will  and if we do enough of them  some of them will really work and turn out  such as News. But then we had a problem because then we had over     projects. And I don't know about all of you  but I have trouble keeping     things in my head at once. And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them    and these are kind of made up. Don't really pay attention to them. For example  the  Buy Iceland  was from a media article. We would never do such a crazy thing  but    in any case  we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them  that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be. And this was kind of a surprise to me  but we found that as long as you keep the     things in your head  which you did by writing them down  that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources. And so that's basically what we've done since we instituted that a few years ago  and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well organized. The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important  and so naturally  people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities. I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new  or you might not know about. And the top thing  actually  is the Deskbar. So this is a new    how many of you use the Google Toolbar  Raise your hands. How many of you use the Deskbar  All right  see  You guys should try it out. But if you go to our site and search for  Deskbar   you'll get this. And the idea is  instead of a toolbar  it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom  and you can do searches really easily. And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar. Thank you  Sergey. This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about  and they just  they got going  and it's really  really a great product  and really taking off. Google Answers is something we started  which is really cool  which lets you    for five to     dollars  you can type a question in  and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you  and it's guaranteed and all that  and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself. Froogle lets you search shopping information  and Blogger lets you publish things. But all of these    well  these were all sort of innovative things that we did that    you know  we try many  many different things in our company. We also like to innovate in our physical space  and we noticed in meetings  you know  you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off  and they're noisy  so people shut them off. And we didn't like that  so we actually  in maybe a couple of weeks  we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors  and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. And as a result  we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting  so when you walk into a meeting room now  it lists all the meetings that are happening  you can very easily take notes  and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. And as we become more of a global company  we find these things really affect us    you know  can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room  And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference. We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings  and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines  for our younger employees especially  and ... we also allow dogs and things like that  and we've had  I think  a really fun culture at our company  which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing. This is actually our  cult picture.  I just wanted to show quickly. We had this on our website for a while  but we found that after we put it on our website  we didn't get any job applications anymore. But anyway  every year we've taken the whole company on a ski trip. A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other  and informally. And I think we've done a good job encouraging that. It makes it a really fun place to work. Along with our logos  too  which I think really embody our culture when we change things. In the early days  we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand  you know  because  you know  you'd never want to change your logo. You want it to be consistent. And we said   Well  that doesn't sound so much fun. Why don't we try changing it every day   One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now is we have this thing called AdSense  and this is a little bit foreshadowing    this is from before Dean dropped out. But the idea is  like  on a newspaper  for example  we show you relevant ads. And this is hard to read  but this says  Battle for New Hampshire  Howard Dean for President     articles on Howard Dean. And these ads are generated automatically    like in this case  on the Washington Post    from the content on the site. And so we use our over         advertisers and millions of advertisements  so we pick the one that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at  much as we do on search. So the idea is we can make advertising useful  not just annoying  right  And the nice thing about this  we have a self serve program  and many thousands of websites have signed up  and this let's them really make money. And I    you know  there's a number of people I met    I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party  and he said   You know  I wasn't making any money. I just put this thing on my site and I'm making        dollars a month. And  you know  thank you. I don't have to do my other job now.  And I think this is really important for us  because it makes the Internet work better. It makes content get better  it makes searching work better  when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content. So this session is supposed to be about the future  so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it. And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search  you really have to be smart. Because you can type  you know  any kind of thing into Google  and you expect an answer back  right  But finding things is tricky  and so you really want intelligence. And in fact  the ultimate search engine would be smart. It would be artificial intelligence. And so that's something we work on  and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now  and that's really their goal. So we always hope that Google will be smart  but we're always surprised when other people think that it is. And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this. This is a blog from Iraq  and it's not really what I'm going to talk about  but I just wanted to show you an example. Maybe  Sergey  you can highlight this. So we decided    actually  the highlight's right there. Oh  thank you. So   related searches   right there. You can't see it that well  but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads  called  related searches.  And so we'd say  you know   Did you mean 'search for'     what is this  in this case   Saddam Hussein   because this blog is about Iraq    and you know  in addition to the ads  and we thought this would be a great idea. And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed  and he said   You know  I'm sleeping a lot.  He was just kind of writing about his life. And our algorithms    not a person  of course  but our algorithms  our computers    read his blog and decided that the related search was   I am bored.  And he read this  and he thought a person had decided that he was boring  and it was very unfortunate  and he said   You know  what are these  you know  bastards at Google doing  Why don't they like my blog   And so then we read his blog  which was getting    you know  sort of going from bad to worse  and we said the related search was   Retards.  And then  you know  he got even more mad  and he wrote    like  started swearing and so on. And then we produced  You suck.  And finally  it ended with  Kiss my ass.  And so basically  he thought he was dealing with something smart  and of course  you know  we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out  and it didn't quite work  and we don't have this feature anymore. So with that  maybe I can switch back to the world. I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google  and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising  and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about  you know  places that don't have as much money. So we don't have to worry about our products being sold  for example  for less money in places that are poor  and then they get re imported into the U.S.    for example  with the drug industry. And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search  and I think that's a tremendous  tremendous benefit. The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information  and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine    that we should provide very objective information. And so in our search results  we never accept payment for our search results. We accept payment for advertising  and we mark it as such. And that's unlike many of our competitors. And I think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world  and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google. So thank you. The immersive ugliness of our everyday environments in America is entropy made visible. We can't overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this. And mostly  I want to persuade you that we have to do better if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America. By the way  this doesn't help. Nobody's having a better day down here because of that. There are a lot of ways you can describe this. You know  I like to call it  the national automobile slum.  You can call it suburban sprawl. I think it's appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck. And it's a tremendous problem for us. The outstanding    the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about. We're going to talk about that some more. A sense of place  your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings  and to employ the vocabularies  grammars  syntaxes  rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are. The public realm in America has two roles  it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life  and it is the physical manifestation of the common good. And when you degrade the public realm  you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there. The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we don't have the       year old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures. And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design. This is a body of knowledge  method  skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after World War II and decided we don't need that anymore  we're not going to use it. And consequently  we can see the result all around us. The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically  but it has to inform us where we are in our culture. Where we've come from  what kind of people we are  and it needs to  by doing that  it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present. And if there is one tremendous    if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built  the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last    years  it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present. The environments we are living in  more typically  are like these. You know  this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town. And remember  to create a place of character and quality  you have to be able to define space. So how is that being accomplished here  If you stand on the apron of the Wal Mart over here and try to look at the Target store over here  you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth.  Laughter  That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space. Consequently  these will be places that nobody wants to be in. These will be places that are not worth caring about. We have about  you know         places that are not worth caring about in the United States today. When we have enough of them  we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending. And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq  spilling their blood in the sand  and ask yourself   What is their last thought of home   I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for.  Applause  We need better places in this country. Public space. This is a good public space. It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined. It is emphatically an outdoor public room. It has something that is terribly important    it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge. That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops  bars  bistros  destinations    things go in and out of it. It's permeable. The beer goes in and out  the waitresses go in and out  and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in. You know  in these places in other cultures  people just go there voluntarily because they like them. We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here.  Laughter  You know  you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival. People just go because it's pleasurable to be there. But this is how we do it in the United States. Probably the most significant public space failure in America  designed by the leading architects of the day  Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei  Boston City Hall Plaza. A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there.  Laughter  And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive  and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it. And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings. This is the other side of the building. This was the winner of an international design award in  I think        something like that. It wasn't Pei and Cobb  another firm designed this  but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block. This is the back of Boston City Hall  the most important  you know  significant civic building in Albany    excuse me    in Boston. And what is the message that is coming  what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming  from this building and how is it informing us about who we are  This  in fact  would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin  Pol Pot  Saddam Hussein  and all the other great despots of the   th century on the side of the building  because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us. You know  that it's a despotic building  it wants us to feel like termites.  Laughter  This is it on a smaller scale  the back of the civic center in my town  Saratoga Springs  New York. By the way  when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town  they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken   Laughter  and they shouted at me and said   It was raining that day when you took that picture   Because this was perceived to be a weather problem.  Laughter  You know  this is a building designed like a DVD player.  Laughter  Audio jack  power supply    and look  you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms  right  You know  we hire firms to design these things. You can see exactly what went on  three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting. You know  eight hours before deadline  four architects trying to get this building in on time  right  And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings  and the renderings  and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table  and    I mean  what was the conversation that was going on there   Laughter  Because you know what the last word was  what the last sentence was of that meeting. It was   Fuck it.   Laughter   Applause  That    that is the message of this form of architecture. The message is  We don't give a fuck  We don't give a fuck. So I went back on the nicest day of the year  just to    you know    do some reality testing  and in fact  he will not even go down there because  Laughter  it's not interesting enough for his clients  you know  the burglars  the muggers. It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there. OK. The pattern of Main Street USA    in fact  this pattern of building downtown blocks  all over the world  is fairly universal. It's not that complicated  buildings more than one story high  built out to the sidewalk edge  so that people who are  you know  all kinds of people can get into the building. Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs  you know  apartments  offices  and so on. You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor. They haven't learned that in Monterey. If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center  you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner. It's really incredible. Anyway  this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building  and this is what happened when in Glens Falls  New York  when we tried to do it again  where it was missing  right  So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty. OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk  where the theoretical pedestrians are.  Laughter  Of course  they'll never be there  as long as this is in that condition. Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed  we pop a handicapped ramp on that  and then to make ourselves feel better  we put a nature Band Aid in front of it. And that's how we do it. I call them  nature Band Aids  because there's a general idea in America that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature. And in fact  the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism  good buildings. Not just flower beds  not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. You know  that's not good enough. We have to do good buildings. The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it  To spatially denote the pedestrian realm  to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway  to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk  and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling    a vaulted ceiling    over the street  at its best. And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees. They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods  they're not supposed to be a set for  The Last of the Mohicans.  You know  one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town  between the urban and the rural. They're not the same thing. And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city  which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time. Here you see it on a small scale    the mothership has landed  R  D  and C  PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet.  Laughter  A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city  city life  and everything connected with it. And so what you see fairly early  in the mid   th century  is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city  which is going to be life in the country for everybody. And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb  the country villa along the railroad line  which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city  but to return to the countryside every night. And believe me  there were no Wal Marts or convenience stores out there then  so it really was a form of country living. But what happens is  of course  it mutates over the next    years and it turns into something rather insidious. It becomes a cartoon of a country house  in a cartoon of the country. And that's the great non articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule. Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now. And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there  you know. Basically  a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state  emphatically   I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me. I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see.  So you have this one last facade of the house  the front  which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house. Because    notice the porch here. Unless the people that live here are Munchkins  nobody's going to be using that. This is really  in fact  a television broadcasting a show      called  We're Normal.  We're normal  we're normal  we're normal  we're normal  we're normal. Please respect us  we're normal  we're normal  we're normal. But we know what's going on in these houses  you know. We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here  getting ready for homeroom.  Laughter  We know that Heather  his sister Heather     years old  is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit. Because these places  these habitats  are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children  and they don't have a lot of experience with medication. So they take the first one that comes along  often. These are not good enough for Americans. These are the schools we are sending them to  The Hannibal Lecter Central School  Las Vegas  Nevada. This is a real school  You know  but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out  that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver. So every effort is made to keep them within the building. Notice that nature is present.  Laughter  We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not. We are entering an epochal period of change in the world  and    certainly in America    the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era. It is going to change absolutely everything. Chris asked me not to go on too long about this  and I won't  except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy. Forget it. It's not going to happen. We're going to have to do something else instead. We're going to have to down scale  re scale  and re size virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it. We're going to have     Applause     we're going to have to live closer to where we work. We're going to have to live closer to each other. We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live. The age of the       mile Caesar salad is coming to an end. We're going to have to    we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of  We gotta do better than that  And we should have started two days before yesterday. We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there  for the last    years  excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents' generation after World War II. Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns. We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to re learn how to compose meaningful places  places that are integral  that allow    that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life and our communal life  deployed in an integral fashion. So that  you know  the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business  of culture and of governance. We're going to have to re learn what the building blocks of these things are  the street  the block  how to compose public space that's both large and small  the courtyard  the civic square and how to really make use of this property. We can see some of the first ideas for retro fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America. The dead malls  what are we going to do with them  Well  in point of fact  most of them are not going to make it. They're not going to be retro fitted  they're going to be the salvage yards of the future. Some of them we're going to fix  though. And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development. And if we're lucky  the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities. And by the way  our towns and cities are where they are  and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites. And most of them are still going to be there  although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished. We've got a lot of work to do. We're not going to be rescued by the hyper car  we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels. No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running  the way we're running it. We're going to have to do everything very differently. And America's not prepared. We are sleepwalking into the future. We're not ready for what's coming at us. So I urge you all to do what you can. Life in the mid   st century is going to be about living locally. Be prepared to be good neighbors. Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens. One final thing    I've been very disturbed about this for years  but I think it's particularly important for this audience. Please  please  stop referring to yourselves as  consumers.  OK  Consumers are different than citizens. Consumers do not have obligations  responsibilities and duties to their fellow human beings. And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion  you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having. And we're going to continue being clueless going into this very difficult future that we face. So thank you very much. Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending.  Applause  There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world and at IDEO this past year  and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you. I didn't attend the first TED back in      but I've been to a lot of them since that time. I thought it  would  kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much  Richard  it's been a big  enjoyable part of my life  coming here. And so thinking back  I was thinking those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects    certainly technological objects. And so it was great fun in those days  and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients. We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we'd put it on the conference table  and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would  ooh  and  ah.  That was a really good time. And so we'll continue to focus on products  as we always have. And if you were here last year  I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule    which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring. And I took a lot of pictures last year  very few people knew what I was up to  but I took a lot of pictures. This year    maybe you could show the slides    this year we're carrying this Treo  which we had a lot to do with and helped Handspring design it. Also  though we designed it a few years ago    it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so    this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives. Maybe you've seen them in the airports  They seem to be everywhere now. Lots of lives are being saved by those. And  we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read. So  we really will continue to focus on products. But something's happened in the last    years since Richard started TED  and that's that people like us    I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time  but for us  we've really just started ... we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit    and so we're now focused more and more on human centered design  human centeredness in an approach to design. That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products. And I think you're starting to see that  and it's making our job even more enjoyable. Interestingly enough  we used to primarily build   D models    you know  you've seen some today    and   D renderings. Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas. But firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion  showing how they'll be used. And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man machine relationship. And it's a much better way to see. It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses  as opposed to them being empty. So I thought that I would show you a few videos to show off this new  broader definition of design in products and services and environments. I have a few of them    they're no more than a minute or a minute and a half apiece    but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year  and how it responds in video. So  Prada New York  we were asked by Rem Koolhaas and OMA to help us conceive the technology that's in their retail store in New York. He wanted a new kind of store    a new one    a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one. And that meant actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use. So  there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags  there's RF tags on the user  on the cards  there's the staff devices that are all around the store. You pick them up  and once you see something that you're interested in  the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store. You can look at color  and sizes  and how it appeared on the runway  or whatever. And so then the object    the merchandise that you're interested in    can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room  and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room. We can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that  and get more information about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on. It's been used a lot of places  but I particularly like the use here of liquid crystal displays in the changing room. The last time I went to see this store  there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering   Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here   But if you push the button  of course  the whole wall goes dark. So you can try to get approval  or not  for whatever you're wearing. And then one of my favorite features of the technology is the magic mirror  where you put on the clothes. There's a big display in the mirror  and you can turn around    but there's a three second delay. So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around  as you look. About a year and a half ago we were asked to design an installation in the museum    this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London  and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues. And a group at Itch  which is now part of IDEO  designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall. I don't know if anybody's seen this    it's pretty spectacular in the room. Anyway  it's based on the London subway system. And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving  and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see. So you enter your information. Then  like the London tube system  the little trains go around with what you're thinking about. And then when you get to a station  it's expanded so that you can actually read it. Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor    mostly teenagers coming out of there    there's this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun  also designed by Durrell  Bishop  and Andrew  Hirniak  of Itch. And the topics include things that the museum is about  male fertility  choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like. There's lots of room  so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved. And also  it's not shown in the video  but these are very beautiful. They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top  after they've bounced around  they disperse into bits and go off into the atmosphere. The next video is not done by us. This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago. Scott Adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn't help to design the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert  which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up. He's always been interested in technology in the future. the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles. So we thought  well  wouldn't it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better  Narrator  Though they work in a wide open office space spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge  the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems. Woman  A one way mirror. I can look out  you can look at yourself. Narrator  They took pictures. Woman  You feel so trapped  when someone kind of leans over and you're sort of held captive there for a minute. SA  So far it's chaos  but a lot of people are doing stuff  so that's good. We'll see what happens. Narrator  The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens for the computer and for family photos. In the second group's scenario  the walls are alive and actually give Dilbert a group hug. Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.  David Kelley  So here's the final thing  complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across    that follows the tracks of the sun    across the sky. So you feel that in your cubicle. And my favorite feature  which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment  and then when you come back  it comes up to greet you  happy to see you. DK  You know  it has homey touches like a built in fish tank in the walls  or something to be aggressive with to release tension. DK  And of course  a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle. DK  This next project  we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London. The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it  as well as wastewater. So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time. The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful. In contrast to if you went inside the dome  where it's kind of wild and crazy and everybody's learning all kinds of things  or fooling around  or whatever they're doing. But it was intended to be quite quiet. And then you would wander around and gather information  in a straightforward fashion  about the recycling process and what's being done  and how they're going to reuse the water once it comes through the plant. And then  if you saw  the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information on the front side  but as they rotate  you can see the actual recycling plant behind  with all the machines as they actually process the water. You can see  there's the plant. These are all very low budget videos  like quick prototypes. And we're announcing a new product here tonight  which is the first time this has ever been shown in public. It's called Spyfish  and it's a company called H Eye  started by Nigel Jagger in London. And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience    many people have boats  or enjoy being on boats  but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what's there  and enjoying what scuba divers do. This product  it has two cameras. You throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet. For us    there's the object    for us  it was two projects. One  to design the interface so that the interface doesn't get in your way. You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater    of feeling like you're underwater    seeing what's going on. And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool. And so we spent a lot of time    this has been going on for about seven or eight years  this project    and  we're  just ready to start building them. It can dive to     feet  to where sunlight does not penetrate  and is equipped with powerful lights. It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep. The battery powered Spyfish sends the live video feed through a slender cable.  DK  This slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is. Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control. You watch the video with superimposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading. The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater.  DK  And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC  which is a project that I'm very excited about. ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher  who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford. He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright and he had a very interesting insight  which is that he said   There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya  there must be entrepreneurs everywhere.  And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there they could find enough money to put something together. So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya with Kenyan manufacturers    designed by people like us  but taken there. And to this date    he's been gone for only a few years    he's started        companies. He's made        new jobs. And just the sales of the products    this is a non profit    the sales of these products is now .   of the GDP of Kenya. This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing. So we're in the process of helping them design deep well  low cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off season. What they do now is  they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can't grow them in the off season. And so by doing that  the woman that you saw in the first thing    she's a school teacher    always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things. So with seed squeezers  and pumps  and hay balers and very straightforward things that we're designing    my students are doing this as class projects and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work    it's really amazing to see his success  Martin's. We also were thinking about the experience of Richard  and so       we designed this hat  because I knew I'd be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say. Can you read it  Well  it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers. You know  you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty  and so I thought this would do it  where I just sit here. So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session  and from all the different presenters. And in my own practice  from product to ApproTEC  it's really exciting that we're taking a more human centered approach to design  that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do  and I think this is great. Designers are more trusted and more integrated into the business strategy of companies  and I have to say  for one  I feel very lucky at the progress that design has made since the first TED. Thanks a lot. I do two things  I design mobile computers and I study brains. And today's talk is about brains and  yay  somewhere I have a brain fan out there. I'm going to  if I can have my first slide up here  and you'll see the title of my talk and my two affiliations. So what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory  why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it. And I'll try to do all that in    minutes. I have two affiliations. Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days  but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park  and we study theoretical neuroscience  and we study how the neocortex works. I'm going to talk all about that. I have one slide on my other life  the computer life  and that's the slide here. These are some of the products I've worked on over the last    years  starting back from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on  and ending up most recently with the Treo  and we're continuing to do this. And I've done this because I really believe that mobile computing is the future of personal computing  and I'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things. But this was  I have to admit  all an accident. I really didn't want to do any of these products and very early in my career I decided I was not going to be in the computer industry. And before I tell you about that  I just have to tell you this one little picture of graffiti there I picked off the web the other day. I was looking for a picture of graffiti  little text input language  and I found the website dedicated to teachers who want to make these  you know  the script writing things across the top of their blackboard  and they had added graffiti to it  and I'm sorry about that. So what happened was  when I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in '    I decided    I went to work for Intel and I was in the computer industry    and three months into that  I fell in love with something else  and I said   I made the wrong career choice here   and I fell in love with brains. This is not a real brain. This is a picture of one  a line drawing. But I don't remember exactly how it happened  but I have one recollection  which was pretty strong in my mind. In September       Scientific American came out with a single topic issue about the brain. And it was quite good. It was one of the best issues ever. And they talked about the neuron and development and disease and vision and all the things you might want to know about brains. It was really quite impressive. And one might have the impression that we really knew a lot about brains. But the last article in that issue was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame. Today is  I think  the   th anniversary of the discovery of DNA. And he wrote a story basically saying  well  this is all well and good  but you know what  we don't know diddley squat about brains and no one has a clue how these things work  so don't believe what anyone tells you. This is a quote from that article. He said   What is conspicuously lacking   he's a very proper British gentleman so   What is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches.  I thought the word framework was great. He didn't say we didn't even have a theory. He says  we don't even know how to begin to think about it    we don't even have a framework. We are in the pre paradigm days  if you want to use Thomas Kuhn. And so I fell in love with this  and said look  we have all this knowledge about brains. How hard can it be  And this is something we can work on my lifetime. I felt I could make a difference  and so I tried to get out of the computer business  into the brain business. First  I went to MIT  the AI lab was there  and I said  well  I want to build intelligent machines  too  but the way I want to do it is to study how brains work first. And they said  oh  you don't need to do that. We're just going to program computers  that's all we need to do. And I said  no  you really ought to study brains. They said  oh  you know  you're wrong. And I said  no  you're wrong  and I didn't get in. But I was a little disappointed    pretty young    but I went back again a few years later and this time was in California  and I went to Berkeley. And I said  I'll go in from the biological side. So I got in    in the Ph.D. program in biophysics  and I was  all right  I'm studying brains now  and I said  well  I want to study theory. And they said  oh no  you can't study theory about brains. That's not something you do. You can't get funded for that. And as a graduate student  you can't do that. So I said  oh my gosh. I was very depressed. I said  but I can make a difference in this field. So what I did is I went back in the computer industry and said  well  I'll have to work here for a while  do something. That's when I designed all those computer products. And I said  I want to do this for four years  make some money  like I was having a family  and I would mature a bit  and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit. Well  it took longer than four years. It's been about    years. But I'm doing it now  and I'm going to tell you about it. So why should we have a good brain theory  Well  there's lots of reasons people do science. One is    the most basic one is    people like to know things. We're curious  and we just go out and get knowledge  you know  Why do we study ants  Well  it's interesting. Maybe we'll learn something really useful about it  but it's interesting and fascinating. But sometimes  a science has some other attributes which makes it really  really interesting. Sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves  it'll tell us who we are. Rarely  you know  evolution did this and Copernicus did this  where we have a new understanding of who we are. And after all  we are our brains. My brain is talking to your brain. Our bodies are hanging along for the ride  but my brain is talking to your brain. And if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive  we really understand what brains are. Another thing is sometimes science leads to really big societal benefits and technologies  or businesses  or whatever  that come out of it. And this is one  too  because when we understand how brains work  we're going to be able to build intelligent machines  and I think that's actually a good thing on the whole  and it's going to have tremendous benefits to society  just like a fundamental technology. So why don't we have a good theory of brains  And people have been working on it for     years. Well  let's first take a look at what normal science looks like. This is normal science. Normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists. And so the theorist guys say  well  I think this is what's going on  and the experimentalist says  no  you're wrong. And it goes back and forth  you know  This works in physics. This works in geology. But if this is normal science  what does neuroscience look like  This is what neuroscience looks like. We have this mountain of data  which is anatomy  physiology and behavior. You can't imagine how much detail we know about brains. There were        people who went to the neuroscience conference this year  and every one of them is doing research in brains. A lot of data. But there's no theory. There's a little  wimpy box on top there. And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences. And it's a real shame. Now why has this come about  If you ask neuroscientists  why is this the state of affair  they'll first of all admit it. But if you ask them  they'll say  well  there's various reasons we don't have a good brain theory. Some people say  well  we don't still have enough data  we need to get more information  there's all these things we don't know. Well  I just told you there's so much data coming out your ears. We have so much information  we don't even know how to begin to organize it. What good is more going to do  Maybe we'll be lucky and discover some magic thing  but I don't think so. This is actually a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory. We don't need more data    we need a good theory about it. Another one is sometimes people say  well  brains are so complex  it'll take another    years. I even think Chris said something like this yesterday. I'm not sure what you said  Chris  but something like  well  it's one of the most complicated things in the universe. That's not true. You're more complicated than your brain. You've got a brain. And it's also  although the brain looks very complicated  things look complicated until you understand them. That's always been the case. And so all we can say  well  my neocortex  which is the part of the brain I'm interested in  has    billion cells. But  you know what  It's very  very regular. In fact  it looks like it's the same thing repeated over and over and over again. It's not as complex as it looks. That's not the issue. Some people say  brains can't understand brains. Very Zen like. Whoo.  Laughter  You know  it sounds good  but why  I mean  what's the point  It's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver. It's got a lot of cells in it too  right  So  you know  I don't think there's anything to that. And finally  some people say  well  you know  I don't feel like a bunch of cells  you know. I'm conscious. I've got this experience  I'm in the world  you know. I can't be just a bunch of cells. Well  you know  people used to believe there was a life force to be living  and we now know that's really not true at all. And there's really no evidence that says    well  other than people just have disbelief that cells can do what they do. And so  if some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism  some really smart people  too  but we can reject all that. No  I'm going to tell you there's something else  and it's really fundamental  and this is what it is  there's another reason why we don't have a good brain theory  and it's because we have an intuitive  strongly held  but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer. There's something we believe that just  it's obvious  but it's wrong. Now  there's a history of this in science and before I tell you what it is  I'm going to tell you a bit about the history of it in science. You look at some other scientific revolutions  and this case  I'm talking about the solar system  that's Copernicus  Darwin's evolution  and tectonic plates  that's Wegener. They all have a lot in common with brain science. First of all  they had a lot of unexplained data. A lot of it. But it got more manageable once they had a theory. The best minds were stumped    really  really smart people. We're not smarter now than they were then. It just turns out it's really hard to think of things  but once you've thought of them  it's kind of easy to understand it. My daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework by the time they were in kindergarten. And now it's not that hard  you know  here's the apple  here's the orange  you know  the Earth goes around  that kind of stuff. Finally  another thing is the answer was there all along  but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing  and that's the thing. It was an intuitive  strong held belief that was wrong. In the case of the solar system  the idea that the Earth is spinning and the surface of the Earth is going like a thousand miles an hour  and the Earth is going through the solar system about a million miles an hour. This is lunacy. We all know the Earth isn't moving. Do you feel like you're moving a thousand miles an hour  Of course not. You know  and someone who said  well  it was spinning around in space and it's so huge  they would lock you up  and that's what they did back then. So it was intuitive and obvious. Now what about evolution  Evolution's the same thing. We taught our kids  well  the Bible says  you know  God created all these species  cats are cats  dogs are dogs  people are people  plants are plants  they don't change. Noah put them on the Ark in that order  blah  blah  blah. And  you know  the fact is  if you believe in evolution  we all have a common ancestor  and we all have a common ancestry with the plant in the lobby. This is what evolution tells us. And  it's true. It's kind of unbelievable. And the same thing about tectonic plates  you know  All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the Earth  you know  It's like  it doesn't make any sense. So what is the intuitive  but incorrect assumption  that's kept us from understanding brains  Now I'm going to tell it to you  and it's going to seem obvious that that is correct  and that's the point  right  Then I'm going to have to make an argument why you're incorrect about the other assumption. The intuitive but obvious thing is that somehow intelligence is defined by behavior  that we are intelligent because of the way that we do things and the way we behave intelligently  and I'm going to tell you that's wrong. What it is is intelligence is defined by prediction. And I'm going to work you through this in a few slides here  give you an example of what this means. Here's a system. Engineers like to look at systems like this. Scientists like to look at systems like this. They say  well  we have a thing in a box  and we have its inputs and its outputs. The AI people said  well  the thing in the box is a programmable computer because that's equivalent to a brain  and we'll feed it some inputs and we'll get it to do something  have some behavior. And Alan Turing defined the Turing test  which is essentially saying  we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human. A behavioral metric of what intelligence is  and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time. Reality though  I call it real intelligence. Real intelligence is built on something else. We experience the world through a sequence of patterns  and we store them  and we recall them. And when we recall them  we match them up against reality  and we're making predictions all the time. It's an eternal metric. There's an eternal metric about us sort of saying  do we understand the world  Am I making predictions  And so on. You're all being intelligent right now  but you're not doing anything. Maybe you're scratching yourself  or picking your nose  I don't know  but you're not doing anything right now  but you're being intelligent  you're understanding what I'm saying. Because you're intelligent and you speak English  you know what word is at the end of this     Silence  sentence. The word came into you  and you're making these predictions all the time. And then  what I'm saying is  is that the eternal prediction is the output in the neocortex. And that somehow  prediction leads to intelligent behavior. And here's how that happens. Let's start with a non intelligent brain. Well I'll argue a non intelligent brain  we got hold of an old brain  and we're going to say it's like a non mammal  like a reptile  so I'll say  an alligator  we have an alligator. And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses. It's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on  a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior. It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you  you know. It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff. But we don't consider the alligator very intelligent  not like in a human sort of way. But it has all this complex behavior already. Now  in evolution  what happened  First thing that happened in evolution with mammals  we started to develop a thing called the neocortex. And I'm going to represent the neocortex here  by this box that's sticking on top of the old brain. Neocortex means new layer. It is a new layer on top of your brain. If you don't know it  it's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that  it's got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit. No  really  that's what it is. It's about the size of a table napkin. And it doesn't fit  so it gets all wrinkly. Now look at how I've drawn this here. The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain. You do. It's your emotional brain. It's all those things  and all those gut reactions you have. And on top of it  we have this memory system called the neocortex. And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain. And so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain  it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing. It's sitting there saying  ah  I'm going to memorize all the things that are going on  where I've been  people I've seen  things I've heard  and so on. And in the future  when it sees something similar to that again  so in a similar environment  or the exact same environment  it'll play it back. It'll start playing it back. Oh  I've been here before. And when you've been here before  this happened next. It allows you to predict the future. It allows you to  literally it feeds back the signals into your brain  they'll let you see what's going to happen next  will let you hear the word  sentence  before I said it. And it's this feeding back into the old brain that'll allow you to make very more intelligent decisions. This is the most important slide of my talk  so I'll dwell on it a little bit. And so  all the time you say  oh  I can predict the things. And if you're a rat and you go through a maze  and then you learn the maze  the next time you're in a maze  you have the same behavior  but all of a sudden  you're smarter because you say  oh  I recognize this maze  I know which way to go  I've been here before  I can envision the future. And that's what it's doing. In humans    by the way  this is true for all mammals  it's true for other mammals    and in humans  it got a lot worse. In humans  we actually developed the front part of the neocortex called the anterior part of the neocortex. And nature did a little trick. It copied the posterior part  the back part  which is sensory  and put it in the front part. And humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front  but we use it for motor control. So we are now able to make very sophisticated motor planning  things like that. I don't have time to get into all this  but if you want to understand how a brain works  you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works  how it is we store patterns and make predictions. So let me give you a few examples of predictions. I already said the word  sentence.  In music  if you've heard a song before  if you heard Jill sing those songs before  when she sings them  the next note pops into your head already    you anticipate it as you're going. If it was an album of music  the end of one album  the next song pops into your head. And these things happen all the time. You're making these predictions. I have this thing called the altered door thought experiment. And the altered door thought experiment says  you have a door at home  and when you're here  I'm changing it  I've got a guy back at your house right now  moving the door around  and they're going to take your doorknob and move it over two inches. And when you go home tonight  you're going to put your hand out there  and you're going to reach for the doorknob and you're going to notice it's in the wrong spot  and you'll go  whoa  something happened. It may take a second to figure out what it was  but something happened. Now I could change your doorknob in other ways. I can make it larger or smaller  I can change its brass to silver  I could make it a lever. I can change your door  put colors on  I can put windows in. I can change a thousand things about your door  and in the two seconds you take to open your door  you're going to notice that something has changed. Now  the engineering approach to this  the AI approach to this  is to build a door database. It has all the door attributes. And as you go up to the door  you know  let's check them off one at time. Door  door  door  you know  color  you know what I'm saying. We don't do that. Your brain doesn't do that. What your brain is doing is making constant predictions all the time about what is going to happen in your environment. As I put my hand on this table  I expect to feel it stop. When I walk  every step  if I missed it by an eighth of an inch  I'll know something has changed. You're constantly making predictions about your environment. I'll talk about vision here briefly. This is a picture of a woman. And when you look at people  your eyes are caught over at two to three times a second. You're not aware of this  but your eyes are always moving. And so when you look at someone's face  you'd typically go from eye to eye to eye to nose to mouth. Now  when your eye moves from eye to eye  if there was something else there like  a nose  you'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be  and you'd go  oh shit  you know    There's something wrong about this person. And that's because you're making a prediction. It's not like you just look over there and say  what am I seeing now  A nose  that's okay. No  you have an expectation of what you're going to see. Every single moment. And finally  let's think about how we test intelligence. We test it by prediction. What is the next word in this  you know  This is to this as this is to this. What is the next number in this sentence  Here's three visions of an object. What's the fourth one  That's how we test it. It's all about prediction. So what is the recipe for brain theory  First of all  we have to have the right framework. And the framework is a memory framework  not a computation or behavior framework. It's a memory framework. How do you store and recall these sequences or patterns  It's spatio temporal patterns. Then  if in that framework  you take a bunch of theoreticians. Now biologists generally are not good theoreticians. It's not always true  but in general  there's not a good history of theory in biology. So I found the best people to work with are physicists  engineers and mathematicians  who tend to think algorithmically. Then they have to learn the anatomy  and they've got to learn the physiology. You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms. Anyone who gets up and tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn't tell you exactly how it's working in the brain and how the wiring works in the brain  it is not a theory. And that's what we're doing at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute. I would love to have more time to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing  and I expect to be back up on this stage  maybe this will be some other time in the not too distant future and tell you about it. I'm really  really excited. This is not going to take    years at all. So what will brain theory look like  First of all  it's going to be a theory about memory. Not like computer memory. It's not at all like computer memory. It's very  very different. And it's a memory of these very high dimensional patterns  like the things that come from your eyes. It's also memory of sequences. You cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence. A song must be heard in sequence over time  and you must play it back in sequence over time. And these sequences are auto associatively recalled  so if I see something  I hear something  it reminds me of it  and then it plays back automatically. It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output. And as I said  the theory must be biologically accurate  it must be testable  and you must be able to build it. If you don't build it  you don't understand it. So  one more slide here. What is this going to result in  Are we going to really build intelligent machines  Absolutely. And it's going to be different than people think. No doubt that it's going to happen  in my mind. First of all  it's going to be built up  we're going to build the stuff out of silicon. The same techniques we use for building silicon computer memories  we can use for here. But they're very different types of memories. And we're going to attach these memories to sensors  and the sensors will experience real live  real world data  and these things are going to learn about their environment. Now it's very unlikely the first things you're going to see are like robots. Not that robots aren't useful and people can build robots. But the robotics part is the hardest part. That's the old brain. That's really hard. The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain. So the first thing we're going to do are the things that don't require a lot of robotics. So you're not going to see C  PO. You're going to more see things like  you know  intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is and what driving is and have learned that certain types of cars with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren't going to turn  things like that. We can also do intelligent security systems. Anywhere where we're basically using our brain  but not doing a lot of mechanics. Those are the things that are going to happen first. But ultimately  the world's the limit here. I don't know how this is going to turn out. I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor and if you talk to them  they knew what they were doing was really significant  but they didn't really know what was going to happen. They couldn't anticipate cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff. They just knew like  hey  they were going to build calculators and traffic light controllers. But it's going to be big. In the same way  this is like brain science and these memories are going to be a very fundamental technology  and it's going to lead to very unbelievable changes in the next     years. And I'm most excited about how we're going to use them in science. So I think that's all my time  I'm over it  and I'm going to end my talk right there. I'd like to start tonight by something completely different  asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.    percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean  and it's where life    the title of our seminar tonight    it's where life began. And it's a lively and a lovely place  but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our    not only with our overfishing  our irresponsible fishing  our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland  but also  most recently  with climate change  and Steve Schneider  I'm sure  will be going into greater detail on this. Now  as we continue to tinker with the oceans  more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low energy type of animals  like jellyfish and bacteria. And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for. Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful  and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday  but they sting like hell  and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up. About     grams of jellyfish equals four calories. So it may be good for the waistline  but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long. And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans  that is  unless you eat jellyfish. And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there  a by the wind sailor. And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish  the Mola mola  whose primary prey are jellyfish. This animal is in  The Guinness World Book of Records  for being the world's heaviest bony fish. It reaches up to almost       pounds    on a diet of jellyfish  primarily. And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola    its common name is sunfish    that its favorite food is the moon jelly. So it's kind of nice  the sun and the moon getting together this way  even if one is eating the other. Now this is typically how you see sunfish  this is where they get their common name. They like to sunbathe  can't blame them. They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they're sick or lazy  but that's a typical behavior  they lie out and bask on the surface. Their other name  Mola mola  is    it sounds Hawaiian  but it's actually Latin for millstone  and that's attributable to their roundish  very bizarre  cut off shape. It's as if  as they were growing  they just forgot the tail part. And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place  was this terribly bizarre shape. You know  you look at sharks  and they're streamlined  and they're sleek  and you look at tuna  and they're like torpedoes    they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength  and then you look at the sunfish. And this is just so elegantly mysterious  it's just    it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say  a tuna. So I was just intrigued with what    you know  what is this animal's story  Well  as with anything in biology  nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution. The Mola's no exception. They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared     million years ago  at a time when whales still had legs  and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction    oblige me a little Kipling esque storytelling here. Of course evolution is somewhat random  and you know  about    million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said  oh  the heck with the coral reefs    we're going to head to the high seas. And lots of generations  lots of tweaking and torquing  and we turn our puffer into the Mola. You know  if you give Mother Nature enough time  that is what she will produce. They look    maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished  abridged perhaps  but in fact  in fact they are the    they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily derived fish in the sea  right up there with flat fish. They're    every single thing about that fish has been changed. And in terms of fishes    fishes appeared     million years ago  and they're pretty modern  just    million years ago  so    so interestingly  they give away their ancestry as they develop. They start as little eggs  and they're in  The Guinness World Book of Records  again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet. A single four foot female had     million eggs  can carry     million eggs in her ovaries    imagine    and they get to be over    feet long. Imagine what a    foot one has. And from that little egg  they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage  reminiscent of their ancestry  and develop    this is their little adolescent stage. They school as adolescents  and become behemoth loners as adults. That's a little diver up there in the corner. They're in  The Guinness World Book of Records  again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world. From their little hatching size of their egg  into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood  they put on     million times an increase in weight.     million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby  and you had to feed this thing. That would mean that your child  you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics. Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but    we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild  but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium    one of the first places to have them in captivity    they had one that gained     lbs in    months. I said  now  that's a true American. So being a loner is a great thing  especially in today's seas  because schooling used to be salvation for fishes  but it's suicide for fishes now. But unfortunately Molas  even though they don't school  they still get caught in nets as by catch. If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination  then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators    how they live their lives  like the Mola. And unfortunately  they make up a large portion of the California by catch    up to    percent of the drift net. And in the Mediterranean  in the swordfish net fisheries  they make up up to    percent. So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives. And how do you do that  How do you do that with an animal    very few places in the world. This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries    it doesn't go to land. How do you get insight  How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets  Well  there's some great new technology that has just recently become available  and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals. And it's pictured right here  that little tag up there. That little tag can record temperature  depth and light intensity  which is correlated with time  and from that we can get locations. And it can record this data for up to two years  and keep it in that tag  release at a pre programmed time  float to the surface  upload all that data  that whole travelogue  to satellite  which relays it directly to our computers  and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have    we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know  sat at our desks. So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them    if you look up here    that's streaming off  that's right where we put the tag. And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola. Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites. They're just parasite hotels  even their parasites have parasites. I think Donne wrote a poem about that. But they have    genera of parasites  and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem. And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment. They don't seem to mind  so far. So what are we trying to find out  We're focusing on the Pacific. We're tagging on the California coast  and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan. And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents  using temperature  using the open ocean  to live their lives. We'd love to tag in Monterey. Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers. Not this time of year    it's more around October. And we'd love to tag here    this is an aerial shot of Monterey    but unfortunately  the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way. The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay  rips off their fins  fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee  Mola style  and then tosses them back and forth. And I'm not exaggerating  it is just    and sometimes they don't eat them  it's just spiteful. And you know  the locals think it's terrible behavior  it's just horrible watching this happen  day after day. The poor little Molas coming in  getting ripped to shreds  so we head down south  to San Diego. Not so many California sea lions down there. And the Molas there  you can find them with a spotter plane very easily  and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp. And under those kelps    this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there. As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp  the exfoliating cleaner fish come. And they come and give the Molas    you can see they strike this funny little position that says   I'm not threatening  but I need a massage.  And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head  and the fish come up and they just clean  clean  clean    because the Molas  you know  there's just a smorgasbord of parasites. And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer  and the Molas are kind of friendly down there. I mean what other kind of fish  if you approach it right  will say   Okay  scratch me right there.  You truly can swim up to a Mola    they're very gentle    and if you approach them right  you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it. So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific  we've gone over to another part of the Pacific  and we've tagged in Taiwan  and we tagged in Japan. And over in these places  the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries. And they're not thrown back as by catch  they're eaten. We were served a nine course meal of Mola after we tagged. Well  not the one we tagged  And everything from the kidney  to the testes  to the back bone  to the fin muscle to    I think that  s pretty much the whole fish    is eaten. So the hardest part of tagging  now  is after you put that tag on  you have to wait  months. And you're just wondering  oh  I hope the fish is safe  I hope  I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording. The tags cost      dollars each  and then satellite time is another     dollars  so you're like  oh  I hope the tag is okay. And so the waiting is really the hardest part. I'm going to show you our latest dataset. And it hasn't been published  so it's totally privy information just for TED. And in showing you this  you know  when we're looking at this data  we're thinking  oh do these animals  do they cross the equator  Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other  And we found that they kind of are homebodies. They're not big migrators. This is their track  we deployed the tag off of Tokyo  and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there. And after four months  went up  you know  off of the north part of Japan. And that's kind of their home range. Now that's important  though  because if there's a lot of fishing pressure  that population doesn't get replenished. So that's a very important piece of data. But also what's important is that they're not slacker  lazy fish. They're super industrious. And this is a day in the life of a Mola  and if we    they're up and down  and up and down  and up and down  and up and up and down  up to    times a day. As the sun comes up  you see in the blue  they start their dive. Down    and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper  little deeper. They plumb the depths down to     meters  in temperatures to one degree centigrade  and this is why you see them on the surface    it's so cold down there. They've got to come up  warm  get that solar power  and then plunge back into the depths  and go up and down and up and down. And they're hitting a layer down there  it's called the deep scattering layer    which a whole variety of food's in that layer. So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker  they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature. We see the same pattern    now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes  manta rays  tunas  a real three dimensional play. This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life  where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that. And what's exciting    you all travel  and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals  and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge. Well now with the Census of Marine Life  we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore    percent of our living space  with local knowledge. It's never    it's really never been a more exciting  or a vital time  to be a biologist. Which brings me to my last point  and what I think is kind of the most fun. I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish. And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered  and I'd be able to thank my funders  like National Geographic and Lindbergh. But people would write into the site with all sorts of  all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis. And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared    a shared love and an interest in the oceans. I was getting reports from Catholic nuns  Jewish Rabbis  Muslims  Christians    everybody writing in  united by their love of life. And to me that    I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself   One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.  And sure  it may be just one big old silly fish  but it's helping. If it's helping to unite the world  I think it's definitely the fish of the future. What I'm going to show you first  as quickly as I can  is some foundational work  some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon  and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. We're looking at many  many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in  panning through it  rearranging it in any way we want. And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at  how big these collections are or how big the images are. Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos  but this one  for example  is a scan from the Library of Congress  and it's in the     megapixel range. It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture. This is an entire book  so this is an example of non image data. This is  Bleak House  by Dickens. Every column is a chapter. To prove to you that it's really text  and not an image  we can do something like so  to really show that this is a real representation of the text  it's not a picture. Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e book. I wouldn't recommend it. This is a more realistic case  an issue of The Guardian. Every large image is the beginning of a section. And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper  which is an inherently multi scale kind of medium. We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution    much higher than in an ordinary ad    and we've embedded extra content. If you want to see the features of this car  you can see it here. Or other models  or even technical specifications. And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. We hope that this means no more pop ups and other rubbish like that    shouldn't be necessary. Of course  mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this. And this one I really won't spend any time on  except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. But those are all the roads in the U.S. superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. So let's pull up  now  something else. This is actually live on the Web now  you can go check it out. This is a project called Photosynth  which marries two different technologies. One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Snavely  a graduate student at the University of Washington  co advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A very nice collaboration. And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. You can see that when we do these sorts of views  where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi resolution experience. But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots    all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies    all these shots were taken. So you see elements here of stabilized slide show or panoramic imaging  and these things have all been related spatially. I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. Some are much more spatial. I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data sets    this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer    to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology  It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website. We had to worry about the lawyers and so on. This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. You just type Notre Dame into Flickr  and you get some pictures of guys in T shirts  and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. And so these are all Flickr images  and they've all been related spatially in this way. We can just navigate in this very simple way. You know  I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here. I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras  it's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRs  quite a large number of them  stitched together in this environment. If I can find some of the sort of weird ones    So many of them are occluded by faces  and so on. Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs    here we go. This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment. What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody    from the entire collective memory  visually  of what the Earth looks like    and link all of that together. Those photos become linked  and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it  and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. Their own photos are getting tagged with meta data that somebody else entered. If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are  then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data  and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space  into that meta verse  using everybody else's photos  and do a kind of a cross modal and cross user social experience that way. And of course  a by product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth  collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on  but from the collective memory. Thank you so much. Chris Anderson  Do I understand this right  What your software is going to allow  is that at some point  really within the next few years  all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together  BAA  Yes. What this is really doing is discovering  creating hyperlinks  if you will  between images. It's doing that based on the content inside the images. And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have. Like when you do a web search for images  you type in phrases  and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. What if that picture links to all of your pictures  The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect. CA  Truly incredible. Congratulations. I'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it. Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk. Shortly after I saw that  we had some friends over for dinner with the family. The conversation turned to global warming  and everybody agreed  there's a real problem. We've got a climate crisis. So  we went around the table to talk about what we should do. The conversation came to my    year old daughter  Mary. She said   I agree with everything that's been said. I'm scared and I'm angry.  And then she turned to me and said   Dad  your generation created this problem  you'd better fix it.  Wow. All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me. I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is   There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.  And we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences  we must act  and we must act decisively. I've got to tell you  for me  everything changed that evening. And so  my partners and I  we set off on this mission to learn more  to try to do much more. So  we mobilized. We got on airplanes. We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India  to Bentonville  Arkansas  to Washington  D.C. and to Sacramento. And so  what I'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys. Because the more we learned  the more concerned we grew. You know  my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers  and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine  we just get together the smartest people we know. For this climate crisis  we assembled a network  really  of superstars  from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders. Fifty or so of them. And so  I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons I've learned in the last year. The first lesson is that companies are really powerful  and that matters a lot. This is a story about how Wal Mart went green  and what that means. Two years ago  the CEO  Lee Scott  believed that green is the next big thing  and so Wal Mart made going green a top priority. They committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by    percent  and their new stores by    percent  and do all that in seven years. The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning  then lighting  and then refrigeration. So  look what they did. They painted the roofs of all their stores white. They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands. And  third  they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with LED lighting. I mean  why would you try to refrigerate a whole store  These are really simple  smart solutions based on existing technology. Why does Wal Mart matter  Well  it's massive. They're the largest private employer in America. They're the largest private user of electricity. They have the second largest vehicle fleet on the road. And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains         suppliers. If Wal Mart were a country  it would be the sixth largest trading partner with China. And maybe most important  they have a big effect on other companies. When Wal Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable  it has a powerful impact on other great institutions. So  let me tell you this  when Wal Mart achieves    percent energy reductions  that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough. We need Wal Mart and every other company to do the same. The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter  and they matter enormously. I've got another Wal Mart story for you  OK  Wal Mart has over     million U.S. customers. That's a third of the U.S. population.    million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. And Wal Mart has committed they're going to sell another     million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy. Consumers don't really like these light bulbs. The light's kind of funny  they won't dim  takes a while for them to start up. But the pay off is really enormous.     million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we'll save     million dollars in energy bills  and    million tons of CO  every year  year in and year out. It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing. It is stupid that we use two tons of steel  glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall. It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here. It's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know  Do you know how much CO  you generated to drive here or fly here  I don't know  and I should. Those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were. But as long as we pretend that CO  is free  as long as these uses are nearly invisible  how can we expect change  I'm really afraid  because I think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough. The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters. In fact  policy is paramount. I've got a behind the scenes story for you about that green tech network I described. At the end of our first meeting  we got together to talk about what the action items would be  how we'd follow up. And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up. You know  Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase. Well  Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento  California that we need a market based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. It's necessary and  just as important  it's good for the California economy. So  eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB  . You know what  Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill  so it passed  and it passed by a vote of    to   . Please. Thank you. I think it's the most important legislation of     . Why  Because California was the first state in this country to mandate    percent reduction of greenhouse gases by     . And the result of that is  we're going to generate        new jobs  four billion dollars a year in annual income  and reduce the CO  emissions by     million tons a year. California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO  emissions. It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO  emissions. It's a great start  but I've got to tell you    where I started    I'm really afraid. In fact  I'm certain California's not enough. Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from. You know Tom Friedman says   If you don't go  you don't know   Well  we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg. He's the father of the ethanol revolution. He told us that Brazil's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol. And they mandated that their new vehicles would be flex fuel compatible  right  They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline. And so  here's what's happened in Brazil. They now have        ethanol pumps    this versus     in the U.S.  and a paltry two in California    and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to    percent flex fuel. Compare that to the U.S.  five percent are flex fuel. And you know what  Most consumers who have them don't even know it. So  what's happened in Brazil is  they've replaced    percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol. That's    billion dollars since      that they didn't ship to the Middle East. It's created a million jobs inside that country  and it's saved    million tons of CO . It's really substantial. That's    percent of the CO  emissions across their entire country. But Brazil's only  .  percent of the world's CO  emission. So  Brazil's ethanol miracle  I'm really afraid  is not enough. In fact  I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. The fourth and final lesson we've learned is about the potential of radical innovation. So  I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology. Every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease. That's malaria.       people a day. All for want of two dollars' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore. Well  two dollars  two dollars is too much for Africa. So  a team of Berkeley researchers with    million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering  designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient  called artemisinin  and they're going to make that drug    times cheaper. And in doing so  they'll save a million lives    at least a million lives a year. A million lives. Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology. This leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products. Now  what you do is  you get inside the microbe  you change its metabolic pathways  and you end up with a living chemical factory. Now  you may ask  John  what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis  Well  I'll tell you    a lot. We've now formed a company called Amyris  and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels. Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal. That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way. So  if all goes well  they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels. I guess that's better living through bugs. Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it. And  of course  at Kleiner we  kind of  apologize and say the second best way is to finance it. And that's why we're investing     million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies. And we're encouraging others to do it as well. We're talking a lot about this. In       there were     million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in      to  .  billion dollars. But I'm really afraid we need much  much more. For reference  fact one  Exxon's revenues in      were a billion dollars a day. Do you know  they only invested  .  percent of revenues in R D  Second fact  the President's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total. Less than one day of Exxon's revenues. Third fact  I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years. And the federal budget calls for a measly    million dollars of R D in geothermal energy. It is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country. And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough. So  in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises. Who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green  Who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation  Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in South America  And who would have thought that scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels  And who would have thought that all that is not enough  Not enough to stabilize the climate. Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean. The scientists tell us    and they're only guessing    that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half  and do it as fast as possible. Now  we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.  but I've got to tell you  we've got only one atmosphere  and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China. To size the problem  China's CO  emissions today are  .  gigatons  the U.S. is  . . Business as usual means we'll have    gigatons from China by     . That's about as much CO  as there is in the whole world. And if it's business as usual  we're going out of business. When I was in Davos  China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO  strategy  and he said the following   You know  Americans use seven times the CO  per capita as Chinese.  Then he asked   Why should China sacrifice our growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid   Does anybody here have an answer for him  I don't. We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome  the profitable outcome  and therefore the likely outcome. Energy's a six trillion dollar business worldwide. It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet  Well  I'll tell you what. Green technologies    going green    is bigger than the Internet. It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the   st century. Moreover  if we succeed  it's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since  as Bill Joy says  we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere. Now  here's the hard question  if the trajectory of all the world's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough  what are we going to do  I don't know. Everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another. So  our call to action    my call to you    is for you to make going green your next big thing  your gig. What can you do  You can personally get carbon neutral. Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating  lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions. There's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed. And the most important thing you can do  I think  is to use your personal power and your Rolodex to lead your business  your institution  in going green. Do it like Wal Mart  get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself. Really think outside the box. Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen  It could be bigger than Wal Mart. I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis. And I really  really hope that we multiply all of our energy  all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem. Because if we do  I can look forward to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in    years. Thank you very much  Chris. Everybody who came up here said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared  but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this. And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at. There are no slides  so you'll just have to be content with me. What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa. Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time  the Africa of HIV AIDS  the Africa of malaria  the Africa of poverty  the Africa of conflict  and the Africa of disasters. While it is true that those things are going on  there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. And sometimes I'm puzzled  and I ask myself why. This is the Africa that is changing  that Chris alluded to. This is the Africa of opportunity. This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies. And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this. That's what I want to talk about today. And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa. On   th of September       Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha  a governor of one of the oil rich states of Nigeria  was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London. He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family. This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria    led by one of our most able and courageous people  Mr. Nuhu Ribadu. Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London. Due to some slip ups  he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where  according to our constitution  those in office as governors  president    as in many countries    have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened  people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office. Today  Alams    as we call him for short    is in jail. This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders. This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good  and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite. And therefore  when you hear about the corrupt Africa    corruption all the time    I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries  and that some successes are emerging. Does it mean the problem is over  The answer is no. There's still a long way to go  but that there's a will there. And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight. So when you hear about corruption  don't just feel that nothing is being done about this    that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case. There's a will to fight  and in many countries  that fight is ongoing and is being won. In others  like mine  where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria  the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go. But the truth of the matter is that this is going on. The results are showing  independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption  and governance is improving. A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in    African countries. And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance. That is that people talk about corruption  corruption. All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa. That's the image  African countries. But let me say this  if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London    if the other people who had taken money  estimated at    to    billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries    if they're able to do this  what is that  Is that not corruption  In this country  if you receive stolen goods  are you not prosecuted  So when we talk about this kind of corruption  let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe    where the money's going and what can be done to stop it. I'm working on an initiative now  along with the World Bank  on asset recovery  trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad    developing countries' moneys    to get that sent back. Because if we can get the    billion dollars sitting out there back  it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together. The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform. Africans  after    they're tired  we're tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care. We are grateful  but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform. And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it. We can invite partners who can support us  but we have to start. We have to reform our economies  change our leadership  become more democratic  be more open to change and to information. And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent  Nigeria. In fact  if you're not in Nigeria  you're not in Africa. I want to tell you that. One in four sub Saharan Africans is Nigerian  and it has     million dynamic people    chaotic people    but very interesting people. You'll never be bored. What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves. And with the support of a leader who was willing  at the time  to do the reforms  we put forward a comprehensive reform program  which we developed ourselves. Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank  where I worked for    years and rose to be a vice president. No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself. We put together a program that would  one  get the state out of businesses it had nothing    it had no business being in. The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent. So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises. We    as a result  we decided to liberalize many of our markets. Can you believe that prior to this reform    which started at the end of       when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister    we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop       landlines in its entire    year history  Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury. You couldn't get it. You had to bribe. You had to do everything to get your phone. When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector  we went from       landlines to    million GSM lines  and counting. Nigeria's telecoms market is the second fastest growing in the world  after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms. And nobody knows  except a few smart people. The smartest one  first to come in  was the MTN company of South Africa. And in the three years that I was Finance Minister  they made an average of     million dollars profit per year.     million in a market    in a country that is a poor country  with an average per capita income just under     dollars per capita. So the market is there. When they kept this under wraps  but soon others got to know. Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies  and three or four others have come in. But there's a huge market out there  and people don't know about it  or they don't want to know. So privatization is one of the things we've done. The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better. Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well. And Nigeria  with the oil sector  had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well. So what did we try to do  We introduced a fiscal rule that de linked our budget from the oil price. Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in  because oil is the biggest  most revenue earning sector in the economy     percent of our revenues come from oil. We de linked that  and once we did it  we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price. We didn't know we could pull it off  it was very controversial. But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development    where  even if oil prices were high  we would grow very fast. When they crashed  we crashed. And we could hardly even pay anything  any salaries  in the economy. That smoothened out. We were able to save  just before I left     billion dollars. Whereas    and this went to our reserves    when I arrived in       we had seven billion dollars in reserves. By the time I left  we had gone up to almost    billion dollars. And as we speak now  we have about    billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances. And that shores up our economy  makes it stable. Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy. We brought inflation down from    percent to about    percent. And we had GDP grow from an average of  .  percent the previous decade to about  .  percent now. So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy. And what is more important  because we want to get away from oil and diversify    and there are so many opportunities in this one big country  as in many countries in Africa    what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone  but from non oil. Agriculture grew at better than eight percent. As telecoms sector grew  housing and construction  and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro economy straightened out  the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous. We have opportunities in agriculture  like I said. We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible  that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world. We have opportunities in housing and real estate. There was nothing in a country of     million people    no shopping malls as you know them here. This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people. And now  we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected. So  huge things in construction  real estate  mortgage markets. Financial services  we had    banks. Too many not doing their real business. We consolidated them from    to    banks by requiring that they increase their capital    share capital. And it went from about    million dollars to     million dollars. The banks    these banks are now consolidated  and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside. Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in     million. Standard Chartered has brought in     million. And I can go on. Dollars  on and on  into the system. We are doing the same with the insurance sector. So in financial services  a great deal of opportunity. In tourism  in many African countries  a great opportunity. And that's what many people know East Africa for  the wildlife  the elephants  and so on. But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important. So what am I trying to say  I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. A new wave of openness and democratization in which  since       more than two thirds of African countries have had multi party democratic elections. Not all of them have been perfect  or will be  but the trend is very clear. I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years  the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about  .  percent to about five percent per annum. This is better than the performance of many OECD countries. So it's clear that things are changing. Conflicts are down on the continent  from about    conflicts a decade ago  we are down to three or four conflicts    one of the most terrible  of course  of which is Darfur. And  you know  you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent  it looks like the entire continent is affected. But you should know that this continent is not    is a continent of many countries  not one country. And if we are down to three or four conflicts  it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable  growing  exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity. And I want to just make one point about this investment. The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet. And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs. There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine. But imagine the impact on a family  if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school  that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves. If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet  isn't that a wonderful opportunity  Isn't that the way to go  And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time. Otherwise  I would have liked you to have seen this. It says   Africa  Open for Business.  And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year. Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania  where they're having the session in June. But it shows you Africans  and particularly African women  who against all odds have developed businesses  some of them world class. One of the women in this video  Adenike Ogunlesi  making children's clothes    which she started as a hobby and grew into a business. Mixing African materials  such as we have  with materials from elsewhere. So  she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys  with African material mixed in. Very creative designs  has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal Mart. For        pieces. So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing. And the women are diligent. They are focused  they work hard. I could go on giving examples  Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda  who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing     other women and men to work with her. However  many of these are starved for capital to expand  because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market. Nobody thinks there's opportunity. But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now  will miss it forever. So if you want to be in Africa  think about investing. Think about the Beatrices  think about the Adenikes of this world  who are doing incredible things  that are bringing them into the global economy  whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed  and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income. So I invite you to explore the opportunities. When you go to Tanzania  listen carefully  because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent  for the people and for yourselves. Thank you very much. So  I kind of believe that we're in like the  cave painting  era of computer interfaces. Like  they're very kind of    they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. Hit me. OK. So I mean  this is the kind of status quo interface  right  It's very flat  kind of rigid. And OK  so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac  you know  but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last  you know     years. Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers. I mean it's point and click  it's like the menus  icons  it's all the kind of same thing. And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk. It's so much more subtle  so much more visceral    you know  what's visible  what's not. And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop. So I kind of have a    this is BumpTop. It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. So you can bump things    they're all physically  you know  manipulable and stuff. And instead of that point and click  it's like a push and pull  things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk  I can    let me just grab these guys    I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid  or you know  flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. When they're laid out  I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile  you know  just immediately  right  And then  it's all smoothly animated  instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces. Also  if I want to add something to a pile  well  how do I do that  I just toss it to the pile  and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. Also some of the stuff we can do is  for these individual icons we thought    I mean  how can we play with the idea of an icon  and push that further  And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important. But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this  it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys  right  So it's cute  but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information  right  This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool. Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared  because it has a lot of  I think  valuable properties. And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. So one of the things you can do to our icons  just like paper  is crease them and fold them  just like paper. Remember  you know  something for later. Or if you want to be destructive  you can just crumple it up and  you know  toss it to the corner. Also just like paper  around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later  and I can do the same thing here  and you know  you'll see post it notes and things like that around people's offices. And I can pull them off when I want to work with them. So  one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that  you know   Okay  well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer.  So one thing we have for that is like a grid align  kind of    so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. More boring  but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping. And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. Let's just break this shelf. Okay  that shelf broke. I think beyond the icons  I think another really cool domain for this software    I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop    but browsing photographs. I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of  you know  photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable    and you know I can double click on something to take a look at it. And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before. So I can pile things up  I can flip through it  I can  you know    okay  let's move this photo to the back  let's delete this guy here  and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information. And that's BumpTop. Thanks  Thank you. And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me. I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra  an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area  Vaishali  and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him. All the young people  actually  from the city. The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha  because when he came to their city he accepted    he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him  from whoever it is  and the local geisha  a movie star sort of person  raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first. So he was hanging out with the movie star  and of course they were grumbling   He's supposed to be religious and all this. What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his     monks   and so on. They were all grumbling  and so they boycotted him. They wouldn't go listen to him. But the young people all came. And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol  and they put it on the ground. And as soon as they had laid all these  all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India  he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium  the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that  and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes. And of course  in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it  and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets. So they don't    when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky    they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding. They actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that. He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected. And then Leilei    I know his other name    told us about interconnection  and how we're all totally interconnected here  and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe  we've already done this already billions of times in many  many lifetimes in the past. And I didn't give the talk always. You did  and we had to watch you  and so forth. And we're all still trying to  I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters  if that's a modern form of enlightenment. I guess so. Because in a way  if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything  it's the forging of a mass awareness  of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet. And therefore it will become intolerable    what compassion is  is where it will become intolerable for us  totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is  and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place  or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth. It just becomes intolerable. With all of us knowing everything  we're kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something  to become enlightened. And of course  we all will be deeply disappointed when we do. Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do  a little bit tired  we do suffer. We do enjoy our misery in a certain way. We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere  but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other  and each one tries to get out of their own  and ultimately it fails of course  and then we're back into this thing. Because our egocentric perception    from the Buddha's point of view  misperception    is that all we are is what is inside our skin. And it's inside and outside  self and other  and other is all very different. And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception  a little bit  right  You know  someone sitting next to you in a seat    that's OK because you're in a theater  but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you  you'd freak out. What do they want from me  Like  who's that  And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe    that's all Buddha discovered. Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone  each of us  and everyone else is different  then that puts us in an impossible situation  doesn't it  Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world  Who's going to get enough out of the world  Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings    if you're different from all the other beings  So where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way  through art  through meditation  through understanding  through knowledge actually  knowing that you have no such boundary  knowing your interconnectedness with other beings. You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them. When you do that  you're forced to feel what they feel. Luckily  they say    I still am not sure    but luckily  they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature  they say   Oh who would really want to be compassionate  How awful  I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching. My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied. I never have enough  even if I'm a billionaire  I don't have enough. I need a hundred billion.  So I'm like that. Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering. It would be terrible. But apparently  this is a strange paradox of life. When you're no longer locked in yourself  and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world  that enables you to let your mind spread out  and empathize  and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing  and realizing that you are the other being  somehow by that opening  you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can  you get away from this terrible iron circle of I  me  me  mine  like the Beatles used to sing. You know  we really learned everything in the '  s. Too bad nobody ever woke up to it  and they've been trying to suppress it since then. I  me  me  mine. It's like a perfect song  that song. A perfect teaching. But when we're relieved from that  we somehow then become interested in all the other beings. And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange. It's totally strange. The Dalai Lama always likes to say    he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion  it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence. It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that  or what  you know    and the more you focus on how you feel  by the way  the worse it gets. Like  even when you're having a good time  when is the good time over  The good time is over when you think  how good is it  And then it's never good enough. I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time  doing it by having a good time. I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that. He once told me    he looked kind of sad  he worries very much about the haves and have nots. He looked a little sad  because he said  well  a hundred years ago  they went and took everything away from the haves. You know  the big communist revolutions  Russia and China and so forth. They took it all away by violence  saying they were going to give it to everyone  and then they were even worse. They didn't help at all. So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today  And so then he looks at me. So I said   Well  you know  you're all in this yourself. You teach  it's generosity   was all I could think of. What is virtue  But of course  what you said  I think the key to saving the world  the key to compassion is that it is more fun. It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key. Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring  and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly. Even though his people are being genocided    and believe me  he feels every blow on every old nun's head  in every Chinese prison. He feels it. He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays. I won't even say what they do. But he feels it. And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly. Because when you open up like that  then you can't just    what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery  You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is  how it can be changed. Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man. She scared us with the lava man is coming  then the tsunami is coming  but then finally there were flowers and trees  and it was very beautiful. It's really lovely. So  compassion means to feel the feelings of others  and the human being actually is compassion. The human being is almost out of time. The human being is compassion because what is our brain for  Now  Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac. But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is  he will  he did. He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings. And he would have tremendous fun doing that. So the first person who gets happy  when you stop focusing on the self centered situation of  how happy am I  where you're always dissatisfied    as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way. So then you decide   Well  I'm sick of myself. I'm going to think of how other people can be happy. I'm going to get up in the morning and think  what can I do for even one other person  even a dog  my dog  my cat  my pet  my butterfly   And the first person who gets happy when you do that  you don't do anything for anybody else  but you get happier  you yourself  because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it. And you realize that this    being with these people    is the flower garden that Chiho showed us. It is Nirvana. And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments. Thank you. Kurt Andersen  Like many architects  David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent    or at least pretends to be    that he asked me to question him rather than speaking. In fact what we're going to talk about  I think  is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address. And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede. Dan Rather  Since the September   th attack on the World Trade Center  many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the    acre burial ground. Now  as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports  they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene. Jim Axelrod  Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest    Ground Zero. Tourist  I've taken my step daughter here from Indianapolis. This was    out of all the tourist sites in New York City    this was her number one pick. JA  Thousands now line up on lower Broadway. Tourist  I've been wanting to come down here since this happened. JA  Even on the coldest winter days. To honor and remember. Tourist  It's reality  it's us. It happened here. This is ours. JA  So many  in fact  that seeing has become a bit of a problem. Tourist  I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on. JA  But that is about to change. In record time  a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer. Man  They'll get an incredible panorama and understand  I think more completely  the sheer totality of the destruction of the place. JA  If you think about it  Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument  people come here to see what's no longer there. David Rockwell  The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground. JA  The walls are bare by design  so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter. Tourist  From our hearts  it affected us just as much. JA  The ramps are made of simple material    the kind of plywood you see at construction sites    which is really the whole point. In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again. Jim Axelrod  CBS News  New York. KA  This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment  but certainly David you are known as    I know  a phrase you hate    an entertainment architect. Your work is highly sensual  even hedonistic. DR  I like that word. KA  It's about pleasure    casinos and hotels and restaurants. How did the shock that all of us    and especially all of us in New York    felt on the   th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing  DR  Well the truth of the matter is  post September   th  I felt myself in the role originally    first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated  and as someone who works less than a mile from there    that I was in the role of forcing     people who work with me in my firm  to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. In fact we're finishing a book which is called  Pleasure   which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. But I've got to tell you    it became impossible to do that. We were really paralyzed. And I found myself the Friday after September   th    two days afterwards    literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything. We gave the office a few days off. And in discussing this with other architects  we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were    they should rebuild them    stories taller. And I thought it was astonishing to speculate  as if this were a competition  on something that was such a fresh wound. And I had a series of discussions    first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller  who collaborated with us on this  and several other people    and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. And that as people who create places  the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios  but to help right now. So we tried to come up with a way  as a group  to have a kind of design SWAT team. And that was the mission that we came up with. KA  Were you conscious of suddenly    as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants    suddenly fulfilling needs  DR  Well what I was aware of was  there was this overwhelming need to act now. And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this. There was a school  PS      that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. They moved to an abandoned school. We took about    or    architects and designers and artists  and over four days    it was like this urban barn raising    to renovate it  and everyone wanted to help. It was just extraordinary. Tom Otterness contributed  Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us. KA  And that was done  effectively  by October   or something  DR  Yeah. KA  Obviously  what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project    and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site    you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine  entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics. DR  Well  it's a funny thing. We finished PS      and had dinner with a small group. I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild. And I sat in on several meetings. And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled  and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process. And it wasn't an inclusive group. So we said  what is    KA  It was not an inclusive group  DR  It was not an inclusive group. It was predominantly a white  rich  corporate group that was not representative of the city. KA  Shocking. DR  Yeah  surprising. So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. The city actually approached us. We first approached the city about Pier   . We saw how PS     worked. The families    the victims of the families    were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing. KA  On the Hudson River  DR  Yeah. And the city actually    through Tim Zagat initially  and then through Christyne Nicholas  then we got to Giuliani    said   You know we don't want to do anything with Pier    right now  but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families  and a way to protect it from the weather.  So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin  and I've got to say  it was the most moving experience of my life. It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it  where the families of the victims had left notes to them. And there was no mediation between us and the experience. There was no filter. And I remembered on September   th  on   th Street  the roof of our building    we can see the World Trade Towers prominently    and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. And then everyone was up on the roof  so I ran up there. And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience. So seeing this in a very simple  dignified way was a very powerful experience. So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform  but we've spent some time down there. At the same time the city had this need. They were looking for a solution to deal with    or    thousand people a day who were going down there  that had nowhere to go. And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. There was a way    there had to be a way    to get people to move around the site. KA  But then you've got to figure out a way    we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board    but simply funding this thing. It looks like a fairly simple thing  but this was a half a million dollar project  DR  Well  we knew that if it wasn't privately funded  it wasn't going to happen. And we also  frankly  knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration  then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the    we were meeting with    or    people with the city at a time  and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. This incredible act on their part  because they really wanted this  and they sensed that this needed to happen. KA  And there was therefore this ticking clock  because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that. DR  Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this    we had to work with the families of the victims  through the city  to make sure that they knew this was happening. Because this didn't want to be a surprise. And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York  because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible. We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation  mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this  he would not agree to do this  even if we would pay him the money. There needed to be a foundation in place. So we came up with a foundation  and actually what happened was one major developer in New York    KA  Who shall remain nameless  I guess  DR  Yeah. His initials are JS  and he owns Rockefeller Center  if that helps anyone    volunteered to help. And we met with him. The prices from the contractors were between five to         dollars. And Atlantic Heydt  who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country  volunteered to do it at cost. So this developer said   You know what  we'll underwrite the entire expense.  And we said   That's incredible   And I think this was the   st  and we knew this had to be built and up by the   th. And we had to start construction the next day. We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice  and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it. KA  Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge  I guess  DR  In fact  it was as if this was going to be window washing scaffolding. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul    that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified  and a place to reflect and remember. And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together  watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul    which is just to the right    and moving around the site. And I live down there  so we spent a lot of time looking at the need. And I think people were amazed at two things    I think they were amazed at the destruction  but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said   I'm going to lock the door  because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.  And we said   Well  this is half the size  it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone    everyone in the city. We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.  And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed. The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. So we didn't know what to do  but we decided to cast a very wide net. We emailed out letters to as many people as we could    several people in the audience here    who were very helpful. KA  There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point  DR  No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. He had already ordered materials based on my go ahead. We knew that one way or another this was going to happen. And we just felt it had to happen. KA  You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation. Richard  I think very correctly  made the point at the beginning    before all the chair designers came out    about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal  banal  common problem of sitting. It seems to me with this  that it was the opposite of that. This was an unprecedented  singular design problem. DR  Well here's the issue  we knew that this was not in the sense of    we think about the site  and think about the need for a memorial. It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. That this was a place for people to reflect  to remember    a kind of quiet place. So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer    as we said about the families' platform    and the experience as possible. It's all incredibly humble material. It's scaffolding and plywood. And it allows    by sort of the procession of the movement  up by Saint Paul's and down the other side    it gives you about     feet to go up    feet from the ground to where you get the     degree view. But the design was driven by a need to be quick  cheap  safe  respectful  flexible. One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site  one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform  we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions  and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is. KA  Your work    I mean  we've talked about this before    a lot of your work  I think  is informed by your belief in  or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things  and a kind of  Eat  drink  and be merry  for tomorrow we die   sort of sense of existence. This is clearly not a work for the ages. You know  a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. Did that require  as an architect  a new way of thinking about what you were doing  To think of it as this purely temporary installation  DR  No  I don't think so. I think this is  obviously  substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before  just by the nature of it. Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is  number one    the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. And Kevin Kennon  Rick Scofidio  Liz Diller and all the people within the city    Norman Lear  who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding  offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it. So the notion of collaboration    I think this reinforces how important that is. And in terms of the temporary nature of it  our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be. I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city  about what's really happening there. And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address  where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. Which was very controversial  but it resonated with a lot of people. And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used  having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter  I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. And that's what we were interested in. So that  very much  is in the realm of things I've been interested in before. KA  It seems to me  among other things  a lovely piece of civic infrastructure. It enables that conversation to get serious. And six months after the fact    and only a few months away from the site being cleaned    we are very quickly  now  getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. Do you have    having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project    have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done  DR  Well  I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate    I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan. The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings  which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings. KA  But it had some really terrible ideas. DR  And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas  where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses. And I think there should be a broader    which there's starting to be    the dialogue is really opening up to  what does this site really want to be  And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out  that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive  about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over  so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land. KA  Well  I think that's interesting. And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago  but perhaps isn't now  which is  not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture  as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza. Is this an opportunity  is the silver lining    a silver lining  here    to rebuild some more traditional city grid  or not  DR  I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day  I don't think it has much to do with    or    or    or    thousand new office spaces  regardless of what the number is. So yeah  I think there is a chance to re look at how we think about cities. And in fact  there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven. KA  Which was the building just north of the Towers  DR  Right  which the towers fell into. And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city. I think a public dialogue    I think  you know  I'd like to see an international competition  and a call for ideas for uses. KA  Whether it's arts  whether it's housing  whether it's what amount of shopping  DR  Right. And we're looking for other things. This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help. Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting    architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing. And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic  single solutions  and more about a multiplicity of things. KA  Before we end  I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform  DR  John Kamen    who's here  actually    put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use. So I thought that would be good to end with. DR  We're looking from Fulton Street  west. One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti graffiti he was. And essentially our structure was designed to be written on. KA  As you say  it's not a memorial. But were you conscious of memorials  The Vietnam Memorial  Those kinds of forms  DR  We certainly did as much research as we could  and we were conscious of other memorials. And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do. It's     people on the committee for Oklahoma City  which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad hoc  spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad hoc memorials in the city already. The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de mountable. What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed  so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero  but all of the buildings around it    and the scars on the building around it  which are enormous. This shows Saint Paul's on the left. KA  I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection  and its being there  almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished  is part of its extraordinary    I don't know if beauty is the word    but presence. DR  It was an honor to do. And we were thrilled to be able to show it here. I get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical Pentagon long range strategic planners. And the answer I like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war. And what I've spent    years doing in this business    and it's taken me almost    to figure it out    is I think about the future of wars in the context of everything else. So I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace. The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas. It's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit. The material was generated in two years of work I did for the Secretary of Defense  thinking about a new national grand strategy for the United States. I'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer. Here's my favorite bonehead concept from the     s in the Pentagon  the theory of anti access  area denial asymmetrical strategies. Why do we call it that  Because it's got all those A's lined up I guess. This is gobbledygook for if the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge. They're going to be small. And if they try to fight us in the traditional  straight up manner we're going to kick their ass  which is why people don't try to do that any more. I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat. He's now a one star General. That's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours. So that overmatched capability creates problems    catastrophic successes the White House calls them. And we're trying to figure that out  because it is an amazing capability. The question is  what's the good you can do with it  OK  The theory of anti access  area denial asymmetrical strategies    gobbledygook that we sell to Congress  because if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses they wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want. So we say  area denial  anti access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over. And they say   Will you build it in my district   Here's my parody and it ain't much of one. Let's talk about a battle space. I don't know  Taiwan Straits     . Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space. I don't know  the Million Man Swim. The United States has to access that battle space instantaneously. They throw up anti access  area denial asymmetrical strategies. A banana peel on the tarmac. Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly. We say   China  it's yours.  Prometheus approach  largely a geographic definition  focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict. We field the first half team in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game. That's the problem. We can run the score up against anybody  and then get our asses kicked in the second half    what they call fourth generation warfare. Here's the way I like to describe it instead. There is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access. They said we couldn't do Afghanistan. We did it with ease. They said we couldn't do Iraq. We did it with     combat casualties in six weeks. We did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse. There is nobody we can't take down. The question is  what do you do with the power  So there's no trouble accessing battle spaces. What we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow  and creating the peace space that allows us to move on. Problem is  the Defense Department over here beats the hell out of you. The State Department over here says   Come on boy  I know you can make it.  And that poor country runs off that ledge  does that cartoon thing and then drops. This is not about overwhelming force  but proportional force. It's about non lethal technologies  because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you're going to lose friends very quickly. This is not about projecting power  but about staying power  which is about legitimacy with the locals. Who do you access in this transition space  You have to create internal partners. You have to access coalition partners. We asked the Indians for        peace keepers. I know their senior leadership  they wanted to give it to us. But they said to us   You know what  In that transition space you're mostly hat not enough cattle. We don't think you can pull it off  we're not going to give you our        peace keepers for fodder.  We asked the Russians for       . They said no. I was in China in August  I said   You should have        peace keepers in Iraq. It's your oil  not ours.  Which is the truth. It's their oil. And the Chinese said to me   Dr. Barnett  you're absolutely right. In a perfect world we'd have        there. But it's not a perfect world  and your administration isn't getting us any closer.  But we have trouble accessing our outcomes. We lucked out  frankly  on the selection. We face different opponents across these three. And it's time to start admitting you can't ask the same    year old to do it all  day in and day out. It's just too damn hard. We have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. We don't do the everything else so well. Frankly  we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it. We have a brilliant Secretary of War. We don't have a Secretary of Everything Else. Because if we did  that guy would be in front of the Senate  still testifying over Abu Ghraib. The problem is he doesn't exist. There is no Secretary of Everything Else. I think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. I call that the Leviathan Force. What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else. I call them the System Administrators. What I think this really represents is lack of an A to Z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states. We have one for processing economically bankrupt states. It's the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan  OK  We argue about it every time we use it. Argentina just went through it  broke a lot of rules. They got out on the far end  we said   Fine  don't worry about it.  It's transparent. A certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non zero outcome. We don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that  frankly  everybody wants gone. Like Saddam  like Mugabe  like Kim Jong Il    people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions. Like the         dead so far in Sudan. What would an A to Z system look like  I'm going to distinguish between what I call front half and back half. And let's call this red line  I don't know  mission accomplished. What we have extant right now  at the beginning of this system  is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury. What can they do  They can indict your ass. They can debate it. They can write it on a piece of paper. They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you  and then say in no uncertain terms   Please cut that out.  That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the     s. That gets you         dead in the Sudan in the last    months. Everybody's got to answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in Africa  and you better have an answer. We don't have anything to translate that will into action. What we do have is the U.S. enabled Leviathan Force that says   You want me to take that guy down  I'll take that guy down. I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you    billion dollars.  But here's the deal. As soon as I can't find anybody else to air out  I leave the scene immediately. That's called the Powell Doctrine. Way downstream we have the International Criminal Court. They love to put them on trial. They've got Milosevic right now. What are we missing  A functioning executive that will translate will into action  because we don't have it. Every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing. We haven't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in     . But we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we're a democracy and that's what it takes. And if that doesn't work we scream   He's got a gun   just as we rush in. And then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say   Jesus  it was dark.  Do you want to do it  France  France says   No  but I do like to criticize you after the fact.  What we need downstream is a great power enabled    what I call that Sys Admin Force. We should have had         troops streaming into Iraq on the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad. What do you get then  No looting  no military disappearing  no arms disappearing  no ammo disappearing  no Muqtada al Sadr    I'm wrecking his bones    no insurgency. Talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months. We had six months to feel the lob  to get the job done  and we dicked around for six months. And then they turned on us. Why  Because they just got fed up. They saw what we did to Saddam. They said   You're that powerful  you can resurrect this country. You're America.  What we need is an international reconstruction fund    Sebastian Mallaby  Washington Post  great idea. Model on the IMF. Instead of passing the hat each time  OK  Where are we going to find this guy  G    that's easy. Check out their agenda since     . All security dominated. They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF. You vote according to how much money you put in the kitty. Here's my challenge to the Defense Department. You've got to build this force. You've got to seed this force. You've got to track coalition partners. Create a record of success. You will get this model. You tell me it's too hard to do. I'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans. We did it just like that. I'm talking about regularizing it  making it transparent. Would you like Mugabe gone  Would you like Kim Jong Il  who's killed about two million people  would you like him gone  Would you like a better system  This is why it matters to the military. They've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War. I'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire  which I can do because I'm not inside the beltway. I'm talking about the     s. The Berlin Wall falls. We do Desert Storm. The split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with  and those who see a future that starts to scare them  like the U.S. submarine community  which watches the Soviet Navy disappear overnight. Ah  So they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self discovery and self actualization. The problem is you need a big  sexy opponent to fight against. And if you can't find one you've got to make one up. China  all grown up  going to be a looker  The rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the     s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it  military operations other than war. I ask you  who joins the military to do things other than war  Actually  most of them. Jessica Lynch never planned on shooting back. Most of them don't pick up a rifle. I maintain this is code inside the Army for   We don't want to do this.  They spent the     s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world What I call the core and the gap. The Clinton administration wasn't interested in running this. For eight years  after screwing up the relationship on day one    inauguration day with gays in the military    which was deft. So we were home alone for eight years. And what did we do home alone  We bought one military and we operated another. It's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says   Doctor  it hurts when I do this.  The doctor says   Stop doing that you idiot.  I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early     s. I'd say   You're buying one military and you're operating another  and eventually it's going to hurt. It's wrong. Bad Pentagon  bad   And they'd say   Dr. Barnett  you are so right. Can you come back next year and remind us again   Some people say      heals the rift    jerks the long term transformation gurus out of their        foot view of history  drags them down in to the muck and says   You want a networked opponent  I've got one  he's everywhere  go find him.  It elevates MOOTW    how we pronounce that acronym    from crap to grand strategy  because that's how you're going to shrink that gap. Some people put these two things together and they call it empire  which I think is a boneheaded concept. Empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets  which you cannot do  but maximum rule sets which you must do. It's not our system of governance. Never how we've sought to interact with the outside world. I prefer that phrase System Administration. We enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy. Certain bad things you cannot do. How this impacts the way we think about the future of war. This is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the Pentagon. It makes me very popular as well. Everybody's got an opinion. Going back to the beginning of our country    historically  defenses meant protection of the homeland. Security has meant everything else. Written into our constitution  two different forces  two different functions. Raise an army when you need it  and maintain a navy for day to day connectivity. A Department of War  a Department of Everything Else. A big stick  a baton stick. Can of whup ass  the networking force. In      we merged these two things together in the Defense Department. Our long term rationale becomes  we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets. To attack America is to risk blowing up the world. We connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay. That's not our problem now. They can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow and we don't go to the mattresses with nukes. That's the scary part. The question is how do we reconnect American national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable  and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet  What's happened since is that bifurcation I described. We talked about this going all the way back to the end of the Cold War. Let's have a Department of War  and a Department of Something Else. Some people say   Hell       did it for you.  Now we've got a home game and an away game. The Department of Homeland Security is a strategic feel good measure. It's going to be the Department of Agriculture for the   st century. TSA    thousands standing around. Just be grateful Robert Reed didn't shove that bomb up his ass. Because we'd all be gay then. I supported the war in Iraq. He was a bad guy with multiple priors. It's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him. I knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force. I knew we'd have a hard time with what followed. But I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure. What do I mean by these two different forces  This is the Hobbesian Force. I love this force. I don't want to see it go. That plus nukes rules out great power war. This is the military the rest of the world wants us to build. It's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries. What does this mean  It means you've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same    year old. Switching back  morning  afternoon  evening  morning  afternoon  evening. Handing out aid  shooting back  handing out aid  shooting back. It's too much. The    year olds get tired from the switching  OK  That force on the left  you can train a    year old to do that. That force on the right is more like a    year old cop. You need the experience. What does this mean in terms of operations  The rule is going to be this. That Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home  does most of your work. You break out that Leviathan Force only every so often. But here's the promise you make to the American public  to your own people  to the world. You break out that Leviathan Force  you promise  you guarantee that you're going to mount one hell of a    immediately    follow on Sys Admin effort. Don't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace. Other differences. Leviathan traditional partners  they all look like the Brits and their former colonies. Including us  I would remind you. The rest    wider array of partners. International organizations  non governmental organizations  private voluntary organizations  contractors. You're not going to get away from that. Leviathan Force  it's all about joint operations between the military services. We're done with that. What we need to do is inter agency operations  which frankly Condi Rice was in charge of. And I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed. I call the Leviathan Force your dad's military. I like them young  male  unmarried  slightly pissed off. I call the Sys Admin Force your mom's military. It's everything the man's military hates. Gender balanced much more  older  educated  married with children. The force on the left  up or out. The force on the right  in and out. The force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the U.S. The force on the right's going to obliterate it. That's where the National Guard's going to be. The force on the left is never coming under the purview of the International Criminal Court. Sys Admin Force has to. Different definitions of network centricity. One takes down networks  one puts them up. And you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that. Do we need a bigger budget  Do we need a draft to pull this off  Absolutely not. I've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years  we can do it faster  cheaper  smaller  just as lethal. I say   Great  I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide.  Here's the larger point. You're going to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U.S. Military first. But ultimately you're going to civilianize it  probably two thirds. Inter agency ize it  internationalize it. So yes  it begins inside the Pentagon  but over time it's going to cross that river. I have been to the mountain top. I can see the future. I may not live long enough to get you there  but it's going to happen. We're going to have a Department of Something Else between war and peace. Last slide. Who gets custody of the kids  This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense. And this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk. Read Max Boon. This is the history of the marines    small wars  small arms. The Marines are like my West Highland Terrier. They get up every morning  they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something. I don't want my Marines handing out aid. I want them to be Marines. That's what keeps the Sys Admin Force from being a pussy force. It keeps it from being the U.N. You shoot at these people the Marines are going to come over and kill you. Department of Navy  strategic subs go this way  surface combatants are over there  and the news is they may actually be that small. I call it the Smart Dust Navy. I tell young officers   You may command     ships in your career. Bad news is they may not have anybody on them.  Carriers go both ways because they're a swing asset. You'll see the pattern    airborne  just like carriers. Armor goes this way. Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force  you can win by bombing. But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace. Shinseki was right with the argument. Air force  strategic airlift goes both ways. Bombers  fighters go over here. Special Operations Command down at Tampa. Trigger pullers go this way. Civil Affairs  that bastard child  comes over here. Return to the Army. The point about the trigger pullers and Special Operations Command. No off season  these guys are always active. They drop in  do their business  disappear. See me now. Don't talk about it later. I was never here. The world is my playground. I want to keep trigger pullers trigger happy. I want the rules to be as loose as possible. Because when the thing gets prevented in Chicago with the three million dead that perverts our political system beyond all recognition  these are the guys who are going to kill them first. So it's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that. Reserve component    National Guard reserves overwhelmingly Sys Admin. How are you going to get them to work for this force  Most firemen in this country do it for free. This is not about money. This is about being up front with these guys and gals. Last point  intelligence community    the muscle and the defense agencies go this way. What should be the CIA  open  analytical  open source should come over here. The information you need to do this is not secret. It's not secret. Read that great piece in the New Yorker about how our echo boomers     to     over in Iraq taught each other how to do Sys Admin work  over the Internet in chat rooms. They said   Al Qaeda could be listening.  They said   Well  Jesus  they already know this stuff.  Take a gift in the left hand. These are the sunglasses that don't scare people  simple stuff. Censors and transparency  the overheads go in both directions. Thanks. What I want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds  digital globes  the   D Web  the Metaverse. What does this all mean for us  What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again. It's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world. With graphics  computing power  low latencies  these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives. So the Virtual Earth initiative  and other types of these initiatives  are all about extending our current search metaphor. When you think about it  we're so constrained by browsing the Web  remembering URLs  saving favorites. As we move to search  we rely on the relevance rankings  the Web matching  the index crawling. But we want to use our brain  We want to navigate  explore  discover information. In order to do that  we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat. We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer. So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day  Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life  So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation  comprehensive  of the entire world. What we want to do is mix in all types of data. Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth  global perspective  local knowledge. So when you think about this problem  what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin  Well  we collect data from satellites  from airplanes  from ground vehicles  from people. This process is an engineering problem  a mechanical problem  a logistical problem  an operational problem. Here is an example of our aerial camera. This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones. In addition  it's multi spectral. We collect four gigabits per second of data  if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down. That's equivalent to a constellation of    satellites at highest res capacity. We fly these airplanes at       feet in the air. You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints  vantage points  angles  textures. We bring all that data back in. We sit here    you know  think about the ground vehicles  the human scale    what do you see in person  We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like type experience. I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials  kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity. So a little unknown secret is    did you see the one with the guy  he's got the Web cam  The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him. Well  a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team. But let me tell you    it doesn't affect his day job. We think a lot of good can come from this technology. This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone. We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors  disaster areas. We helped with the first responders  the search and rescue. Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth. We made it all freely available on the Web  just to    it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause. When we think about how all this comes together  it's all about software  algorithms and math. You know  we capture this imagery but to build the   D models we need to do geo positioning. We need to do geo registering of the images. We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points. Extract geometry from the images. This process is a very calculated process. In fact  it was always done manual. Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually. They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR. They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building. We do this all through software  algorithms and math    a highly automated pipeline creating these cities. We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities  and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream. We think about the user interface. What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives  An ortho view  a nadir view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model  I'll wrap up by showing you the    this is a brand new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth. What we're doing is    people like this a lot  this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data. But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the   D model. A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller. So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the   D model space. You can see all types of resolution. From here  I can slowly pan the image over. I can get the next image. I can blend and transition. By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact  I might be recording history. The freshness  the capacity. I can turn this image. I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles. What we're trying to do is build a virtual world. We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with  and really derive insights from you  from all different directions. I thank you very much for your time. I told you three things last year. I told you that the statistics of the world have not been made properly available. Because of that  we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries  which is wrong. And that animated graphics can make a difference. Things are changing and today  on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page  it says  by first of May  full access to the databases. And if I could share the image with you on the screen. So three things have happened. U.N. opened their statistic databases  and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net  so you don't have to download it any longer. And let me repeat what you saw last year. The bubbles are the countries. Here you have the fertility rate    the number of children per woman    and there you have the length of life in years. This is         those were the industrialized countries  those were developing countries. At that time there was a  we  and  them.  There was a huge difference in the world. But then it changed  and it went on quite well. And this is what happens. You can see how China is the red  big bubble. The blue there is India. And they go over all this    I'm going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how things really changed. And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here  doesn't it  Large families still  and the HIV epidemic brought down the countries like this. This is more or less what we saw last year  and this is how it will go on into the future. And I will talk on  is this possible  Because you see now  I presented statistics that don't exist. Because this is where we are. Will it be possible that this will happen  I cover my lifetime here  you know  I expect to live     years. And this is where we are today. Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world  And I would like to show that against child survival. We'll swap the axis. Here you have child mortality    that is  survival    four kids dying there      dying there. And this is GDP per capita on this axis. And this was     . And if I go back in time  I've added some historical statistics    here we go  here we go  here we go    not so much statistics     years ago. Some countries still had statistics. We are looking down in the archive  and when we are down into       there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers. But they were down here. They had       dollars per person per year. And they lost one fifth of their kids before their first birthday. So this is what happens in the world  if we play the entire world. How they got slowly richer and richer  and they add statistics. Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics  You see the importance of that  And here  children don't live longer. The last century        was bad for the kids in Europe  because most of this statistics is Europe. It was only by the turn of the century that more than    percent of the children survived their first year. This is India coming up  with the first data from India. And this is the United States moving away here  earning more money. And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here. And it moves up with Mao Tse Tung getting health  not getting so rich. There he died  then Deng Xiaoping brings money. It moves this way over here. And the bubbles keep moving up there  and this is what the world looks like today. Let us have a look at the United States. We have a function here    I can tell the world   Stay where you are.  And I take the United States    we still want to see the background    I put them up like this  and now we go backwards. And we can see that the United States goes to the right of the mainstream. They are on the money side all the time. And down in       the United States was a neighbor of India    present  contemporary India. And that means United States was richer  but lost more kids than India is doing today  proportionally. And look here    compare to the Philippines of today. The Philippines of today has almost the same economy as the United States during the First World War. But we have to bring United States forward quite a while to find the same health of the United States as we have in the Philippines. About      here  the health of the United States is the same as the Philippines. And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized  is that Asia  Arabic countries  Latin America  are much more ahead in being healthy  educated  having human resources than they are economically. There's a discrepancy in what's happening today in the emerging economies. There now  social benefits  social progress  are going ahead of economical progress. And         the United States had the same economy as Chile has today. And how long do we have to bring United States to get the same health as Chile has today  I think we have to go  there    we have       or         the United States has the same health as Chile. Chile's catching up  Within some years Chile may have better child survival than the United States. This is really a change  that you have this lag of more or less        years' difference on the health. And behind the health is the educational level. And there's a lot of infrastructure things  and general human resources are there. Now we can take away this    and I would like to show you the rate of speed  the rate of change  how fast they have gone. And we go back to       and I want to look at Japan. And I want to look at Sweden and the United States. And I'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here and the red Toyota down there  and the brownish Volvo. And here we go. Here we go. The Toyota has a very bad start down here  you can see  and the United States Ford is going off road there. And the Volvo is doing quite fine. This is the war. The Toyota got off track  and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden    can you see that  And they are taking over Sweden  and they are now healthier than Sweden. That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota. And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan. They really caught up. And this changes gradually. We have to look over generations to understand it. And let me show you my own sort of family history    we made these graphs here. And this is the same thing  money down there  and health  you know  And this is my family. This is Sweden        when my great great grandma was born. Sweden was like Sierra Leone today. And this is when great grandma was born      . And Sweden was like Mozambique. And this is when my grandma was born      . She took care of me as a child  so I'm not talking about statistic now    now it's oral history in my family. That's when I believe statistics  when it's grandma verified statistics. I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics. Sweden was like Ghana. It's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub Saharan Africa. I told you last year  I'll tell you again  my mother was born in Egypt  and I    who am I  I'm the Mexican in the family. And my daughter  she was born in Chile  and the grand daughter was born in Singapore  now the healthiest country on this Earth. It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago  with better child survival. But they're very small  you know  They're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests. But homage to Singapore. Singapore is the best one. Now this looks also like a very good story. But it's not really that easy  that it's all a good story. Because I have to show you one of the other facilities. We can also make the color here represent the variable    and what am I choosing here  Carbon dioxide emission  metric ton per capita. This is       and United States was emitting    tons per person. And China was emitting  .   and India was emitting  .   tons per capita. And what happens when we moved on  Well  you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier    everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide. There is no one who has done it so far. And we don't have all the updated data any longer  because this is really hot data today. And there we are      . And in the discussion I attended with global leaders  you know  many say now the problem is that the emerging economies  they are getting out too much carbon dioxide. The Minister of the Environment of India said   Well  you were the one who caused the problem.  The OECD countries    the high income countries    they were the ones who caused the climate change.  But we forgive you  because you didn't know it. But from now on  we count per capita. From now on we count per capita. And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission.  This really shows you  we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate. And this is really what has to be changed. I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world  but I don't think it's like this. The world is quite a messy place. This we can call Dollar Street. Everyone lives on this street here. What they earn here    what number they live on    is how much they earn per day. This family earns about one dollar per day. We drive up the street here  we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day. And we drive away here    we find the first garden in the street  and they earn    to    dollars a day. And how do they live  If we look at the bed here  we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor. This is what poverty line is       percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs  the food for the day. This is two to five dollars. You have a bed. And here it's a much nicer bedroom  you can see. I lectured on this for Ikea  and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here. And this is the sofa  how it will emerge from there. And the interesting thing  when you go around here in the photo panorama  you see the family still sitting on the floor there. Although there is a sofa  if you watch in the kitchen  you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to    dollars. It comes beyond here  when you really can get good working conditions in the family. And if you really want to see the difference  you look at the toilet over here. This can change. This can change. These are all pictures and images from Africa  and it can become much better. We can get out of poverty. My own research has not been in IT or anything like this. I spent    years in interviews with African farmers who were on the verge of famine. And this is the result of the farmers needs research. The nice thing here is that you can't see who are the researchers in this picture. That's when research functions in poor societies    you must really live with the people. When you're in poverty  everything is about survival. It's about having food. And these two young farmers  they are girls now    because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS    they discuss with a trained agronomist. This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi  Junatambe Kumbira  and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant    the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found. And they are very  very eagerly interested to get advice  and that's to survive in poverty. That's one context. Getting out of poverty. The women told us one thing.  Get us technology. We hate this mortar  to stand hours and hours. Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour  then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves.  Technology will bring you out of poverty  but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty. And this woman is very happy now  bringing her products to the market. But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count  and won't be cheated when she reaches the market. She wants her kid to be healthy  so she can go to the market and doesn't have to stay home. And she wants the infrastructure    it is nice with a paved road. It's also good with credit. Micro credits gave her the bicycle  you know. And information will tell her when to go to market with which product. You can do this. I find my experience from    years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible. Africa has not done bad. In    years they've gone from a pre Medieval situation to a very decent     year ago Europe  with a functioning nation and state. I would say that sub Saharan Africa has done best in the world during the last    years. Because we don't consider where they came from. It's this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us  Argentina and Mozambique together    years ago  and says that Mozambique did worse. We have to know a little more about the world. I have a neighbor who knows     types of wine. He knows everything. He knows the name of the grape  the temperature and everything. I only know two types of wine    red and white. But my neighbor only knows two types of countries    industrialized and developing. And I know      I know about the small data. But you can do that. But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious  You make a PowerPoint  you know  Homage to the Office package  no  What is this  what is this  what am I telling  I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development. Everyone wants your pet thing. If you are in the corporate sector  you love micro credit. If you are fighting in a non governmental organization  you love equity between gender. Or if you are a teacher  you'll love UNESCO  and so on. On the global level  we have to have more than our own thing. We need everything. All these things are important for development  especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare. Now  what we need to think about is  what is a goal for development  and what are the means for development  Let me first grade what are the most important means. Economic growth to me  as a public health professor  is the most important thing for development because it explains    percent of survival. Governance. To have a government which functions    that's what brought California out of the misery of     . It was the government that made law function finally. Education  human resources are important. Health is also important  but not that much as a mean. Environment is important. Human rights is also important  but it just gets one cross. Now what about goals  Where are we going toward  We are not interested in money. Money is not a goal. It's the best mean  but I give it zero as a goal. Governance  well it's fun to vote in a little thing  but it's not a goal. And going to school  that's not a goal  it's a mean. Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy    at my age especially    you can stand here  you're healthy. And that's good  it gets two plusses. Environment is very  very crucial. There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up. But where are the important goals  Of course  it's human rights. Human rights is the goal  but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development. And culture. Culture is the most important thing  I would say  because that's what brings joy to life. That's the value of living. So the seemingly impossible is possible. Even African countries can achieve this. And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible. And remember  please remember my main message  which is this  the seemingly impossible is possible. We can have a good world. I showed you the shots  I proved it in the PowerPoint  and I think I will convince you also by culture. Bring me my sword  Sword swallowing is from ancient India. It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious. And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel    solid steel    this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army        in the last year we had war. And it's all solid steel    you can hear here. And I'm going to take this blade of steel  and push it down through my body of blood and flesh  and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible. Can I request a moment of absolute silence  First place I'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss. And I say believe because this process is still ongoing. Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I'll talk a little bit about. One of the things that's changed here  in the last     years since Jules Verne had great science fiction concepts of what the underworld was like  is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about. We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity. Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight. When you go on a thing like this  we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months  with a team as small as    or     to as big as    . And a lot of people ask me  you know  what kind of people do you get for a project like this  While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA  it's nonetheless thorough. We're looking for competence  discipline  endurance  and strength. In case you're wondering  this is our strength test. But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations. We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance. From the entrance  this is nothing like a commercial cave. You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J   not K   but J . We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point. And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse  except that you're now running a string of these things down. The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you're down there  otherwise in damp  moist  cold conditions in utterly dark places. I should mention that everything you're seeing here  by the way  is artificially illuminated at great effort. Otherwise it is completely dark in these places. The deeper you go  the more you run into a conflict with water. It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down. And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice. So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late     s. So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico. Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous. We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film. Along that same line  I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year  we have never seen monsters underground    at least the kind that eat you. If there is a monster underground  it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance. Next year I'll be leading an international team to J . We're going to be shooting from minus       meters    that's a little over       feet down    at    kilometers from the entrance. The lead crews will be underground for pushing    days straight. I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time. Eventually  if you keep going down in these things  probability says that you're going to run into a place like this. It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof. And when you used to find these things  they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon. Now I remember that term really well for two reasons. Number one  it's the name of my rock band  and second  is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor. And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this. This is some life support equipment closed cycle. And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of     meters straight down underwater. When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA. It's like doing extra vehicular activity in space  but at much greater distances  and at much greater physical peril. So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range  away from a safe haven. Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in     . of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before. This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet. To experience it is a privilege. Bill Stone  That was taken in Wakulla Springs  Florida. Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before     . It was developed within a two year period and used on actual exploratory projects. This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper  and it produced the first three dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave  and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs. It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world. This is Europa. Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day. This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there. For those who have never seen this story  Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago  called  Aliens of the Deep.  There was a brief clip    would be the ultimate robotic challenge. Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light  it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle. It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice. Now we have to get through the ice. You need a melt probe. It's basically a nuclear heated torpedo. The ice could be anywhere from three to    miles deep. Week after week  the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice  until finally    Now  what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean  You need an AUV  an autonomous underwater vehicle. It needs to be one smart puppy  able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean. BS  What Jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV. I mean  I cut through three years of engineering meetings  design and system integration  and introduced DEPTHX    Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer. And as the movie says  this is one smart puppy. It's got    sensors     onboard computers          lines of behavioral autonomy code  packs more than    kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent. This is the target site  the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico. It's been explored to a depth of     meters and beyond that nobody knows anything. This is part of DEPTHX's mission. There are two primary targets we're doing here. One is  how do you do science autonomy underground  How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist  There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about  but basically we drive through the space  we populate it with environmental variables    sulphide  halide  things like that. We calculate gradient surfaces  and drive the bot over to a wall where there's a high probability of life. We move along the wall  in what's called proximity operations  looking for changes in color. If we see something that looks interesting  we pull it into a microscope. If it passes the microscopic test  we go for a collection. We either draw in a liquid sample  or we can actually take a solid core from the wall. No hands at the wheel. This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own. The real hat trick for this vehicle  though  is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed  known as  D SLAM  for simultaneous localization and mapping. DEPTHX is an all seeing eyeball. Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time  allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor lock on what it's gone through already. What I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done. This May  we're going to go from minus       meters in Zacaton  and if we're very lucky  DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically discovered division of bacteria. The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then  if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go  we could potentially launch by       and by      we may have the first evidence of life off this planet. What then of manned space exploration  The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by     . The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots. It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were    years ago. Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime. What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas. And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here. There are three underpinnings of working in space privately. One of them is the requirement for economical earth to space transport. The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them. Go  go  go. The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit. Orbital hotels to start with  but workshops for the rest of us later on. The final missing piece  the real paradigm buster  is this  a gas station on orbit. It's not going to look like that. If it existed  it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning. Now  to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement  I've got to give you the basics of Space    . And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram. Anybody drink one of these here this week  You'd pay        dollars for that in orbit. That's more than you pay for TED  if Google dropped their sponsorship. The second is more than    percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant. Thus  every time you'd want to do anything in space  you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator. Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics. So  what if you could get your gas at a   th the price  There is a place where you can. In fact  you can get it better    you can get it at    times lower if you can find propellant on the moon. There is a little known mission that was launched by the Pentagon     years ago now  called Clementine. And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon. That signal was so strong  it could only have been produced by    trillion tons of water buried in the sediment  collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material. If we're going to get that  and make that gas station possible  we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space. We can't do that right now. The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground  and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces. We have to beat that. We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics. We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything. This is an idea that  again  came out of Livermore back in       with Dr. Lowell Wood's group. And we can extend that now to just about everything. Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit. We can go much further. We can build space tugs  orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water. There's another thing. When you're coming back from the moon  you have to deal with orbital mechanics. It says you're moving        feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station. You got two choices. You can burn rocket fuel to get there  or you can do something really incredible. You can dive into the stratosphere  and precisely dissipate that velocity  and come back out to the space station. It has never been done. It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride    better than Disney. The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency. If you try to do that for the moon  you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there. But if you send a mining team there  without the return propellant  first    Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez  This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty. I like this equipment  you know  and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear. But  if you were truly bold you could get it there  manufacture it  and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done. There's a myth that you can't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and    years. That's not true. In seven years  we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low earth orbit. We're living in one of the most exciting times in history. We're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space. The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration. To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed. We can do it by jump starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater  to mine the moon for resources  and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit. Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing. I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED. I intend to lead that expedition. It can be done in seven years with the right backing. Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who  had they been here today  would have heartily approved. There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier. We have collectively forgotten that lesson. Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.     years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words  I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier  in our time  for all of us. Thank you.
