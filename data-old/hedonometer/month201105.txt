Mark Zuckerberg  a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed. And the journalist was asking him   Why is this so important   And Zuckerberg said   A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.  And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like. So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine  the Internet meant something very different to me. It meant a connection to the world. It meant something that would connect us all together. And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society. But there's this shift in how information is flowing online  and it's invisible. And if we don't pay attention to it  it could be a real problem. So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time    my Facebook page. I'm progressive  politically    big surprise    but I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives. I like hearing what they're thinking about  I like seeing what they link to  I like learning a thing or two. And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed. And what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on  and it was noticing that  actually  I was clicking more on my liberal friends' links than on my conservative friends' links. And without consulting me about it  it had edited them out. They disappeared. So Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible  algorithmic editing of the Web. Google's doing it too. If I search for something  and you search for something  even right now at the very same time  we may get very different search results. Even if you're logged out  one engineer told me  there are    signals that Google looks at    everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located    that it uses to personally tailor your query results. Think about it for a second  there is no standard Google anymore. And you know  the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see. You can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's. But a couple of weeks ago  I asked a bunch of friends to Google  Egypt  and to send me screen shots of what they got. So here's my friend Scott's screen shot. And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot. When you put them side by side  you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are. But when you do read the links  it's really quite remarkable. Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results. Scott's results were full of them. And this was the big story of the day at that time. That's how different these results are becoming. So it's not just Google and Facebook either. This is something that's sweeping the Web. There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization. Yahoo News  the biggest news site on the Internet  is now personalized    different people get different things. Huffington Post  the Washington Post  the New York Times    all flirting with personalization in various ways. And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see  but not necessarily what we need to see. As Eric Schmidt said   It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them.  So I do think this is a problem. And I think  if you take all of these filters together  you take all these algorithms  you get what I call a filter bubble. And your filter bubble is your own personal  unique universe of information that you live in online. And what's in your filter bubble depends on who you are  and it depends on what you do. But the thing is that you don't decide what gets in. And more importantly  you don't actually see what gets edited out. So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix. And they were looking at the Netflix queues  and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed  which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses. They enter the queue  they just zip right out. So  Iron Man  zips right out  and  Waiting for Superman  can wait for a really long time. What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves. You know we all want to be someone who has watched  Rashomon   but right now we want to watch  Ace Ventura  for the fourth time. So the best editing gives us a bit of both. It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan. It gives us some information vegetables  it gives us some information dessert. And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters  these personalized filters  is that  because they're mainly looking at what you click on first  it can throw off that balance. And instead of a balanced information diet  you can end up surrounded by information junk food. What this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong. In a broadcast society    this is how the founding mythology goes    in a broadcast society  there were these gatekeepers  the editors  and they controlled the flows of information. And along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way  and it allowed all of us to connect together  and it was awesome. But that's not actually what's happening right now. What we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones. And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did. So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us  if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see  then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance. We need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important    this is what TED does    other points of view. And the thing is  we've actually been here before as a society. In       it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities. Then people noticed that they were doing something really important. That  in fact  you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information  that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter  and then journalistic ethics developed. It wasn't perfect  but it got us through the last century. And so now  we're kind of back in      on the Web. And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing. I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google    Larry and Sergey    people who have helped build the Web as it is  and I'm grateful for that. But we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life  a sense of civic responsibility. We need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters. And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't. Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being. We need it to connect us all together. We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives. And it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one. Thank you. Phyllis Rodriguez  We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship. And it is. And yet  it feels natural to us now. I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September   th      . We didn't know if he had perished yet until    hours later. At the time  we knew that it was political. We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son    my husband  Orlando  and I and our family. And when I saw it    and yet  through the shock  the terrible shock  and the terrible explosion in our lives  literally  we were not vengeful. And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism  and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him  if convicted  my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that  publicly. Through that and through human rights groups  we were brought together with several other victims' families. When I saw Aicha in the media  coming over when her son was indicted  and I thought   What a brave woman. Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger.  I was still in deep grief  I knew I didn't have the strength. I knew I would find her someday  or we would find each other. Because  when people heard that my son was a victim  I got immediate sympathy. But when people learned what her son was accused of  she didn't get that sympathy. But her suffering is equal to mine. So we met in November       and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui. And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims. So they introduced me to five families. And I saw Phyllis  and I watched her. She was the only mother in the group. The others were brothers  sisters. And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother  just like me. I suffered a lot as a mother. I was married when I was   . I lost a child when I was     a second child when I was   . So the story with Zacarias was too much really. And I still suffer  because my son is like he's buried alive. I know she really cried for her son. But she knows where he is. My son  I don't know where he is. I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured. I don't know what happened to him. So that's why I decided to tell my story  so that my suffering is something positive for other women. For all the women  all the mothers that give life  you can give back  you can change. It's up to us women  because we are women  because we love our children. We must be hand in hand and do something together. It's not against women  it's for us  for us women  for our children. I talk against violence  against terrorism. I go to schools to talk to young  Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young. So if I can save one of the young girls  and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did  well this is something good. This is why I'm here in front of you. PR  I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha  starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members    which was a very private meeting with security  because it was November       and  frankly  we were afraid of the super patriotism of that time in the country    those of us family members. But we were all so nervous.  Why does she want to meet us   And then she was nervous.  Why did we want to meet her   What did we want from each other  Before we knew each others' names  or anything  we had embraced and wept. Then we sat in a circle with support  with help  from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation. And Aicha started  and she said   I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent  but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families. I know what it is to suffer  and I feel that if there is a crime  a person should be tried fairly and punished.  But she reached out to us in that way  and it was  I'd like to say  it was an ice breaker. And what happened then is we all told our stories  and we all connected as human beings. By the end of the afternoon    it was about three hours after lunch    we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. Now what I learned from her  is a woman  not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then  and what was being done to her son  but the life she's had. I never had met someone with such a hard life  from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. And I feel that we have a special connection  which I value very much. And I think it's all about being afraid of the other  but making that step and then realizing   Hey  this wasn't so hard. Who else can I meet that I don't know  or that I'm so different from   So  Aicha  do you have a couple of words for conclusion  Because our time is up. that we have to try to know other people  the other. You have to be generous  and your hearts must be generous  your mind must be generous. You must be tolerant. You have to fight against violence. And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other. This is what I wanted to say. Good afternoon  everybody. I've got something to show you. Think about this as a pixel  a flying pixel. This is what we call  in our lab  sensible design. Let me tell you a bit about it. Now if you take this picture    I'm Italian originally  and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom    but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula   racing over the past couple of decades. Now some time ago  if you wanted to win a Formula   race  you take a budget  and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car. And if the car and the driver were good enough  then you'd win the race. Now today  if you want to win the race  actually you need also something like this    something that monitors the car in real time  has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car  transmitting this information into the system  and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected. This is what  in engineering terms  you would call a real time control system. And basically  it's a system made of two components    a sensing and an actuating component. What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives. Our cities  over the past few years  just have been blanketed with networks  electronics. They're becoming like computers in open air. And  as computers in open air  they're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated. If we fix cities  actually it's a big deal. Just as an aside  I wanted to mention  cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust  but they are    percent of the world's population. They are    percent of the energy consumption    up to    percent of CO  emissions. So if we're able to do something with cities  that's a big deal. Beyond cities  all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects. That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing at MoMA later this year  during the summer. It's called  Talk to Me.  Well our objects  our environment is starting to talk back to us. In a certain sense  it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator. And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there. In a certain sense  it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ... you know  when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses  at the end it said that he took the hammer  threw it at the Moses    actually you can still see a small chip underneath    and said  shouted   Perch  non parli  Why don't you talk   Well today  for the first time  our environment is starting to talk back to us. And I'll show just a few examples    again  with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it. Let's starting with sensing. Well  the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab. It was four and a half years ago in Italy. And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world    that's a cellphone network    and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network  that's collected anyway by the operator  in order to understand how the city works. The summer was a lucky summer        . It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup. Some of you might remember  it was Italy and France playing  and then Zidane at the end  the headbutt. And anyway  Italy won at the end. Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network. Here you see the city. You see the Colosseum in the middle  the river Tiber. It's morning  before the match. You see the timeline on the top. Early afternoon  people here and there  making calls and moving. The match begins    silence. France scores. Italy scores. Halftime  people make a quick call and go to the bathroom. Second half. End of normal time. First overtime  second. Zidane  the headbutt in a moment. Italy wins. Yeah. Well  that night  everybody went to celebrate in the center. You saw the big peak. The following day  again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time. And then everybody moved down. You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo  where  since Roman times  people go to celebrate  to have a big party  and you see the peak at the end of the day. Well  that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago. Another quick example about sensing  it's not about people  but about things we use and consume. Well today  we know everything about where our objects come from. This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer  how they came together. But we know very little about where things go. So in this project  we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system. So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle  just over a year ago  to tag what they were throwing away    different types of things  as you can see here    things they would throw away anyway. Then we put a little chip  little tag  onto the trash and then started following it. Here are the results we just obtained. From Seattle ... after one week. With this information we realized there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system. We can actually do the same thing with much less energy. This data was not available before. But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening. But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away  it doesn't disappear  it's still somewhere on the planet. And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there. And if we show that to people  then we can also promote some behavioral change. So that was the reason for the project. My colleague at MIT  Assaf Biderman  he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing  but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning  and that's actuating our environment. And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza  Spain. It started with a question by the mayor of the city  who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space  in architecture. And the question was  How could technology  new technology  be added to that  And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was  imagine this pipe  and you've got valves  solenoid valves  taps  opening and closing. You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water. If those pixels fall  you can write on it  you can show patterns  images  text. And even you can approach it  and it will open up to let you jump through  as you see in this image. Well  we presented this to Mayor Belloch. He liked it very much. And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo. We called it Digital Water Pavilion. The whole building is made of water. There's no doors or windows  but when you approach it  it will open up to let you in. The roof also is covered with water. And if there's a bit of wind  if you want to minimize splashing  you can actually lower the roof. Or you could close the building  and the whole architecture will disappear  like in this case. You know  these days  you always get images during the winter  when they take the roof down  of people who have been there and said   They demolished the building.  No  they didn't demolish it  just when it goes down  the architecture almost disappears. Here's the building working. You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside. And here was myself trying not to get wet  testing the sensors that open the water. Well  I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working. But actually that night  it was even more fun. All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building  because the way of engaging with the building became something different. Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in  but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water  and you had to jump without getting wet. And that was  for us  was very interesting  because  as architects  as engineers  as designers  we always think about how people will use the things we design. But then reality's always unpredictable. And that's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people. Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels  the pixels made of water  and then projections on them. And this is what led us to think about the following project I'll show you now. That's  imagine those pixels could actually start flying. Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air  and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights    almost as a cloud that can move in space. Here is the video. So imagine one helicopter  like the one we saw before  moving with others  in synchrony. So you can have this cloud. You can have a kind of flexible screen or display  like this    a regular configuration in two dimensions. Or in regular  but in three dimensions  where the thing that changes is the light  not the pixels' position. You can play with a different type. Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes  different types of resolution. But then the whole thing can be just a  D cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many  many directions. Here is the real Flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before. When you turn on the light  actually you see this. So the same as we saw before. And imagine each of them then controlled by people. You can have each pixel having an input that comes from people  from people's movement  or so and so. I want to show you something here for the first time. We've been working with Roberto Bolle  one of today's top ballet dancers    the  toile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan    and actually captured his movement in  D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire. And here you can see Roberto dancing. You see on the left the pixels  the different resolutions being captured. It's both  D scanning in real time and motion capture. So you can reconstruct a whole movement. You can go all the way through. But then  once we have the pixels  then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation. So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for Flyfire. I wanted to show you the last project we are working on. It's something we're working on for the London Olympics. It's called The Cloud. And the idea here is  imagine  again  we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment    almost to impart what we call cloud raising    like barn raising  but with a cloud. Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel. And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that  over the past couple of decades  we went from the physical world to the digital one. This has been digitizing everything  knowledge  and making that accessible through the Internet. Now today  for the first time    and the Obama campaign showed us this    we can go from the digital world  from the self organizing power of networks  to the physical one. This can be  in our case  we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol. That means something built in a city. But tomorrow it can be  in order to tackle today's pressing challenges    think about climate change or CO  emissions    how we can go from the digital world to the physical one. So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together  collectively. The cloud is a cloud  again  made of pixels  in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles. And those particles are water  where our cloud is a cloud of pixels. It's a physical structure in London  but covered with pixels. You can move inside  have different types of experiences. You can actually see from underneath  sharing the main moments for the Olympics in      and beyond  and really using it as a way to connect with the community. So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top  of   like London's new mountaintop. You can enter inside it. And a kind of new digital beacon for the night    but most importantly  a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top. Thank you. So as a fashion designer  I've always tended to think of materials something like this  or this  or maybe this. But then I met a biologist  and now I think of materials like this    green tea  sugar  a few microbes and a little time. I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe  which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria  yeasts and other micro organisms  which spin cellulose in a fermentation process. Over time  these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface. So we start by brewing the tea. I brew up to about    liters of tea at a time  and then while it's still hot  add a couple of kilos of sugar. We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath. We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below    degrees C. And then we're ready to add the living organism. And along with that  some acetic acid. And once you get this process going  you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid. We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth. And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it. And actually  in hot weather  I can just grow it outside. So this is my mini fabric farm. After about three days  the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid. So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing. And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid. So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose. And they're sticking together  forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface. After about two to three weeks  we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness. So the bath on the left is after five days  and on the right  after   . And this is a static culture. You don't have to do anything to it  you just literally watch it grow. It doesn't need light. And when it's ready to harvest  you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold  soapy water. At this point  it's really heavy. It's over    percent water  so we need to let that evaporate. So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet. Again  you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air. And as it's drying  it's compressing  so what you're left with  depending on the recipe  is something that's either like a really light weight  transparent paper  or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather. And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally  or you can use the wet material to form it around a three dimensional shape. And as it evaporates  it will knit itself together  forming seams. So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea. I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin  which intrigues me. Since it's organic  I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals. I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation. Using fruit and vegetable staining  create organic patterning. And using indigo  make it anti microbial. And in fact  cotton would take up to    dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark. And because of the super absorbency of this kind of cellulose  it just takes one  and a really short one at that. What I can't yet do is make it water resistant. So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today  I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water. The dress would get really heavy  and eventually the seams would probably fall apart    leaving me feeling rather naked. Possibly a good performance piece  but definitely not ideal for everyday wear. What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need. So what I want to do is say to a future bug   Spin me a thread. Align it in this direction. Make it hydrophobic. And while you're at it  just form it around this  D shape.  Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing  and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels  possibly even replacement bone tissue. But with synthetic biology  we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality  quantity and shape of material that we desire. Obviously  as a designer  that's really exciting because then I start to think  wow  we could actually imagine growing consumable products. What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency. So we only grow what we need. There's no waste. And in fact  we could make it from a waste stream    so for example  a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant. Finally  at the end of use  we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings. What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton  leather or other textile materials. But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources. Ultimately  maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact. We could  for example  imagine growing a lamp  a chair  a car or maybe even a house. So I guess what my question to you is  in the future  what would you choose to grow  Thank you very much. Bruno Giussani  Suzanne  just a curiosity  what you're wearing is not random.  Suzanne Lee  No.  This is one of the jackets you grew  SL  Yes  it is. It's probably    part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes. It's absorbing my sweat  and it's feeding on it. BG  Okay  so we'll let you go and save it  and rescue it. Suzanne Lee.  SL  Thank you.  The universe is really big. We live in a galaxy  the Milky Way Galaxy. There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky  and you just keep the shutter open  as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope  it will see something like this. Every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way    a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs. There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe.     billion is the only number you need to know. The age of the universe  between now and the Big Bang  is a hundred billion in dog years. Which tells you something about our place in the universe. One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it. It's extremely beautiful. I've often wondered  what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn't have any. But we would also like to understand it. As a cosmologist  I want to ask  why is the universe like this  One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time. If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity  it would be moving away from you. And if you look at a galaxy even farther away  it would be moving away faster. So we say the universe is expanding. What that means  of course  is that  in the past  things were closer together. In the past  the universe was more dense  and it was also hotter. If you squeeze things together  the temperature goes up. That kind of makes sense to us. The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much is that the universe  at early times  near the Big Bang  was also very  very smooth. You might think that that's not a surprise. The air in this room is very smooth. You might say   Well  maybe things just smoothed themselves out.  But the conditions near the Big Bang are very  very different than the conditions of the air in this room. In particular  things were a lot denser. The gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the Big Bang. What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies  a hundred billion stars each. At early times  those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big    literally    at early times. And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections  without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else. Because if there had been  they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole. Keeping the universe very  very smooth at early times is not easy  it's a delicate arrangement. It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly. There is something that made it that way. We would like to know what. So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann  an Austrian physicist in the   th century. And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy. You've heard of entropy. It's the randomness  the disorder  the chaoticness of some systems. Boltzmann gave us a formula    engraved on his tombstone now    that really quantifies what entropy is. And it's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice  so that macroscopically it looks the same. If you have the air in this room  you don't notice each individual atom. A low entropy configuration is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way. A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way. This is a crucially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of thermodynamics    the law that says that entropy increases in the universe  or in some isolated bit of the universe. The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy. That's a wonderful insight  but it leaves something out. This insight that entropy increases  by the way  is what's behind what we call the arrow of time  the difference between the past and the future. Every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing    the fact that you can remember the past  but not the future. The fact that you are born  and then you live  and then you die  always in that order  that's because entropy is increasing. Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy  it's very natural for it to increase because there's more ways to be high entropy. What he didn't explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place. The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very  very smooth. We'd like to understand that. That's our job as cosmologists. Unfortunately  it's actually not a problem that we've been giving enough attention to. It's not one of the first things people would say  if you asked a modern cosmologist   What are the problems we're trying to address   One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman.    years ago  he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures. He gave the popular lectures that became  The Character of Physical Law.  He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads that became  The Feynman Lectures on Physics.  He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became  The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation.  In every one of these books  every one of these sets of lectures  he emphasized this puzzle  Why did the early universe have such a small entropy  So he says    I'm not going to do the accent    he says   For some reason  the universe  at one time  had a very low entropy for its energy content  and since then the entropy has increased. The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding.  So that's our job. We want to know    this is    years ago   Surely   you're thinking   we've figured it out by now.  It's not true that we've figured it out by now. The reason the problem has gotten worse  rather than better  is because in      we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before. We learned that it's accelerating. The universe is not only expanding. If you look at the galaxy  it's moving away. If you come back a billion years later and look at it again  it will be moving away faster. Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating. Unlike the low entropy of the early universe  even though we don't know the answer for this  we at least have a good theory that can explain it  if that theory is right  and that's the theory of dark energy. It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy. In every little cubic centimeter of space  whether or not there's stuff  whether or not there's particles  matter  radiation or whatever  there's still energy  even in the space itself. And this energy  according to Einstein  exerts a push on the universe. It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other. Because dark energy  unlike matter or radiation  does not dilute away as the universe expands. The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same  even as the universe gets bigger and bigger. This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future. For one thing  the universe will expand forever. Back when I was your age  we didn't know what the universe was going to do. Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future. Einstein was fond of this idea. But if there's dark energy  and the dark energy does not go away  the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.    billion years in the past      billion dog years  but an infinite number of years into the future. Meanwhile  for all intents and purposes  space looks finite to us. Space may be finite or infinite  but because the universe is accelerating  there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see. There's a finite region of space that we have access to  surrounded by a horizon. So even though time goes on forever  space is limited to us. Finally  empty space has a temperature. In the     s  Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole  even though you think it's black  it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics. The curvature of space time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation  and the black hole radiates. A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space  then the whole universe radiates. The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations. And so even though the universe will last forever  and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away  there will always be some radiation  some thermal fluctuations  even in empty space. So what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever. Well what is the implication of that  That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the   th century. He said  well  entropy increases because there are many  many more ways for the universe to be high entropy  rather than low entropy. But that's a probabilistic statement. It will probably increase  and the probability is enormously huge. It's not something you have to worry about    the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us. It's very  very unlikely. Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever  that would happen. Everything that is allowed  every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room  would eventually be obtained. So Boltzmann says  look  you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium. He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe. He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton    they were absolute  they just stuck there forever. So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere    the everything molecules. But if you're Boltzmann  you know that if you wait long enough  the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations. And then  of course  in the natural course of things  they will expand back. So it's not that entropy must always increase    you can get fluctuations into lower entropy  more organized situations. Well if that's true  Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern sounding ideas    the multiverse and the anthropic principle. He says  the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can't live there. Remember  life itself depends on the arrow of time. We would not be able to process information  metabolize  walk and talk  if we lived in thermal equilibrium. So if you imagine a very  very big universe  an infinitely big universe  with randomly bumping into each other particles  there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states  and then they relax back. But there will also be large fluctuations. Occasionally  you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies. So Boltzmann says  we will only live in the part of the multiverse  in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles  where life is possible. That's the region where entropy is low. Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time. Now your homework assignment is to really think about this  to contemplate what it means. Carl Sagan once famously said that  in order to make an apple pie  you must first invent the universe.  But he was not right. In Boltzmann's scenario  if you want to make an apple pie  you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie. That will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven  and then making you an apple pie. So this scenario makes predictions. And the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal. Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are  and we have  not only our memories  but our impression that outside there's something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy  it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech  the United States and the galaxy. The good news is that  therefore  this scenario does not work  it is not right. This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation. Even if you left our galaxy out  you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies. And Feynman also understood this. Feynman says   From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation  all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before  we will find it mixed up  and not like the piece we've just looked at    high entropy. If our order were due to a fluctuation  we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it. We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation.  So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer  If the universe is not a fluctuation  why did the early universe have a low entropy  And I would love to tell you the answer  but I'm running out of time. Here is the universe that we tell you about  versus the universe that really exists. I just showed you this picture. The universe is expanding for the last    billion years or so. It's cooling off. But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more. If the dark energy remains around  the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel  they will stop burning. They will fall into black holes. We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes. That universe will last    to the     years    a lot longer than our little universe has lived. The future is much longer than the past. But even black holes don't last forever. They will evaporate  and we will be left with nothing but empty space. That empty space lasts essentially forever. However  you notice  since empty space gives off radiation  there's actually thermal fluctuations  and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space. So even though the universe lasts forever  there's only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe. They all happen over a period of time equal to    to the    to the     years. So here's two questions for you. Number one  If the universe lasts for    to the    to the     years  why are we born in the first    billion years of it  in the warm  comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang  Why aren't we in empty space  You might say   Well there's nothing there to be living   but that's not right. You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness. Why aren't you  More homework assignment for you. So like I said  I don't actually know the answer. I'm going to give you my favorite scenario. Either it's just like that. There is no explanation. This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions. Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe. An egg  an unbroken egg  is a low entropy configuration  and yet  when we open our refrigerator  we do not go   Hah  how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator.  That's because an egg is not a closed system  it comes out of a chicken. Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken. Maybe there is something that naturally  through the growth of the laws of physics  gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations. If that's true  it would happen more than once  we would be part of a much bigger multiverse. That's my favorite scenario. So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation. My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history. And    years from now  all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities. We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse. And even better  we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations. This is a prediction. I might be wrong. But we've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like  why it came to be in the way it did for many  many years. It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday. Thank you. It's great being here at TED. You know  I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head  but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet. The little things in life  sometimes that we forget about  like pollination  that we take for granted. And you can't tell the story about pollinators    bees  bats  hummingbirds  butterflies    without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co evolved over    million years. I've been filming time lapse flowers    hours a day  seven days a week  for over    years. To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of. It fills me with wonder  and it opens my heart. Beauty and seduction  I believe  is nature's tool for survival  because we will protect what we fall in love with. Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth. It reminds us that we are a part of nature  and we're not separate from it. When I heard about the vanishing bees  Colony Collapse Disorder  it motivated me to take action. We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat. And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind. It's like the canary in the coalmine. If they disappear  so do we. It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it. What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers   What motivates the pollinators   Well  their answer was   It's all about risk and reward.  Like a wide eyed kid  I'd say   Why is that   And they'd say   Well  because they want to survive.  I go   Why    Well  in order to reproduce.   Well  why   And I thought that they'd probably say   Well  it's all about sex.  And Chip Taylor  our monarch butterfly expert  he replied   Nothing lasts forever. Everything in the universe wears out.  And that blew my mind. Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward  as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life. Rarely seen by the naked eye  this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment. It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself  over and over again. So here is some nectar from my film. I hope you'll drink  tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden. And always take time to smell the flowers  and let it fill you with beauty  and rediscover that sense of wonder. Here are some images from the film. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. My journey to become a polar specialist  photographing  specializing in the polar regions  began when I was four years old  when my family moved from southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island  up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of     Inuit people  where  we  were one of three non Inuit families. And in this community  we didn't have a television  we didn't have computers  obviously  radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit  playing. The snow and the ice were my sandbox  and the Inuit were my teachers. And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm. And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it. I'd like to share with you  for just two minutes only  some images  a cross section of my work  to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile   Have You Ever.  I don't know why National Geographic has done this  they've never done this before  but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet. National Geographic doesn't do this  so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you. And what these images are    you'll see them at the start of the slide show    there's only about four images    but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest. It's pure white  but it's not a polar bear. It's a spirit bear  or a Kermode bear. There are only     of these bears left. They're more rare than the panda bear. I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one. I thought  my career's over. I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic. What in the heck was I thinking  So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life  after I was a photographer  because they were going to fire me. Because National Geographic is a magazine  they remind us all the time  they publish pictures  not excuses. And after two months of sitting there    one day  thinking that it was all over  this incredible big white male came down  right beside me  three feet away from me  and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it. And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest. He went through this old growth forest and sat up beside this     year old culturally modified tree and went to sleep. And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him  just in the forest  and photograph him. So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross section of my work that I've done on the polar regions. Please enjoy. Brandi Carlile    Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods      And everything there feels just as it should     You're part of the life there     You're part of something good     If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods     Have you ever stared into a starry sky      Lying on your back  you're asking why     What's the purpose      I wonder  who am I      If you've ever stared into a starry sky     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     Aah  ah  aah     Ah  oh  oh  ah  ah  oh  oh     Have you ever stared into a starry sky      Have you ever been out walking in the snow      Tried to get back where you were before     You always end up     Not knowing where to go     If you've ever been out walking in the snow     Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh     Aah  ah  aah  ah  aah     Ah  ah  oh  ah  ah  oh  ah     Oh  ah  ah  ah     Ah  ah  oh  ah  ah  oh  oh     If you'd ever been out walking you would know   Paul Nicklen  Thank you very much. The show's not over. My clock is ticking. OK  let's stop. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level. And in fact  scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years  then they said    years. Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic  the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to    years. And what does that mean  After a while of reading this in the news  it just becomes news. You glaze over with it. And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this. And I want people to understand and get the concept that  if we lose ice  we stand to lose an entire ecosystem. Projections are that we could lose polar bears  they could become extinct in the next    to     years. And there's no better  sexier  more beautiful  charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on. Polar bears are amazing hunters. This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores. There was no ice around. But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it. And this bear swam out to that seal        lb. bearded seal    grabbed it  swam back and ate it. And he was so full  he was so happy and so fat eating this seal  that  as I approached him    about    feet away    to get this picture  his only defense was to keep eating more seal. And as he ate  he was so full    he probably had about     lbs of meat in his belly    and as he ate inside one side of his mouth  he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth. So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive  but it's the ice that's disappearing. We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic. When I worked on polar bears as a biologist    years ago  we never found dead bears. And in the last four or five years  we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place. We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea  floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out. I found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice. These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice. Here's a mother and her two year old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere  and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice  which is great for them  they're safe at this point. They're not going to die of hypothermia. They're going to get to land. But unfortunately     percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem. These ringed seals  these are the  fatsicles  of the Arctic. These little  fat dumplings      pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear. And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here. These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice. They give birth inside the ice  and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice. And here's a picture of sick ice. This is a piece of multi year ice that's    years old. And what scientists didn't predict is that  as this ice melts  these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process. And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea. The visibility's     ft.  we're on our safety lines  the ice is moving all over the place. I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive. But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice  that big chunk of ice up in the corner. In that one single piece of ice  you have     species of microorganisms. And in the spring  when the sun returns to the ice  it forms the phytoplankton  grows under that ice  and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed  and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life. So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden. It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden. Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden. Here's me in my office. I hope you appreciate yours. This is after an hour under the ice. I can't feel my lips  my face is frozen  I can't feel my hands  I can't feel my feet. And I've come up  and all I wanted to do was get out of the water. After an hour in these conditions  it's so extreme that  when I go down  almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head. And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over. I get to hand my camera to my assistant  and I'm looking up at him  and I'm going   Woo. Woo. Woo.  Which means   Take my camera.  And he thinks I'm saying   Take my picture.  So we had this little communication breakdown. But it's worth it. I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales  bowhead whales  and narwhals  and polar bears  and leopard seals today  but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made. I dropped down in this ice hole  just through that hole that you just saw  and I looked up under the underside of the ice  and I was dizzy  I thought I had vertigo. I got very nervous    no rope  no safety line  the whole world is moving around me    and I thought   I'm in trouble.  But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice  giving birth and living out their entire life cycle. This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic  right here. And when you have low  productivity in this  in ice  the productivity in copepods go down. This is a bowhead whale. Supposedly  science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now. This very whale right here could be over     years old. This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution. It could have survived     years of whaling. And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South. Narwhals  these majestic narwhals with their eight foot long ivory tusks  don't have to be here  they could be out on the open water. But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe  catch a breath  because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod. And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods. Alright  my favorite part. When I'm on my deathbed  I'm going to remember one story more than any other. Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful  I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals. Leopard seals  since the time of Shackleton  have had a bad reputation. They've got that wryly smile on their mouth. They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body. They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary. And tragically in         a scientist was taken down and drowned  and she was being consumed by a leopard seal. And people were like   We knew they were vicious. We knew they were.  And so people love to form their opinions. And that's when I got a story idea  I want to go to Antarctica  get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake    find out if they really are these vicious animals  or if they're misunderstood. So this is that story. Oh  and they also happen to eat Happy Feet. As a species  as humans  we like to say penguins are really cute  therefore  leopard seals eat them  so leopard seals are ugly and bad. It doesn't work that way. The penguin doesn't know it's cute  and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous. This is just the food chain unfolding. They're also big. They're not these little harbor seals. They are    ft. long  a thousand pounds. And they're also curiously aggressive. You get    tourists packed into a Zodiac  floating in these icy waters  and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon. The boat starts to sink  they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked. All the leopard seal was doing    it's just biting a balloon. It just sees this big balloon in the ocean    it doesn't have hands    it's going to take a little bite  the boat pops  and off they go. So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage    isn't that beautiful    after five days of crossing the Drake Passage  we have finally arrived at Antarctica. I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide. His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden    Goran. And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one. So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat  and there's this monstrous leopard seal. And even in his voice  he goes   That's a bloody big seal  ya.  And this seal is taking this penguin by the head  and it's flipping it back and forth. And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside out  so it can eat the meat off the bones  and then it goes off and gets another one. And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin  came under the boat  the Zodiac  starting hitting the hull of the boat. And we're trying to not fall in the water. And we sit down  and that's when Goran said to me   This is a good seal  ya. It's time for you to get in the water.  And I looked at Goran  and I said to him   Forget that.  But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter  F.  But he was right. He scolded me out  and said   This is why we're here. And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic. And now you've got to deliver. And you can't publish excuses.  So I had such dry mouth    probably not as bad as now    but I had such  such dry mouth. And my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs. I put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips. I put my snorkel in my mouth  and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water. And this was the first thing she did. She came racing up to me  engulfed my whole camera    and her teeth are up here and down here    but Goran  before I had gotten in the water  had given me amazing advice. He said   If you get scared  you close your eyes  ya  and she'll go away.  So that's all I had to work with at that point. But I just started to shoot these pictures. So she did this threat display for a few minutes  and then the most amazing thing happened    she totally relaxed. She went off  she got a penguin. She stopped about    feet away from me  and she sat there with this penguin  the penguin's flapping  and she let's it go. The penguin swims toward me  takes off. She grabs another one. She does this over and over. And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin. Why else would she release these penguins at me  And after she did this four or five times  she swam by me with this dejected look on her face. You don't want to be too anthropomorphic  but I swear that she looked at me like   This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean.  So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins  she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me  bobbing like this  and she'd let them go. This didn't work. I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding  because I was crying underwater  just because it was so amazing. And so that didn't work. So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this.  Laughter  And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me. This went on for four days. This just didn't happen a couple of times. And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones  so she brought me dead penguins. Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head  and I'm just sitting there shooting away. And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like   Are you for real   Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin. Because in her world  you're either breeding or you're eating    and I'm not breeding  so ... And then that wasn't enough  she started to flip penguins onto my head. She was trying to force feed me. She's pushing me around. She's trying to force feed my camera  which is every photographer's dream. And she would get frustrated  she'd blow bubbles in my face. She would  I think  let me know that I was going to starve. But yet she didn't stop. She would not stop trying to feed me penguins. And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far  I got nervous because she came up to me  she rolled over on her back  and she did this deep  guttural jackhammer sound  this gok gok gok gok. And I thought  she's about to bite. She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me. What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me  and she did that to threat display. She chased that big seal away  went and got its penguin and brought it to me. That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with. I got in the water with    other leopard seals  and I never once had a scary encounter. They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with  and the same with polar bears. And just like the polar bears  these animals depend on an icy environment. I get emotional. Sorry. It's a story that lives deep in my heart  and I'm proud to share this with you. And I'm so passionate about it. Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic  I'll take you  let's go. We've got to get the story out now. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm thrilled to be here. I'm going to talk about a new  old material that still continues to amaze us  and that might impact the way we think about material science  high technology    and maybe  along the way  also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation. So that's kind of a bold statement. I'll tell you a little bit more. This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true. It's sustainable  it's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature    and is biodegradable with a clock  so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years. It's edible  it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response. It actually gets reintegrated in the body. And it's technological  so it can do things like microelectronics  and maybe photonics do. And the material looks something like this. In fact  this material you see is clear and transparent. The components of this material are just water and protein. So this material is silk. So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk. So the question is  how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia  The process of discovery  generally  is inspired by nature. And so we marvel at silk worms    the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber. The silk worm does a remarkable thing  it uses these two ingredients  protein and water  that are in its gland  to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection    so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar. And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about  and that we're familiar with  for the textile industry  the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things. We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar  to this natural Kevlar. So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material. And this is an insight that came  about two decades ago  from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with  David Kaplan. And so we get this starting material. And so this starting material is back to the basic building block. And then we use this to do a variety of things    like  for example  this film. And we take advantage of something that is very simple. The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do. They find their way to self assemble. So the recipe is simple  you take the silk solution  you pour it  and you wait for the protein to self assemble. And then you detach the protein and you get this film  as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates. But I mentioned that the film is also technological. And so what does that mean  It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology  like microelectronics and nanoscale technology. And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface  which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale. So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD. And we can store information that's film with water and protein. So we tried something out  and we wrote a message in a piece of silk  which is right here  and the message is over there. And much like in the DVD  you can read it out optically. And this requires a stable hand  so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people. So let me see. So as you see the film go in transparently through there  and then ... And the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that. So once you have these attributes of this material  then you can do a lot of things. It's actually not limited to films. And so the material can assume a lot of formats. And then you go a little crazy  and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays  like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes. Or you can do beautiful things that  if the camera can capture  you can make. You can add a third dimensionality to the film. And if the angle is right  you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk. But you can do other things. You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light  and so we've made optical fibers. But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics. And you can think of different formats. So for instance  if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle  we do microneedle arrays. What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that's made of silk    just to give you a sense of size. You can do bigger things. You can do gears and nuts and bolts    that you can buy at Whole Foods. And the gears work in water as well. So you think of alternative mechanical parts. And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins  for example  or maybe an entire bone. And so you have here a little example of a small skull    what we call mini Yorick. But you can do things like cups  for example  and so  if you add a little bit of gold  if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods. You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap. Or if you're fashion forward  some silk LED tattoos. So there's versatility  as you see  in the material formats  that you can do with silk. But there are still some unique traits. I mean  why would you want to do all these things for real  I mentioned it briefly at the beginning  the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible. And you see here a picture of a tissue section. And so what does that mean  that it's biodegradable and biocompatible  You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted. Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats  in principle  can be implanted and disappear. And what you see there in that tissue section  in fact  is you see that reflector tape. So  much like you're seen at night by a car  then the idea is that you can see  if you illuminate tissue  you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk. And you see there  it gets reintegrated in tissue. And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing  but reintegration in the environment is important. So you have a clock  you have protein  and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt    unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday. It's edible  so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food. It doesn't taste good  so I'm going to need some help with that. But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle. Silk  during its self assembly process  acts like a cocoon for biological matter. And so if you change the recipe  and you add things when you pour    so you add things to your liquid silk solution    where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines  the self assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants. So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive. So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together    a fractured bone together    and deliver drugs at the same  while your bone is healing  for example. Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge. So we've made a silk card with penicillin in it. And we stored penicillin at    degrees C  so     degrees Fahrenheit  for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin. And so that could be     that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels.  Laughter  And of course  there's no use in storage if you can't use  it . And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have  that they're programmably degradable. And so what you see there is the difference. In the top  you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade  and in the bottom  a film that has been programmed to degrade in water. And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it. So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before. And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you've seen. So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread. We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do  whether you want to replace a vein or a bone  or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics  perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt  maybe carry your drugs in your pocket  deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert  the answer may be in a thread of silk. Thank you. When I was a child  I always wanted to be a superhero. I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy. But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true. So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton  which was a lot of fun  but didn't yield much result. When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers  I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science  to find a more useful truth. I started my journey in California  with a UC Berkeley    year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook  and tried to measure their success and well being throughout their life. By measuring the students' smiles  researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long lasting a subject's marriage would be  how well she would score on standardized tests of well being  and how inspiring she would be to others. In another yearbook  I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture. When I first saw his picture  I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar. But now I know it was all in his smile. Another aha  moment came from a      Wayne State University research project that looked into pre     s baseball cards of Major League players. The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life. Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only   .  years  where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost    years. The good news is that we're actually born smiling. Using  D ultrasound technology  we can now see that developing babies appear to smile  even in the womb. When they're born  babies continue to smile    initially  mostly in their sleep. And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice. Smiling is one of the most basic  biologically uniform expressions of all humans. In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea  Paul Ekman  the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions  found that even members of the Fore tribe  who were completely disconnected from Western culture  and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals  attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would. So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing  we smile often  and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction. How many people here in this room smile more than    times per day  Raise your hand if you do. Oh  wow. Outside of this room  more than a third of us smile more than    times per day  whereas less than    percent of us smile less than five. In fact  those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children  who smile as many as     times per day. Have you ever wondered why being around children  who smile so frequently  makes you smile very often  A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles. You ask why  Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious  and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles. Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real  so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler. In a recent mimicking study at the University of Clermont Ferrand in France  subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles. Without the pencil  subjects were excellent judges  but with the pencil in their mouth    when they could not mimic the smile they saw    their judgment was impaired. In addition to theorizing on evolution in  The Origin of Species   Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory. His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better  rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good. In his study  Darwin actually cited a French neurologist  Guillaume Duchenne  who sent electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles. Please  don't try this at home. In a related German study  researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles. The finding supported Darwin's theory  by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain  in a way that helps us feel better when we smile. Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate    a well regarded pleasure inducer    cannot match. British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to       bars of chocolate. Wait    The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to        pounds sterling in cash. That's like    grand a smile. It's not bad. And think about it this way         times        quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day. And unlike lots of chocolate  lots of smiling can actually make you healthier. Smiling can help reduce the level of stress enhancing hormones like cortisol  adrenaline and dopamine  increase the level of mood enhancing hormones like endorphins  and reduce overall blood pressure. And if that's not enough  smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others. A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile  you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous  but you actually appear to be more competent. So whenever you want to look great and competent  reduce your stress or improve your marriage  or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost  or as if you found    grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages  or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer  healthier  happier life  smile. My name is Amit. And    months ago  I had another job at Google  and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who's actually here  and she allowed me to do it. And it took    months. A lot of fun  negotiations and stories  I can tell you  with    very interesting museums from nine countries. But I'm going to focus on the demo. There are a lot of stories about why we did this. I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide  and it's access. And I grew up in India. I had a great education    I'm not complaining    but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks. And so when I started traveling and going to these museums  I started learning a lot. And while working at Google  I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together. So we formed a team  a great team of people  and we started doing this. I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch. So  simple  you come to GoogleArtProject.com. You look around at all these museums here. You've got the Uffizi  you've got the MoMA  the Hermitage  the Rijks  the Van Gogh. I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites  the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Two ways of going in    very simple. Click and  bang  you're in this museum. It doesn't matter where you are    Bombay  Mexico  it doesn't really matter. You move around  you have fun. You want to navigate around the museum  Open the plan up  and  in one click  jump. You're in there  you want to go to the end of the corridor. Keep going. Have fun. Explore. Thanks. I haven't come to the best part. So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings   The Harvesters  by Pieter Bruegel at the Met. I see this plus sign. If the museum has given us the image  you click on it. Now this is one of the images. So this is all of the meta data information. For those of you who are truly interested in art  you can click this    but I'm going to click this off right now. And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology. So this image  for example  has close to  I think  around    billion pixels. And I get a lot of people asking me   What do you get for    billion pixels   So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for    billion pixels. You can zoom around very simply. You see some fun stuff happening here. I love this guy  his expression is priceless. But then you really want to go deep. And so I started playing around  and I found something going on over here. And I was like   Hold on. That sounds interesting.  Went in  and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something. I did a little research  spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met  and actually found out that this is a game called squall  which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday. And apparently it was quite popular. I don't know why they did it  but I learned something about it. Now just to get really deep in  you can really get to the cracks. Now just to give you some perspective  I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get. Here is where we were  and this is the painting. The best is yet to come    so in a second. So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA  again in New York. So another one of my favorites   The Starry Night.  Now the example I showed you was all about finding details. But what if you want to see brush strokes  And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece  You zoom in. You really go in. I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting  and I'm really going to get to the cracks. This is  The Starry Night   I think  never seen like this before. I'm going to show you my other favorite feature. There's a lot of other stuff here  but I don't have time. This is the real cool part. It's called Collections. Any one of you  anybody    doesn't matter if you're rich  if you're poor  if you have a fancy house    doesn't matter. You can go and create your own museum online    create your own collection across all these images. Very simply  you go in    and I've created this  called The Power of Zoom    you can just zoom around. This is  The Ambassadors   based in the National Gallery. You can annotate the stuff  send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces. So I think  in conclusion  for me  the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google. It doesn't  in my opinion  even come from the museums. I probably shouldn't say that. It really comes from these artists. And that's been my humbling experience in this. I mean  I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online. And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is   Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum   And the answer is no. It's to supplement the experience. And that's it. Thank you. Thank you. I decided when I was asked to do this that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend Richard Feynman. I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence. And I'm going to tell you the Richard Feynman that I knew. I'm sure there are other people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew  and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman. Richard Feynman was a very complex man. He was a man of many  many parts. He was  of course  foremost  a very  very  very great scientist. He was an actor. You saw him act. I also had the good fortune to be in those lectures  up in the balcony. They were fantastic. He was a philosopher  he was a drum player  he was a teacher par excellence. Richard Feynman was also a showman  an enormous showman. He was brash  irreverent    he was full of macho  a kind of macho one upmanship. He loved intellectual battle. He had a gargantuan ego. But the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom. And what I mean by that is a lot of room  in my case    I can't speak for anybody else    but in my case  a lot of room for another big ego. Well  not as big as his  but fairly big. I always felt good with Dick Feynman. It was always fun to be with him. He always made me feel smart. How can somebody like that make you feel smart  Somehow he did. He made me feel smart. He made me feel he was smart. He made me feel we were both smart  and the two of us could solve any problem whatever. And in fact  we did sometimes do physics together. We never published a paper together  but we did have a lot of fun. He loved to win. With these little macho games we would sometimes play    and he didn't only play them with me  he played them with all sorts of people    he would almost always win. But when he didn't win  when he lost  he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won. I remember once he told me a story about a joke that the students played on him. They took him    I think it was for his birthday    they took him for lunch. They took him for lunch to a sandwich place in Pasadena. It may still exist  I don't know. Celebrity sandwiches was their thing. You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich. You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich. The students went there in advance  and they arranged that they would all order Feynman sandwiches. One after another  they came in and ordered Feynman sandwiches. Feynman loved this story. He told me this story  and he was really happy and laughing. When he finished the story  I said to him   Dick  I wonder what would be the difference between a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich.  And without skipping a beat at all  he said   Well  they'd be about the same. The only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham   ham  as in bad actor. Well  I happened to have been very quick that day  and I said   Yeah  but a lot less baloney.  The truth of the matter is that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham  but absolutely no baloney. What Feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense    phoniness  false sophistication  jargon. I remember sometime during the '  s  the mid '  s  Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times up in San Francisco at some very rich guy's house    up in San Francisco for dinner. And the last time the rich guy invited us  he also invited a couple of philosophers. These guys were philosophers of mind. Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness. And they were full of all kinds of jargon. I'm trying to remember the words     monism    dualism   categories all over the place. I didn't know what those things meant  neither did Dick    neither did Sydney for that matter. And what did we talk about  Well  what do you talk about when you talk about minds  One thing  there's one obvious thing to talk about    can a machine become a mind  Can you build a machine that thinks like a human being  that is conscious  We sat around and we talked about this    we of course never resolved it. But the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been science iphizing. It's a scientific question after all. And this was a very  very dangerous thing to do around Dick Feynman. Feynman let them have it    both barrels  right between the eyes. It was brutal  it was funny    ooh  it was funny. But it was really brutal. He really popped their balloon. But the amazing thing was    Feynman had to leave a little early. He wasn't feeling too well  so he left a little bit early. And Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers. And the amazing thing is these guys were flying. They were so happy. They had met the great man  they had been instructed by the great man  they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud  and it was something special. I realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman  even when he did what he did. Dick  he was my friend. I did call him Dick. Dick and I had a certain  a little bit of a rapport. I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had. We liked each other  we liked the same kind of things. I also liked the kind of intellectual macho games. Sometimes I would win  mostly he would win  but we both enjoyed them. And Dick became convinced at some point that he and I had some kind of similarity of personality. I don't think he was right. I think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves. But he was convinced of this. And he was curious. The man was incredibly curious. And he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection. And one day we were walking. We were in France. We were in Les Houches. We were up in the mountains      . We were up in the mountains  and Feynman said to me  he said   Leonardo.  The reason he called me Leonardo is because we were in Europe and he was practicing his French. And he said   Leonardo  were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid   And I said   Well  my real hero was my father. He was a working man  had a fifth grade education. He was a master mechanic  and he taught me how to use tools. He taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things. He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem. He didn't call it the hypotenuse  he called it the shortcut distance.  And Feynman's eyes just opened up. He went off like a light bulb. And he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father. In fact  he had been convinced at one time that  to be a good physicist  that it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father. I apologize for the sexist conversation here  but this is the way it really happened. He said that he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary    the necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist. Being Dick  he  of course  wanted to check this. He wanted to go out and do an experiment. So  well he did. He went out and did an experiment. He asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists   Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you   And to a man    they were all men    to a man  every single one of them said   My mother.  There went that theory down the trashcan of history. But he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father. And for some time  he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well. I don't know. Maybe. Who knows  But let me tell you a little bit about Feynman the physicist. Feynman's style    no  style is not the right word. Style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing. There's something much deeper than that  but I can't think of another word for it. Feynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest  most elementary solution to a problem that was possible. If it wasn't possible  you had to use something fancier. But no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could. But he also deeply believed  he truly believed  that if you couldn't explain something simply you didn't understand it. In the     s  people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked. There was a theory. It was due to a Russian mathematical physicist  and it was a complicated theory. I'll tell you what that theory was soon enough. It was a terribly complicated theory full of very difficult integrals and formulas and mathematics and so forth. And it sort of worked  but it didn't work very well. The only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very  very far apart. The helium atoms had to be very far apart. And unfortunately  the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other. Feynman decided  as a sort of amateur helium physicist  that he would try to figure it out. He had an idea  a very clear idea. He would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like. He would try to visualize it  guided by a small number of simple principles. The small number of simple principles were very  very simple. The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other  they repel. The implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero  it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other. The other fact is that the ground state  the lowest energy state of a quantum system  the wave function is always very smooth    has the minimum number of wiggles. So he sat down    and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil    and he tried to write down  and did write down  the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between. He wrote down a simple thing. It was so simple  in fact  that I suspect a really smart high school student  who didn't even have calculus  could understand what he wrote down. The thing was that that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium and then some. I've always wondered whether the professionals  the real professional helium physicists  were just a little bit embarrassed by this. They had their super powerful technique  and they couldn't do as well. Incidentally  I'll tell you what that super powerful technique was. It was the technique of Feynman diagrams. He did it again in     . In       in my own university    I wasn't there at the time    but in       they were exploring the structure of the proton. The proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles. This was more or less known. And the way to analyze it was  of course  Feynman diagrams. That's what Feynman diagrams were constructed for    to understand particles. The experiments that were going on were very simple. You simply take the proton  and you hit it really sharply with an electron. This was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for. The only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated. They're difficult integrals. If you could do all of them  you would have a very precise theory. But you couldn't  they were just too complicated. People were trying to do them. You could do a one loop diagram. Don't worry about one loop. One loop  two loops    maybe you could do a three loop diagram  but beyond that  you couldn't do anything. Feynman said   Forget all of that. Just think of the proton as an assemblage of little particles    a swarm of little particles.  He called them partons. He called them partons. He said   Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast.  Because they're moving real fast  relativity says the internal motions go very slow. The electron hits it suddenly. It's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton. What do you see  You see a frozen bunch of partons. They don't move  and because they don't move during the course of the experiment  you don't have to worry about how they're moving. You don't have to worry about the forces between them. You just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons. This was the key to analyzing these experiments. Extremely effective  it really did    somebody said the word revolution is a bad word. I suppose it is  so I won't say revolution    but it certainly evolved very  very deeply our understanding of the proton  and of particles beyond that. Well  I had some more that I was going to tell you about my connection with Feynman  what he was like  but I see I have exactly half a minute. So I think I'll just finish up by saying I actually don't think Feynman would have liked this event. I think he would have said   I don't need this.  But how should we honor Feynman  How should we really honor Feynman  I think the answer is we should honor Feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can. Thank you. Think about your day for a second. You woke up  felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door  encountered new colleagues and had great discussions  and felt in awe when you found something new. But I bet there's something you didn't think about today    something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all. And that's that all the sensations  feelings  decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain. Now the brain may not look like much from the outside    a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh  amorphous    but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain  and to see the intricacy of what lies within. And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons. Now unlike a human designed computer  where there's a fairly small number of different parts    we know how they work  because we humans designed them    the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells  maybe tens of thousands. They come in different shapes  they're made out of different molecules. And they project and connect to different brain regions  and they also change different ways in different disease states. Let's make it concrete. There's a class of cells  a fairly small cell  an inhibitory cell  that quiets its neighbors. It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia. It's called the basket cell. And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about. New ones are being discovered everyday. As just a second example  these pyramidal cells  large cells  they can span a significant fraction of the brain. They're excitatory. And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy. Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device. They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs  which then  if they pass a certain threshold  will go to thousands of downstream partners. And this process  which takes just a millisecond or so  happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your     billion cells  as long as you live and think and feel. So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does  Ideally  we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies. If we could activate cells  we could see what powers they can unleash  what they can initiate and sustain. If we could turn them off  then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for. And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today. And honestly  where we've gone through over the last    years  through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off  both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans. Now before I tell you about the technology  the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room  if we live long enough  will encounter  perhaps  a brain disorder. Already  a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them  and the numbers don't do it justice though. These disorders    schizophrenia  Alzheimer's  depression  addiction    they not only steal our time to live  they change who we are. They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people. Now in the   th century  there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders  and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders  practically none of them can be considered to be cured. And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical. This elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance. That's also why  perhaps  most of the drugs  and not all  on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too. Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain. And for Parkinson's disease  Cochlear implants  these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder. But electricity also will go in all directions    the path of least resistance  which is where that phrase  in part  comes from. And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix. So again  we're sent back to the idea of ultra precise control. Could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go  So when I started in neuroscience    years ago  I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist  and the first thing I thought about was  if these neurons are electrical devices  all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance. If we could turn on the electricity in one cell  but not its neighbors  that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells  figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded. And also it would allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry. Now how are we going to do that  Well there are many molecules that exist in nature  which are able to convert light into electricity. You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells. If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow  then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light. And their neighbors  which don't have the molecule  would not. There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen  and that's the ability to get light into the brain. And to do that    the brain doesn't feel pain    you can put    taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on    optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate  in animal models for example  in pre clinical studies  these neurons and to see what they do. So how do we do this  Around       in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth  this vision came to fruition. There's a certain alga that swims in the wild  and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally. And it senses light with a little eye spot  which works not unlike how our eye works. In its membrane  or its boundary  it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity. So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins. And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about. When blue light hits it  it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye spot  and that allows this eye spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery. So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons. And because it's a protein  it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism. So all we've got to do is take that DNA  put it into a gene therapy vector  like a virus  and put it into neurons. So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy  and lots of viruses were coming along. So this turned out to be very simple to do. And early in the morning one day in the summer of       we gave it a try  and it worked on the first try. You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron. The neuron uses its natural protein making machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell  like putting solar panels on a roof  and the next thing you know  you have a neuron which can be activated with light. So this is very powerful. One of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors. And you can do that  you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others. And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells. This field has now come to be known as optogenetics. And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do  you can take a complex network  use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network. And then when you shine light on the entire network  just that cell type will be activated. So for example  lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier    the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory. If we can deliver that gene to these cells    and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene  of course    and then flash blue light over the entire brain network  just these cells are going to be driven. And when the light turns off  these cells go back to normal  so they don't seem to be averse against that. Not only can you use this to study what these cells do  what their power is in computing in the brain  but you can also use this to try to figure out    well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells  if indeed they're atrophied. Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we're using this  both at the scientific  clinical and pre clinical levels. One of the questions we've confronted is  what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward  Because if you could find those  those would be some of the signals that could drive learning. The brain will do more of whatever got that reward. And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction. So if we could figure out what cells they are  we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against  or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability. So to do that  we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorella group  where one side of this little box  if the animal goes there  the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light. So if these cells can mediate reward  the animal should go there more and more. And so that's what happens. This animal's going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there  and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that. And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times. These are the dopamine neurons  which some of you may have heard about  in some of the pleasure centers in the brain. Now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough  indeed  to drive learning. Now we can generalize the idea. Instead of one point in the brain  we can devise devices that span the brain  that can deliver light into three dimensional patterns    arrays of optical fibers  each coupled to its own independent miniature light source. And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to date in a dish    like high throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen. Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders. And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post traumatic stress disorder    a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear. And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear. This goes back to the Pavlovian days. It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning    where a tone ends with a brief shock. The shock isn't painful  but it's a little annoying. And over time    in this case  a mouse  which is a good animal model  commonly used in such experiments    the animal learns to fear the tone. The animal will react by freezing  sort of like a deer in the headlights. Now the question is  what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear  So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear. But we activate targets in the brain  different ones  using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide  in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear. And so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now. This is an area in the prefrontal cortex  a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states. And the animal's going to hear a tone    and a flash of light occurred there. There's no audio on this  but you can see the animal's freezing. This tone used to mean bad news. And there's a little clock in the lower left hand corner  so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this. And now this next clip is just eight minutes later. And the same tone is going to play  and the light is going to flash again. Okay  there it goes. Right now. And now you can see  just    minutes into the experiment  that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory. Now over the last couple of years  we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off. If we could do that  this could be extremely powerful. If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds  you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded. And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life    every kingdom of life except for animals  we see slightly differently. And we found all sorts of molecules  they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins  that respond to green and yellow light. And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin. Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go. Consider  for example  a condition like epilepsy  where the brain is overactive. Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment  one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain. But that's obviously irreversible  and there could be side effects. What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time  until the seizure dies away  and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state    sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state. So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light  and we beam light in  and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure  we're hoping to be able to turn it off. And so we don't have data to show you on this front  but we're very excited about this. Now I want to close on one story  which we think is another possibility    which is that maybe these molecules  if you can do ultra precise control  can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic  an optical prosthetic. I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon. Seventy five thousand people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted. Maybe         people have Cochlear implants  which allow them to hear. There's another thing  which is you've got to get these genes into cells. And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno associated virus  which probably most of us around this room have  and it doesn't have any symptoms  which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body. And so far  there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus. There's one last elephant in the room  the proteins themselves  which come from algae and bacteria and fungi  and all over the tree of life. Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains  so what is our brain going to do if we put that in  Are the cells going to tolerate it  Will the immune system react  In its early days    these have not been done on humans yet    but we're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this  and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light. So it's early days  to be upfront  but we're excited about it. I wanted to close with one story  which we think could potentially be a clinical application. Now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors  our light sensors that are in the back of our eye  are gone. And the retina  of course  is a complex structure. Now let's zoom in on it here  so we can see it in more detail. The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top  and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom  the ganglion cells  relay the information to the brain  where we see that as perception. In many forms of blindness  like retinitis pigmentosa  or macular degeneration  the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed. Now how could you repair this  It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored  because there's nothing for the drug to bind to. On the other hand  light can still get into the eye. The eye is still transparent and you can get light in. So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras. And because there's so many of these cells in the eye  potentially  they could be very high resolution cameras. So this is some work that we're doing. It's being led by one of our collaborators  Alan Horsager at USC  and being sought to be commercialized by a start up company Eos Neuroscience  which is funded by the NIH. And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze. It's a six arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move  or he'll just sit there. And the goal  of course  of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port. Now mice are smart  so this mouse solves the maze eventually  but he does a brute force search. He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform. So he's not using vision to do it. These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans. And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach. So how are we going to solve this  We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide. We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera    just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive. Light is converted to electricity on them. So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus. And now you can see  the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again. And to point out the power of this  these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives. So this pre clinical study  I think  bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future. To close  I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology. We're developing these tools  but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world  so people can study and try to treat different disorders. And our hope is that  by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them  we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier  practically none of which are cured  and in the   st century make them history. Thank you. Juan Enriquez  So some of the stuff is a little dense. But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs  and being able to target those specifically is a first step. The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors  like an on off switch. Ed Boyden  That's right. JE  Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code. EB  Right  yeah. So with blue light  we can drive information  and it's in the form of a one. And by turning things off  it's more or less a zero. So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities. JE  And in theory  that means that  as a mouse feels  smells  hears  touches  you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros. EB  Sure  yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings  and use that to understand more about the brain. JE  Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them  EB  Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard. We're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too. So we can record information and then drive information back in    sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing. JE  Well  that might change a couple things. Thank you.  EB  Thank you.  Hello  my name is Thomas Heatherwick. I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings. When I was growing up  I was exposed to making and crafts and materials and invention on a small scale. And I was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications I was seeing felt soulless and cold. And there on the smaller scale  the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument  was a materiality and a soulfulness. And this influenced me. The first building I built was    years ago. And since  in the last    years  I've developed a studio in London. Sorry  this was my mother  by the way  in her bead shop in London. I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that. I'm just going to show  for people who don't know my studio's work  a few projects that we've worked on. This is a hospital building. This is a shop for a bag company. This is studios for artists. This is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and         glass beads the size of a golf ball. And this is a window display. And this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St. Paul's Cathedral in London. And this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk. And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain. And just very quickly  something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again. Because the original Routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with  which had this open platform at the back    in fact  I think all our Routemasters are here in California now actually. But they aren't in London. And so you're stuck on a bus. And if the bus is going to stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop  you're just a prisoner. But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform. So we've been working with Transport for London  and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for    years. And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work. The brief is that the bus should use    percent less energy. So it's got hybrid drive. And we've been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics. I was going to show four main projects. And this is a project for a bridge. And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open. And openings seemed    everyone loves opening bridges  but it's quite a basic thing. I think we all kind of stand and watch. But the bridges that we saw that opened and closed    I'm slightly squeamish    but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball. And as he was diving  someone had stamped on his knee  and it had broken like this. And then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken. And so this is in Paddington in London. And it's a very boring bridge  as you can see. It's just steel and timber. But instead of what it is  our focus was on the way it worked. So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other. We actually had to halve its speed  because everyone was too scared when we first did it. So that's it speeded up. A project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station    so a power station that uses organic waste material. In the news  the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time. And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power. But recently  any annual report of a power company doesn't have a power station on it. It has a child running through a field  or something like that. And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station  our condition was that we would work with them and that  whatever we did  we were not just going to decorate a normal power station. And instead  we had to learn    we kind of forced them to teach us. And so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements  and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on. That just taking a field and banging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work. So we looked at how we could compose all those elements    instead of just litter  create one composition. And what we found    this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain. It was voted the worst place in Britain to live. And there are       new homes being built next to this power station. So it felt this has a social dimension. It has a symbolic importance. And we should be proud of where our power is coming from  rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of. So we were looking at how we could make a power station  that  instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside  could be a place that pulls you in. And it has to be    I'm trying to get my        feet high. So it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in  and using the spare soil that's there on the site  we could make a power station that was silent as well. Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference. And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost effective way of making a structure to do this. The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station. It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top. And it's a power park. So people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area  and use that height that we have to have for its function. In Shanghai  we were invited to build    well we weren't invited  what am I talking about. We won the competition  and it was painful to get there. So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion. And an expo is a totally bonkers thing. There's     pavilions. It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened. So there are up to a million people there everyday. And     countries all competing. And the British government saying   You need to be in the top five.  And so that became the governmental goal    is  how do you stand out in this chaos  which is an expo of stimulus  So our sense was we had to do one thing  and only one thing  instead of trying to have everything. And so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain. But the thing that was true  the expo was about the future of cities  and particularly the Victorians pioneered integrating nature into the cities. And the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain. And the world's first major botanical institution is in London  and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting    percent of all the world's plant species. So we suddenly realized that there was this thing. And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful  and I've never met anyone who says   I don't like trees.  And the same with flowers. I've never met anyone who says   I don't like flowers.  But we realized that seeds    there's been this very serious project happening    but that seeds    at these major botanical gardens  seeds aren't on show. But you just have to go to a garden center  and they're in little paper packets. But this phenomenal project's been happening. So we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds  some kind of seed cathedral. But how could we show these teeny weeny things  And the film  Jurassic Park  actually really helped us. Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious  rather than looking like nuts. So the challenge was  how are we going to bring light and expose these things  We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content. So we were trying to think  how could we make a whole thing emanate. By the way  we had half the budget of the other Western nations. So that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch. And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue. Song    We've got the Mop Tops  the Play Doh Mop Tops     Just turn the chair and grow Play Doh hair     They're the Mop Tops   Thomas Heatherwick  Okay  you get the idea. So the idea was to take these        seeds that they agreed to give us  and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box  very simple box element  and make it a building that could move in the wind. So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows. And inside  the daylight    each one is an optic and it brings light into the center. And by night  artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside. And to make the project affordable  we focused our energy. Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch  we focused it on this one element. And the government agreed to do that and not do anything else  and focus our energy on that. And so the rest of the site was a public space. And with a million people there a day  it just felt like offering some public space. We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a mini me version of the seed cathedral  so that  even if you're partially sighted  that it was kind of crunchy and soft  that piece of landscape that you see there. And then  you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur    in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral  in effect  we've shaved it. And inside there's nothing  there's no famous actor's voice  there's no projections  there's no televisions  there's no color changing. There's just silence and a cool temperature. And if a cloud goes past  you can see a cloud on the tips where it's letting the light through. This is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings. A key thing was how people would interact. I mean  in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo. And I just wanted to show you. The British government    any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have. And there was a lot of terror. But there was an underlying support. And so there was a moment when suddenly    actually  the next thing. This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment  who was our client  with the Chinese children  using the landscape. TH  I'm sorry about my stupid voice there. So finally  texture is something. In the projects we've been working on  these slick buildings  where they might be a fancy shape  but the materiality feels the same  is something that we've been trying to research really  and explore alternatives. And the project that we're building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer. And it's in a piece of land that's this site. And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur said that  if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city  they would give them more gross floor area  buildable. So there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city. And the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower  and you squeeze a few trees around the edge  and you see cars parked. It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience  and the rest of it is just for postcards. The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this. So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom  we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer. And by linking these together  we could have    percent of the site as a rainforest  instead of only    percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings. So we're building these buildings. They're actually identical  so it's quite cost effective. They're just chopped at different heights. But the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape  rather than engulf it. And that's my final slide. Thank you. Thank you. June Cohen  So thank you. Thank you  Thomas. You're a delight. Since we have an extra minute here  I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds  which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building. TH  These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure. So there were        of these. This optic was    feet long. And so the daylight was just coming    it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed. Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy. Because it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway  but if you say you're going to drill        holes in it    we had quite a time. There was one person in the contractors who was the right size    and it wasn't a child    who could fit between them for the final waterproofing of the building. JC  Thank you  Thomas. I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist  so I put children to sleep for a living. And I'm an academic  so I put audiences to sleep for free. But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto. And it's from the experience from about    or    years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning  that pain is a disease. Now most of the time  you think of pain as a symptom of a disease  and that's true most of the time. It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation. But about    percent of the time  after the patient has recovered from one of those events  pain persists. It persists for months and oftentimes for years  and when that happens  it is its own disease. And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it  I want to show you how it feels for my patients. So imagine  if you will  that I'm stroking your arm with this feather  as I'm stroking my arm right now. Now  I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this. Please keep your seat. A very different feeling. Now what does it have to do with chronic pain  Imagine  if you will  these two ideas together. Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather  but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling    and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain. In fact  imagine something even worse. Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather  and their brain  was  telling them that they were feeling this hot torch. That was the experience of my patient  Chandler  whom you see in the photograph. As you can see  she's a beautiful  young woman. She was    years old last year when I met her  and she aspired to be a professional dancer. And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals  she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist. Now you would probably imagine  as she did  that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life. Wrap it in an ACE bandage  take some ibuprofen for a week or two  and that's the end of the story. But in Chandler's case  that was the beginning of the story. This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain. You can see that the arm is discolored  purplish in color. It was cadaverically cold to the touch. The muscles were frozen  paralyzed    dystonic is how we refer to that. The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands  to her fingertips  from her wrist up to her elbow  almost all the way to her shoulder. But the worst part was  not the spontaneous pain that was there    hours a day. The worst part was that she had allodynia  the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch. The lightest touch of her arm    the touch of a hand  the touch even of a sleeve  of a garment  as she put it on    caused excruciating  burning pain. How can the nervous system get this so wrong  How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame  Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house. In your house  wires run in the wall  from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb. And when you turn the switch on  the light goes on. And when you turn the switch off  the light goes off. So people imagine the nervous system is just like that. If you hit your thumb with a hammer  these wires in your arm    that  of course  we call nerves    transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires  new nerves  take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt. But the situation  of course  in the human body is far more complicated than that. Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one on one fashion  in fact  what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions    laterally  vertically  up and down in the spinal cord    and they start interacting with other adjacent cells. These cells  called glial cells  were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together  like the nerves. But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation  amplification and  in the case of pain  the distortion of sensory experiences. These glial cells become activated. Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins  which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves  and they start releasing their neurotransmitters  and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells  and so on and so forth  until what we have is a positive feedback loop. It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch  the toilet flushed three doors down  or your dishwasher went on  or your computer monitor turned off. That's crazy  but that's  in fact  what happens with chronic pain. And that's why pain becomes its own disease. The nervous system has plasticity. It changes  and it morphs in response to stimuli. Well  what do we do about that  What can we do in a case like Chandler's  We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time. We treat them with symptom modifying drugs    painkillers    which are  frankly  not very effective for this kind of pain. We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet  and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics. And most importantly  what we do is we use a rigorous  and often uncomfortable  process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life. And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency  despair and depression that always accompanies severe  chronic pain. It's successful  as you can see from this video of Chandler  who  two months after we first met her  is now doings a back flip. And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here  and she's doing absolutely fantastic. But the future is actually even brighter. The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs that simply mask the problem  as we have now  but that will be disease modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells  or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate  that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind up  or plasticity  that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain. So I have hope that in the future  the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized  who said   My philosophy  No pain  no pain.  Thank you very much. So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world. And it's not a trip that requires light years of travel  but it's to a place where it's defined by light. So it's a little appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light. I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence. I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs. I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution. But mostly I'm entranced by it. Since my my first dive in a deep diving submersible  when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays  I've been a bioluminescence junky. But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words  and they were totally inadequate to the task. I needed some way to share the experience directly. And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called Deep Rover. This next video clip  you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence. And the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across. a mess screen will come into contact with the soft bodied creatures of the deep sea. With the sub's lights switched off  it is possible to see their bioluminescence    the light produced when they collide with the mesh. This is the first time it has ever been recorded. Edith Widder  So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark adapted human eye. Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible. But just to try to prove that fact to you  I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration. So  if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible  I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it. And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now  either because they're dead    or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like. Oops. Sorry. I spend most of my time working in the dark  I'm used to that. Okay. So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate  a single celled alga. So why would a single celled alga need to be able to produce light  Well  it uses it to defend itself from its predators. The flash is like a scream for help. It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm  and just like the alarm on your car or your house  it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder  thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away. There's a lot of animals that use this trick  for example this black dragonfish. It's got a light organ under its eye. It's got a chin barbel. It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see  but you'll see in here in a minute. So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime  because the top speed of this fish is one knot  which was the top speed of the submersible. But it was worth it  because we caught it in a special capture device  brought it up into the lab on the ship  and then everything on this fish lights up. It's unbelievable. The light organs under the eyes are flashing. That chin barbel is flashing. It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing  fin lights. It's a scream for help  it's meant to attract attention. It's phenomenal. And you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets. There's other ways you can defend yourself with light. For example  this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud. This blinds or distracts the predator. This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this. Now it may look like a tasty morsel  or a pig's head with wings    but if it's attacked  it puts out a barrage of light    in fact  a barrage of photon torpedoes. I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing. It's phenomenal. So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean    most of them that make light. And we have a pretty good idea  for most of them  why. They use it for finding food  for attracting mates  for defending against predators. But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean  that's where things get really strange. And some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in  Avatar   but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them. They're things like this. This is a golden coral  a bush. It grows very slowly. In fact  it's thought that some of these are as much as       years old  which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed. The other reason is this amazing bush glows. So if you brush up against it  any place you brushed against it  you get this twinkling blue green light that's just breathtaking. And you see things like this. This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book    just all manner of creatures all over this thing. And these are flytrap anemones. Now if you poke it  it pulls in its tentacles. But if you keep poking it  it starts to produce light. And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy. It produces these strings of light  presumably as some form of defense. There are starfish that can make light. And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms. This looks like a plant  but it's actually an animal. And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock. So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents  as you see here. But if we collect it very gently  and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock  it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume  changing color as it goes  from green to blue. Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure. But we have no idea why it does that. Here's another one. This is also a sea pen. It's got a brittle star hitching a ride. It's a green saber of light. And like the one you just saw  it can produce these as bands of light. So if I squeeze the base  the bands go from base to tip. If I squeeze the tip  they go from tip to base. So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle  I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about. So there's a language of light in the deep ocean  and we're just beginning to understand it  and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays. This is an optical lure that I've used. We call it the electronic jellyfish. It's just    blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays. And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye in the Sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals  so it's unobtrusive. So I just want to show you some of the responses we've elicited from animals in the deep sea. So the camera's black and white. It's not high resolution. And what you're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of    like the cockroaches of the ocean    there are isopods all over it. And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish. And when it starts flashing  it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast. But as soon as it starts to flash    and it's going to look big  because it blooms on the camera    I want you to look right here. There's something small there that responds. We're talking to something. It looks like a little of string pearls basically    in fact  three strings of pearls. And this was very consistent. This was in the Bahamas at about       feet. We basically have a chat room going on here  because once it gets started  everybody's talking. And I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water. But the cool thing is  we're talking to it. We don't know what we're saying. Personally  I think it's something sexy. And then finally  I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep sea webcam  which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year. We've only just begun to analyze all of this data. This is going to be a glowing source first  which is like bioluminescent bacteria. And it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean. So this scavenger comes in  which is a giant sixgill shark. And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in  because there's bait right there. But if it had been following the odor plume  it would have come in from the other direction. And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish. That's a    foot long giant sixgill shark. Okay  so this next one is from the webcam  and it's going to be this pinwheel display. And this is a burglar alarm. And that was a Humboldt squid  a juvenile Humboldt squid  about three feet long. This is at       feet in Monterey Canyon. But if it's a burglar alarm  you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly. It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish. But we did see a bunch of responses like this. This guy is a little more contemplative.  Hey  wait a minute. There's supposed to be something else there.  He's thinking about it. But he's persistent. He keeps coming back. And then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more  and thinks   Maybe if I come in from a different angle.  Nope. So we are starting to get a handle on this  but only just the beginnings. We need more eyes on the process. So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible  by all means  climb in and take the plunge. This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list  because we live on an ocean planet. More than    percent     percent  of the living space on our planet is ocean. It's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures  alien life forms that you don't have to travel to another planet to see. But if you do take the plunge  please remember to turn out the lights. But I warn you  it's addictive. Thank you. I'm used to thinking of the TED audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective  intelligent  intellectual  savvy  worldly and innovative people in the world. And I think that's true. However  I also have reason to believe that many  if not most  of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly. Now I know that seems ludicrous. I know that seems ludicrous. And believe me  I lived the same sad life until about three years ago. And what happened to me was I bought  what was for me  a very expensive pair of shoes. But those shoes came with round nylon laces  and I couldn't keep them tied. So I went back to the store and said to the owner   I love the shoes  but I hate the laces.  He took a look and said   Oh  you're tying them wrong.  Now up until that moment  I would have thought that  by age     one of the life skills that I had really nailed was tying my shoes. But not so    let me demonstrate. This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes. Now as it turns out    thank you. Wait  there's more. As it turns out    there's a strong form and a weak form of this knot  and we were taught the weak form. And here's how to tell. If you pull the strands at the base of the knot  you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe. That's the weak form of the knot. But not to worry. If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow  we get this  the strong form of the knot. And if you pull the cords under the knot  you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe. This is a stronger knot. It will come untied less often. It will let you down less  and not only that  it looks better. We're going to do this one more time. Start as usual    go the other way around the loop. This is a little hard for children  but I think you can handle it. Pull the knot. There it is  the strong form of the shoe knot. Now  in keeping with today's theme  I'd like to point out    something you already know    that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else. Live long and prosper. So I think data can actually make us more human. We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives  and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories. Recently  a wise media theorist Tweeted   The   th century culture was defined by the novel  the   th century culture was defined by the cinema  and the culture of the   st century will be defined by the interface.  And I believe this is going to prove true. Our lives are being driven by data  and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories. So I'm going to show you a few of the projects that I've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems. This is a project called Flight Patterns. What you're looking at is airplane traffic over North America for a    hour period. As you see  everything starts to fade to black  and you see people going to sleep. Followed by that  you see on the West coast planes moving across  the red eye flights to the East coast. And you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast  followed by European flights coming in the upper right hand corner. Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast. You see San Francisco and Los Angeles start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left hand corner. I think it's one thing to say there's         planes being monitored by the federal government at any one time  and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows. This is a time lapse image of that exact same data  but I've color coded it by type  so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us. And I started making these  and I put them into Google Maps and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports and the patterns that are occurring there. So here we can see the white represents low altitudes  and the blue are higher altitudes. And you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta. You can see this is a major shipping airport  and there's all kinds of activity there. You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer. See again  the diversity. And you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have. This is scrolling up the East coast. You can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York with the air traffic controllers having to deal with all those major airports next to each other. So zooming back out real quick  we see  again  the U.S.    you get Florida down in the right hand corner. Moving across to the West coast  you see San Francisco and Los Angeles    big low traffic zones across Nevada and Arizona. And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom. I started taking a look as well at different perimeters  because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data. This is looking at ascending versus descending flights. And you can see  over time  the ways the airports change. You see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen. And you can see  eventually the airport actually flips directions. So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT. This is visualizing international communications. So it's how New York communicates with other international cities. And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition. And it had a live feed with a    hour offset  so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through AT T's data and revealing itself. This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab and CurrentCity.org. And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam. So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city  until we approach New Year's Eve  where everybody says   Happy New Year   So this is an interactive tool that you can move around and see different parts of the city. This is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day. So again  you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city. And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before  which happens right here. And then you can see people celebrating the next day. And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases. So now on to something completely different. Some of you may recognize this. This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine. And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well  except for one thing  it's not a robot at all. There's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player. This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon called the Mechanical Turk    named after this guy. And it's based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people  but really difficult for computers. So they made this web service and said   Any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people.  The nerdy side of me thought   Wow  this is amazing. I can tap into thousands of people's minds.  And the other nerdy side of me thought   This is horrible. This is completely bizarre. What does this mean for the future of mankind  where we're all plugged into this borg   I was probably being a little extreme. But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on  and we're just doing these little labors  So I created this drawing tool. I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left. And I said   I'll pay you two cents for your contribution.  And I started collecting sheep. And I collected a lot  a lot of different sheep. Lots of sheep. I took the first        sheep that I collected  and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com where you can actually buy collections of    sheep. You can't pick individual sheep  but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity. And juxtaposed against this grid  you see actually  by rolling over each individual one  the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process. I think there's something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil    something we can all relate to  this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing. I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid. Kind of amazing what some people did. So here's a few statistics from the project. Approximate collection rate of    sheep per hour  which would make a working wage of    cents per hour. There were     rejected sheep that didn't meet  sheep like  criteria and were thrown out of the flock. The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to    minutes. That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication. And there were       people that contributed to the project  or were unique IP addresses    so about how many people contributed. But only one of them out of the       said this. Which I was pretty surprised by. I expected people to be wondering   Why did I draw a sheep   And I think it's a pretty valid question. And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep. Sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts  the first to be selectively bred for production traits  the first animal to be cloned. Obviously  we think of sheep as followers. And there's this reference to  Le Petit Prince  where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep. He draws sheep after sheep. The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box. And he says   It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep. It's about your own interpretation and doing something different.  And I like that. So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's  Modern Times.  It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes during the Industrial Revolution. So there were no longer shoe makers  but now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes. And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot. So I thought this was an interesting clip to divide into    pieces and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool. This basically allowed    what you see on the left side is the original frame  and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by    people who have no idea what it is they're doing. And this was the inspiration for a project that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima. We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for  which is making money. So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into        teeny pieces  and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk. We asked people to draw what it was that they saw. But here there was no sheep like criteria. People  if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face  it actually made it into the bill. So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do. So we took these hundred dollar bills  and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com  where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions. And you can also trade real hundred dollar bills for fake hundred dollar bills and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project  which is now known as One Laptop Per Child. This is again showing all the different contributions. You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings  like this one on top    spent a long time making realistic versions. And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces. Here on the right hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing     .      Really   That's all I'm getting paid for this  So the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about is called Bicycle Built for     . This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey. You may recognize these two guys. This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '  s  where they created the song  Daisy Bell   which was the world's first singing computer. You may recognize it from        A Space Odyssey.  When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song  as a reference to when computers became human. So we resynthesized this song. This is what that sounded like. We broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing. Daisy Bell    Daisy  Daisy ...   Aaron Koblin  And we took all of those individual pieces  and we fed them into another Turk request. This is what it would look like if you went to the site. You type in your code  but you first test your mic. You'd be fed a simple audio clip. And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice. After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted  you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context. And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions. Recording    Daisy  Daisy     give me your answer do     I'm half crazy     all for the love of you     It can't be a stylish marriage     I can't afford a carriage     But you'll look sweet upon the seat     of a bicycle built for two   AK  So James Surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds  that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual. We wanted to see how this applies to collaborative  distributed music making  where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on. So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together. I'm sorry for this. Chorus    Daisy  Daisy     Give me your answer do     I'm half crazy     all for the love of you     It can't be a stylish marriage     I can't afford a carriage     But you'd look sweet upon the seat     of a bicycle built for two   AK  So stepping back for a quick second  when I was at UCLA going to grad school  I was also working at a place called the Center for Embedded Network Sensing. And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners. So basically motion through  D space. And this was seen by a director in L.A. named James Frost who said   Wait a minute. You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video   So we did exactly that. We made a music video for one of my favorite bands  Radiohead. And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers  but we also open sourced it  and we made it released as a Google Code project  where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it. And people were making some amazing things. This is actually two of my favorites  the pin board Thom Yorke and a LEGO Thom Yorke. A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content. More recently  somebody even  D printed Thom Yorke's head  which is a little creepy  but pretty cool. So with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on  I was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something. And I met a music video director named Chris Milk. And we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project. But we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for. So we put the idea on the back burner for a few months. And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin  who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album called  Ain't No Grave.  The lyrics to the leading track are  Ain't no grave can hold my body down.  So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for Johnny Cash. So I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello  also known as Mr. doob  who's a much better programmer than I am  and he made this amazing Flash drawing tool. As you know  an animation is a series of images. So what we did was cross cut a bunch of archival footage of Johnny Cash  and at eight frames a second  we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video. So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you  but I want to show you two short clips. One is the beginning of the music video. And that's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly.   can hold my body down     There ain't no grave     can hold body down     When I hear the trumpet sound     I'm going to ride right out of the ground     Ain't no grave     can hold my body ...   AK  What better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs. Collaborator  I felt really sad when he died. And I just thought it'd be wonderful  it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory. Collaborator Two  It really allows this last recording of his to be a living  breathing memorial. Collaborator Three  For all of the frames to be drawn by fans  each individual frame  it's got a very powerful feeling to it. Collaborator Four  I've seen everybody from Japan  Venezuela  to the States  to Knoxville  Tennessee. Collaborator Five  As much as is different from frame to frame  it really is personal. Collaborator Six  Watching the video in my room  I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it. And I just worked and worked through problems  until my little wee battles that I was fighting within the picture all began to resolve themselves. You can actually see the point when I know what I'm doing  and a lot of light and dark comes into it. And in a weird way  that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well. It's the sum total of his life  all the things that had happened    the bad things  the good things. You're hearing a person's life. AK  So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com  what you'll see is the video playing above. And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project. So this isn't finished at all  but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate. If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails  you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located. And if you find one that you're interested in  you can actually click on it and open up an information panel where you're able to rate that frame  which helps it bubble up to the top. And you can also see the way that it was drawn. Again  you can get the playback and personal contribution. In addition to that  it's listed  the artist's name  the location  how long they spent drawing it. And you can pick a style. So this one was tagged  Abstract.  But there's a bunch of different styles. And you can sort the video a number of different ways. You can say   I want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version. And then this is  again  the abstract version  which ends up getting a little bit crazy. So the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk. And this is called  The Wilderness Downtown.  It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire. Chris and I were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers  where you have HTML  audio and video and the power of JavaScript to render amazingly fast. And we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the Web beyond the four by three or sixteen by nine window and try to make it play out and choreograph throughout the screen. But most importantly  I think  we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project  where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone. What if we had a very low commitment  but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed  So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up. And you type in the address    it actually creates a music video specifically for you  pulling in Google maps and Streetview images into the experience itself. So this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address  but I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect.   Now our lives are changing fast     Hope that something pure can last     Hope that something pure can last     Ooh we used to wait     Ooh we used to wait     Ooh we used to wait     Sometimes it never came     Sometimes it never came     Still moving through the pain     We used to wait for it     We used to wait for it     We used to wait for it   AK  So I think  if there's one thing to take away from my talk today  it's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device. And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data  we have an opportunity  and maybe even an obligation  to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together. Thanks a lot. I want to share with you over the next    minutes a pretty incredible idea. Actually  it's a really big idea. But to get us started  I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world. Now I bet  in this audience  you're thinking of some really incredible technology  some stuff that I haven't even heard of  I'm absolutely sure. But I'm also sure  pretty sure  that absolutely nobody is thinking of this. This is a polio vaccine. And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted. This is a great technology. We can take it completely for granted. But it wasn't always that way. Even here in California  if we were to go back just a few years  it was a very different story. People were terrified of this disease. They were terrified of polio  and it would cause public panic. And it was because of scenes like this. In this scene  people are living in an iron lung. These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before  and then two days later  they can no longer breathe  and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs  but also their breathing muscles. And they were going to spend the rest of their lives  usually  in this iron lung to breathe for them. This disease was terrifying. There was no cure  and there was no vaccine. The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it. Twenty years later  they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine. It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late     s. Finally  a vaccine that could stop this awful disease  and here in the United States it had an incredible impact. As you can see  the virus stopped  and it stopped very  very fast. But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world. And it happened so fast in the United States  however  that even just last month Jon Stewart said this  Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated. Bruce Aylward  Oops. Jon  polio's almost been eradicated. But the reality is that polio still exists today. We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists. This is the picture. There's not very much left in the world. But the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes  almost unknown  I'm sure to most of you here today. It's been working for    years to try and eradicate this disease  and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic. But just last year  we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio. And this is the reason  in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade  on opposite sides of the globe  there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks. Hundreds of people were paralyzed. Hundreds of people died    children as well as adults. And in both cases  we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses  and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries. They had come from thousands of miles away. And in one case  it originated on another continent. And not only that  but when they came into these countries  then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia  where  for the first time in over a decade last year  children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years. Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you  these are under control now  and it looks like they'll probably stop very  very quickly. But the message was very clear. Polio is still a devastating  explosive disease. It's just happening in another part of the world. And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis. So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership  the Polio Partnership  is trying to do. We're not trying to control polio. We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases  because this disease is like a root fire  it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely. So what we're looking for is a permanent solution. We want a world in which every child  just like you guys  can take for granted a polio free world. So we're looking for a permanent solution  and this is where we get lucky. This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary. This virus can only survive in people. It can't live for a very long time in people. It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all. And we've got pretty good vaccines  as I've just showed you. So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely. What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth. Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this  to eradicating diseases. It's been tried six times in the last century  and it's been successful exactly once. And this is because disease eradication  it's still the venture capital of public health. The risks are massive  but the pay off    economic  humanitarian  motivational    it's absolutely huge. One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every    days    in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs. And if we can finish polio eradication  the poorest countries in the world are going to save over    billion dollars in the next    years alone. So those are the kind of stakes that we're after. But smallpox eradication was hard  it was very  very hard. And polio eradication  in many ways  is even tougher  and there's a few reasons for that. The first is that  when we started trying to eradicate polio about    years ago  more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox. And there were more than    times as many people living in these countries. So it was a massive effort. The second challenge we had was    in contrast to the smallpox vaccine  which was very stable  and a single dose protected you for life    the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile. It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat  and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child    it's not potent  it's not going to protect them. Even then  kids need many doses of the vaccine. But the third challenge we have    and probably even bigger one  the biggest challenge    is that  in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy    every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash. So you could get around the disease  you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off. With polio it's almost completely different. The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease. So you can't see the enemy most of the time  and as a result  we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox. We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history. There's over    million people  probably    million people  largely volunteers  who have been working over the last    years in what has now been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime. These people  these    million people  vaccinate over     million children every single year  multiple times at the peak of our operation. Now giving the polio vaccine is simple. It's just two drops  like that. But reaching     million people is much  much tougher. And these vaccinators  these volunteers  they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest  densest urban slums in the world. They've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote  difficult to reach places in the world. And they also have to dodge bullets  because we have got to operate during shaky cease fires and truces to try and vaccinate children  even in areas affected by conflict. One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago    a place which has eradicated polio  not once  but twice  because they got reinfected. He was sitting outside of the road  watching one of these polio campaigns unfold  and a few months later he wrote   This is foreign aid at its most heroic.  And these heroes  they come from every walk of life  all sorts of backgrounds. But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International. This is a group whose million strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over    years. They're right at the center of the whole thing. Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication    more than    years  much longer than it should have    but once it was built  the results were striking. Within a couple of years  every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses  with the exception of four countries that you see here. And in each of those  it was only part of the country. And then  by       one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide    proof of concept. And then today  there's been a    percent reduction    greater than    percent reduction    in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease. When we started  over    years ago        children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus. Last year  it was      . And at the same time  the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas. It's been working to help control pandemic flu  SARS for example. It's also tried to save children by doing other things    giving vitamin A drops  giving measles shots  giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns. But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us  the international community  to reach every single child  every single community  the most vulnerable people in the world  with the most basic of health services  irrespective of geography  poverty  culture and even conflict. So things were looking very exciting  and then about five years ago  this virus  this ancient virus  started to fight back. The first problem we ran into was that  in these last four countries  the strongholds of this virus  we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out. And then to make the matters even worse  the virus started to spread out of these four places  especially northern India and northern Nigeria  into much of Africa  Asia  and even into Europe  causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades. And then  in one of the most important  tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world  we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have. In conditions like this  the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to. Now at that time  there was a great  as you can imagine  frustration    let's call it frustration    it started to grow very  very quickly. And all of a sudden  some very important voices in the world of public health started to say   Hang on. We should abandon this idea of eradication. Let's settle for control    that's good enough.  Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds  it's a false premise. The brutal truth is  if we don't have the will or the skill  or even the money that we need to reach children  the most vulnerable children in the world  with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine  then pretty soon  more than         children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year. There's absolutely no question. These are children like Umar. Umar is seven years old  and he's from northern Nigeria. He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters. Umar also has polio. Umar was paralyzed for life. His right leg was paralyzed in     . This leg  his right leg  now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl  because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends  keep up with his brothers and sisters  than to get up on his crutches and walk. But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid. As you probably can't see the detail here  but this is his report card  and you'll see  he's got perfect scores. He got     percent in all the important things  like nursery rhymes  for example there. But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days  but it's not true. Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances. The reality of polio today is something very different. Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world. It leaves their children paralyzed  and it drags their families deeper into poverty  because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have  trying in vain to find a cure for their children. We think children deserve better. And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago  when people were saying   We should call it off   the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions  new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again. In northern India  we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this  so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters  so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services. In northern Nigeria  the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders  they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence. And now they've even started using these devices    speaking of cool technology    these little devices  little GIS trackers like this  which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators. And then they can track them  and at the end of the day  they look and see  did these guys get every single street  every single house. This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we've been missing. And in Afghanistan  we're trying new approaches    access negotiators. We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child. But as we tried these extraordinary things  as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics  we went back to the vaccine    it's a    year old vaccine    and we thought  surely we can make a better vaccine  so that when they finally get to these kids  we can have a better bang for our buck. And this started an incredible collaboration with industry  and within six months  we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted  just two years ago  the last two types of polio in the world. Now June the ninth        we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine  and it turned out to be a game changer. The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had  and we immediately started using this. Well  in a couple of months we had to get it out of production. And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world. And we didn't start with the easy places. The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan  because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this. Now here at TED  over the last couple of days  I've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible. So this morning at about seven o'clock  I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again  so that you could see something that's just unfolding today  which proves that the impossible is possible. And only two years ago  people were saying that this is impossible. Now remember  northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio. Over         children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio    Uttar Pradesh and Bihar            children every single month. Sanitation is terrible  and our old vaccine  you remember  worked half as well as it should have. And yet  the impossible is happening. Today marks exactly six months    and for the first time in history  not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. India's not unique. In Umar's home country of Nigeria  a    percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year. And in the last six months  we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history. Ladies and gentlemen  with a combination of smart people  smart technology and smart investments  polio can now be eradicated anywhere. We have major challenges  you can imagine  to finish this job  but as you've also seen  it's doable  it has great secondary benefits  and polio eradication is a great buy. And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus  it's a stark reminder that we are failing  as a society  to reach children with the most basic of services. And for that reason  polio eradication  it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice. The huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children. It's ready to reach them with bed nets  with other things. But capitalizing on their enthusiasm  capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started    years ago. Finishing polio is a smart thing to do  and it's the right thing to do. Now we're in tough times economically. But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio   There's never a wrong time to do the right thing.  Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do. And we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last    years. We have a new vaccine  we have new resolve  and we have new tactics. We have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history. But if we blink now  we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease. Here's a great idea to spread  End polio now. Help us tell the story. Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child  every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever. Thank you. Bill Gates  Well Bruce  where do you think the toughest places are going to be  Where would you say we need to be the smartest  BA  The four places where you saw  that we've never stopped    northern Nigeria  northern India  the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan    they're going to be the toughest. But the interesting thing is  of those three  India's looking real good  as you just saw in the data. And Afghanistan  Afghanistan  we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly. It keeps getting reinfected. So the tough ones  going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished. They're going to be the tough ones. BG  Now what about the money  Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year. And is it easy to raise that money  And what's it going to be like the next couple of years  BA  It's interesting. We spend right now about     million to     million dollars a year. That's what it costs to reach     million children. It sounds like a lot of money  it is a lot of money. But when you're reaching     million children multiple times           cents to reach a child    that's not very much money. But right now we don't have enough of that. We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners  and every time we cut corners  more places get infected that shouldn't have  and it just slows us down. And that great buy costs us a little bit more. BG  Well  hopefully we'll get the word out  and the governments will keep their generosity up. So good luck. We're all in this with you. Thank you.  BA  Thank you.  The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist  as an Iranian woman artist  as an Iranian woman artist living in exile. Well  it has its pluses and minuses. On the dark side  politics doesn't seem to escape people like me. Every Iranian artist  in one form or another  is political. Politics have defined our lives. If you're living in Iran  you're facing censorship  harassment  arrest  torture    at times  execution. If you're living outside like me  you're faced with life in exile    the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family. Therefore  we don't find the moral  emotional  psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility. Oddly enough  an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice  the speaker of my people  even if I have  indeed  no access to my own country. Also  people like myself  we're fighting two battles on different grounds. We're being critical of the West  the perception of the West about our identity    about the image that is constructed about us  about our women  about our politics  about our religion. We are there to take pride and insist on respect. And at the same time  we're fighting another battle. That is our regime  our government    our atrocious government   that  has done every crime in order to stay in power. Our artists are at risk. We are in a position of danger. We pose a threat to the order of the government. But ironically  this situation has empowered all of us  because we are considered  as artists  central to the cultural  political  social discourse in Iran. We are there to inspire  to provoke  to mobilize  to bring hope to our people. We are the reporters of our people  and are communicators to the outside world. Art is our weapon. Culture is a form of resistance. I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression. For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics. From the fact that they are only serving one audience  mainly the Western culture. But also  I worry about the West  because often in this country  in this Western world that we have  culture risks being a form of entertainment. Our people depend on our artists  and culture is beyond communication. My journey as an artist started from a very  very personal place. I did not start to make social commentary about my country. The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good    years. It was after the Islamic Revolution of     . While I was absent from Iran  the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture. I came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that I found my place in the society. But instead  I found a country that was totally ideological and that I didn't recognize anymore. More so  I became very interested  as I was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions  I became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution    how  indeed  it had incredibly transformed the lives of Iranian women. I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting  in the way the women of Iran  historically  seemed to embody the political transformation. So in a way  by studying a woman  you can read the structure and the ideology of the country. So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life  and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse    the subject of martyrdom  the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God  faith  but violence and crime and cruelty. For me  this became incredibly important. And yet  I had an unusual position toward this. I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place  but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution. This changed slowly as I found my voice and I discovered things that I didn't know I would discover. So my art became slightly more critical. My knife became a little sharper. And I fell into a life in exile. I am a nomadic artist. I work in Morocco  in Turkey  in Mexico. I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran. Now I am making films. Last year  I finished a film called  Women Without Men.   Women Without Men  returns to history  but another part of our Iranian history. It goes to      when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader  Dr. Mossadegh. The book is written by an Iranian woman  Shahrnush Parsipur. It's a magical realist novel. This book is banned  and she spent five years in prison. My obsession with this book  and the reason I made this into a film  is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female    traditionally  historically in Iran    and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change  freedom and democracy    while the country of Iran  equally  as if another character  also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions. I made this film because I felt it's important for it to speak to the Westerners about our history as a country. That all of you seem to remember Iran after the Islamic Revolution. That Iran was once a secular society  and we had democracy  and this democracy was stolen from us by the American government  by the British government. This film also speaks to the Iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized    in the way we looked  in the way we played music  in the way we had intellectual life. And most of all  in the way that we fought for democracy. These are some of the shots actually from my film. These are some of the images of the coup. And we made this film in Casablanca  recreating all the shots. This film tried to find a balance between telling a political story  but also a feminine story. Being a visual artist  indeed  I am foremost interested to make art    to make art that transcends politics  religion  the question of feminism  and become an important  timeless  universal work of art. The challenge I have is how to do that. How to tell a political story but an allegorical story. How to move you with your emotions  but also make your mind work. These are some of the images and the characters of the film. Now comes the green movement    the summer of       as my film is released    the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran. What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film  the cry for democracy and social justice  repeats itself now again in Tehran. The green movement significantly inspired the world. It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy. What was most significant for me was  once again  the presence of the women. They're absolutely inspirational for me. If in the Islamic Revolution  the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn't have a voice  now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of Tehran    women who were educated  forward thinking  non traditional  sexually open  fearless and seriously feminist. These women and those young men united Iranians across the world  inside and outside. I then discovered why I take so much inspiration from Iranian women. That  under all circumstances  they have pushed the boundary. They have confronted the authority. They have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way. And once again  they proved themselves. I stand here to say that Iranian women have found a new voice  and their voice is giving me my voice. And it's a great honor to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist  even if I have to operate in the West only for now. Thank you so much. A few weeks ago  I had a chance to go to Saudi Arabia. And the first thing I wanted to do as a Muslim was go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba  the holiest shrine of Islam. And I did that  I put on my ritualistic dress  I went to the holy mosque  I did my prayers  I observed all the rituals. And meanwhile  besides all the spirituality  there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba that was pretty interesting for me. There was no separation of sexes. In other words  men and women were worshiping all together. They were together while doing the tawaf  the circular walk around the Kaaba. They were together while praying. And if you wonder why this is interesting at all  you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia because it's a country which is strictly divided between the sexes. In other words  as men  you are not simply supposed to be in the same physical space with women. And I noticed this in a very funny way. I left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca. I headed to the nearest Burger King restaurant. And I went there    I noticed that there was a male section  which was carefully separated from the female section. And I had to pay  order and eat at the male section.  It's funny   I said to myself   You can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy Kaaba  but not at the Burger King.  Quite ironic. Ironic  and it's also  I think  quite telling. Because the Kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of Islam  that of prophet Muhammad. And if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women  the rituals around the Kaaba could have been designed accordingly. But apparently that was not an issue at the time. So the rituals came that way. This is also  I think  confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the Koran  the very core of Islam    the divine core of Islam that all Muslims  and equally myself  believe. And I think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam. Because many scholars who study the history of Islamic thought    Muslim scholars or Westerners    think that actually the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in Islam  as Muslims adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the Middle East. Seclusion of women was actually a Byzantine and Persian practice  and Muslims adopted that and made that a part of their religion. And actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon. What we call today Islamic Law  and especially Islamic culture    and there are many Islamic cultures actually  the one in Saudi Arabia is much different from where I come from in Istanbul or Turkey. But still  if you're going to speak about a Muslim culture  this has a core  the divine message  which began the religion  but then many traditions  perceptions  many practices were added on top of it. And these were traditions of the Middle East    medieval traditions. And there are two important messages  or two lessons  to take from that reality. First of all  Muslims    pious  conservative  believing Muslims who want to be loyal to their religion    should not cling onto everything in their culture  thinking that that's divinely mandated. Maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed. On the other hand  the Westerners who look at Islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains. Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culture that became confused with Islam. There is a practice called female circumcision. It's something terrible  horrible. It is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure. And Westerners  Europeans or Americans  who didn't know about this before faced this practice within some of the Muslim communities who migrated from North Africa. And they've thought   Oh  what a horrible religion that is which ordains something like that.  But actually when you look at female circumcision  you see that it has nothing to do with Islam  it's just a North African practice  which predates Islam. It was there for thousands of years. And quite tellingly  some Muslims do practice that. The Muslims in North Africa  not in other places. But also the non Muslim communities of North Africa    the Animists  even some Christians and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa is known to practice female circumcision. So what might look like a problem within Islamic faith might turn out to be a tradition that Muslims have subscribed to. The same thing can be said for honor killings  which is a recurrent theme in the Western media    and which is  of course  a horrible tradition. And we see truly in some Muslim communities that tradition. But in the non Muslim communities of the Middle East  such as some Christian communities  Eastern communities  you see the same practice. We had a tragic case of an honor killing within Turkey's Armenian community just a few months ago. Now these are things about general culture  but I'm also very much interested in political culture and whether liberty and democracy is appreciated  or whether there's an authoritarian political culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens. And it is no secret that many Islamic movements in the Middle East tend to be authoritarian  and some of the so called  Islamic regimes  such as Saudi Arabia  Iran and the worst case was the Taliban in Afghanistan    they are pretty authoritarian. No doubt about that. For example  in Saudi Arabia there is a phenomenon called the religious police. And the religious police imposes the supposed Islamic way of life on every citizen  by force    like women are forced to cover their heads    wear the hijab  the Islamic head cover. Now that is pretty authoritarian  and that's something I'm very much critical of. But when I realized that the non Muslim  or the non Islamic minded actors in the same geography  sometimes behaved similarly  I realized that the problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region  not just Islam. Let me give you an example  in Turkey where I come from  which is a very hyper secular republic  until very recently we used to have what I call secularism police  which would guard the universities against veiled students. In other words  they would force students to uncover their heads  and I think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it. It should be the citizen's decision. But when I saw that  I said   Maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region  and some Muslims have been influenced by that. But the secular minded people can be influenced by that. Maybe it's a problem of the political culture  and we have to think about how to change that political culture.  Now these are some of the questions I had in mind a few years ago when I sat down to write a book. I said   Well I will make a research about how Islam actually came to be what it is today  and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken.  The name of the book is  Islam Without Extremes  A Muslim Case for Liberty.  And as the subtitle suggests  I looked at Islamic tradition and the history of Islamic thought from the perspective of individual liberty  and I tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty. And there are strengths in Islamic tradition. Islam actually  as a monotheistic religion  which defined man as a responsible agent by itself  created the idea of the individual in the Middle East and saved it from the communitarianism  the collectivism of the tribe. You can derive many ideas from that. But besides that  I also saw problems within Islamic tradition. But one thing was curious  most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later  not from the very divine core of Islam  the Koran  but from  again  traditions and mentalities  or the interpretations of the Koran that Muslims made in the Middle Ages. The Koran  for example  doesn't condone stoning. There is no punishment on apostasy. There is no punishment on personal things like drinking. These things which make Islamic Law  the troubling aspects of Islamic Law  were later developed into later interpretations of Islam. Which means that Muslims can  today  look at those things and say   Well  the core of our religion is here to stay with us. It's our faith  and we will be loyal to it. But we can change how it was interpreted  because it was interpreted according to the time and milieu in the Middle Ages. Now we are living in a different world with different values and different political systems.  That interpretation is quite possible and feasible. Now if I were the only person thinking that way  we would be in trouble. But that's not the case at all. Actually  from the   th century on  there's a whole revisionist  reformist    whatever you call it    tradition  a trend in Islamic thinking. And these were intellectuals or statesmen of the   th century  and later    th century  which looked at Europe basically and saw that Europe has many things to admire  like science and technology. But not just that  also democracy  parliament  the idea of representation  the idea of equal citizenship. These Muslim thinkers and intellectuals and statesmen of the   th century looked at Europe  saw these things. They said   Why don't we have these things   And they looked back at Islamic tradition  they saw that there are problematic aspects  but they're not the core of the religion  so maybe they can be re understood  and the Koran can be reread in the modern world. That trend is generally called Islamic modernism  and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen  not just as an intellectual idea though  but also as a political program. And that's why actually in the   th century the Ottoman Empire  which then covered the whole Middle East  made very important reforms    reforms like giving Christians and Jews an equal citizenship status  accepting a constitution  accepting a representative parliament  advancing the idea of freedom of religion. And that's why the Ottoman Empire in its last decades turned into a proto democracy  a constitutional monarchy  and freedom was a very important political value at the time. Similarly  in the Arab world  there was what the great Arab historian Albert Hourani defines as the Liberal Age. He has a book   Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age   and the Liberal Age  he defines as   th century and early   th century. Quite notably  this was the dominant trend in the early   th century among Islamic thinkers and statesmen and theologians. But there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the   th century  because we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modernist line. And in place of that  what happens is that Islamism grows as an ideology which is authoritarian  which is quite strident  which is quite anti Western  and which wants to shape society based on a utopian vision. So Islamism is the problematic idea that really created a lot of problems in the   th century Islamic world. And even the very extreme forms of Islamism led to terrorism in the name of Islam    which is actually a practice that I think is against Islam  but some  obviously  extremists did not think that way. But there is a curious question  If Islamic modernism was so popular in the   th and early   th centuries  why did Islamism become so popular in the rest of the   th century  And this is a question  I think  which needs to be discussed carefully. And in my book  I went into that question as well. And actually you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that. You just look at the political history of the   th century  and you see things have changed a lot. The context has changed. In the   th century  when Muslims were looking at Europe as an example  they were independent  they were more self confident. In the early   th century  with the fall of the Ottoman Empire  the whole Middle East was colonized. And when you have colonization what do you have  You have anti colonization. So Europe is not just an example now to emulate  it's an enemy to fight and to resist. So there's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the Muslim world  and what you see is more of a defensive  rigid  reactionary strain  which led to Arab socialism  Arab nationalism and ultimately to the Islamist ideology. And when the colonial period ended  what you had in place of that was  generally  secular dictators  which say they're a country  but did not bring democracy to the country  and established their own dictatorship. And I think the West  at least some powers in the West  particularly the United States  made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators  thinking that they were more helpful for their interests. But the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed Islamic groups in their country actually made the Islamists much more strident. So in the   th century  you had this vicious cycle in the Arab world where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people including the Islamic pious  and they're reacting in reactionary ways. There was one country  though  which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle. And that's the country where I come from  that's Turkey. Turkey has never been colonized  so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. That's one thing to remember. They did not share the same anti colonial hype that you can find in some other countries in the region. Secondly  and most importantly  Turkey became a democracy earlier than any of the countries we are talking about. In       Turkey had the first free and fair elections  which ended the more autocratic secular regime  which was the beginning of Turkey. And the pious Muslims in Turkey saw that they can change the political system by voting. And they realize that democracy is something that is compatible with Islam  compatible with their values  and they've been supportive of democracy. That's an experience that not every other Muslim nation in the Middle East had until very recently. Secondly  in the past two decades  thanks to globalization  thanks to the market economy  thanks to the rise of a middle class  we in Turkey see what I define as a rebirth of Islamic modernism. Now there's the more urban middle class pious Muslims who  again  look at their tradition and see that there are some problems in the tradition  and they understand that they need to be changed and questioned and reformed. And they look at Europe  and they see an example  again  to follow. They see an example  at least  to take some inspiration from. That's why the E.U. process  Turkey's effort to join the E.U.  has been supported inside Turkey by the Islamic pious  while some secular nations were against that. Well that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all Europeans are that welcoming    but that's another discussion. But the pro E.U. sentiment in Turkey in the past decade has become almost an Islamic cause and supported by the Islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well  of course. And thanks to that  Turkey has been able to reasonably create a success story in which Islam and the most pious understandings of Islam have become part of the democratic game  and even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country. And this has been an inspiring example right now for some of the Islamic movements or some of the countries in the Arab world. You must have all seen the Arab Spring  which began in Tunis and in Egypt. And Arab masses just revolted against their dictators. They were asking for democracy  they were asking for freedom. And they did not turn out to be the Islamist boogyman that the dictators were always using to justify their regime. They said that  we want freedom  we want democracy. We are Muslim believers  but we want to be living as free people in free societies.  Of course  this is a long road. Democracy is not an overnight achievement  it's a process. But this is a promising era in the Muslim world. And I believe that the Islamic modernism which began in the   th century  but which had a setback in the   th century because of the political troubles of the Muslim world  is having a rebirth. And I think the getaway message from that would be that Islam  despite some of the skeptics in the West  has the potential in itself to create its own way to democracy  create its own way to liberalism  create its own way to freedom. They just should be allowed to work for that. Thanks so much. Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see. A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task  until now. Hello  my name is Dennis Hong  and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired. So before I talk about this car for the blind  let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge. Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself. You press start  nobody touches anything  and it can reach its destination fully autonomously. So in       our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition. So about that time  the National Federation of the Blind  or NFB  challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently. We decided to give it a try  because we thought   Hey  how hard could it be   We have already an autonomous vehicle. We just put a blind person in it and we're done  right  We couldn't have been more wrong. What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around  but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive. So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch. So to test this crazy idea  we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility. And in the summer of       we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin. It was an absolutely amazing experience. But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment  in a flat  closed off parking lot    even the lanes defined by red traffic cones. So with this success  we decided to take the next big step  to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads. So how does it work  Well  it's a rather complex system  but let me try to explain it  maybe simplify it. So we have three steps. We have perception  computation and non visual interfaces. Now obviously the driver cannot see  so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver. For that  we use an initial measurement unit. So it measures acceleration  angular acceleration    like a human ear  inner ear. We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car. We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road. And we also use three laser range finders. The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles    a car approaching from the front  the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads  any obstacles around the vehicle. So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer  and the computer can do two things. One is  first of all  process this information to have an understanding of the environment    these are the lanes of the road  there's the obstacles    and convey this information to the driver. The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car. So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle. But the problem is this  How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive  So for this  we developed many different types of non visual user interface technology. So starting from a three dimensional ping sound system  a vibrating vest  a click wheel with voice commands  a leg strip  even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot. But today we're going to talk about three of these non visual user interfaces. Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip. So these are a pair of gloves  and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer    the direction and the intensity. Another device is called SpeedStrip. So this is a chair    as a matter of fact  it's actually a massage chair. We gut it out  and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns  and we actuate them to convey information about the speed  and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal. So over here  you can see how the computer understands the environment  and because you cannot see the vibration  we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening. This is the sensory data  and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer. So these two devices  DriveGrip and SpeedStrip  are very effective. But the problem is these are instructional cue devices. So this is not really freedom  right  The computer tells you how to drive    turn left  turn right  speed up  stop. We call this the  backseat driver problem.  So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices  and we're now focusing more on the informational devices. A good example for this informational non visual user interface is called AirPix. So think of it as a monitor for the blind. So it's a small tablet  has many holes in it  and compressed air comes out  so it can actually draw images. So even though you are blind  you can put your hand over it  you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles. Actually  you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature. So it's actually a multi dimensional user interface. So here you can see the left camera  the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix. For this  we're showing a simulator  a blind person driving using the AirPix. This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non visual user interfaces. So basically that's how it works. So just a month ago  on January   th  we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world famous Daytona International Speedway during the Rolex    racing event. We also had some surprises. Let's take a look. He's coming up to the grandstand  fellow Federationists. There's the grandstand now. And he's  unclear  following that van that's out in front of him. Well there comes the first box. Now let's see if Mark avoids it. He does. He passes it on the right. Third box is out. The fourth box is out. And he's perfectly making his way between the two. He's closing in on the van to make the moving pass. Well this is what it's all about  this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity. He's approaching the end of the run  makes his way between the barrels that are set up there. Dennis Hong  I'm so happy for you. Mark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel. Mark Riccobono  Yes. DH  So since we started this project  we've been getting hundreds of letters  emails  phone calls from people from all around the world. Letters thanking us  but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one   Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive up ATM machine.  But sometimes    But sometimes I also do get    I wouldn't call it hate mail    but letters of really strong concern   Dr. Hong  are you insane  trying to put blind people on the road  You must be out of your mind.  But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle  and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as  or safer than  today's vehicle. And I truly believe that this can happen. But still  will the society  would they accept such a radical idea  How are we going to handle insurance  How are we going to issue driver's licenses  There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality. Of course  the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind. But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin off technology that can come from this project. The sensors that are used can see through the dark  the fog and rain. And together with this new type of interfaces  we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people. Or for the blind  everyday home appliances    in the educational setting  in the office setting. Just imagine  in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non visual interfaces. This is priceless. So today  the things I've showed you today  is just the beginning. Thank you very much.
