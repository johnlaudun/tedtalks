By the end of this year  there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites. The one thing that all of them have in common is that they're going to die. While that might be a somewhat morbid thought  I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring. What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller  who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer. And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died. Here's what he wrote in starting that out. He said   Here it is. I'm dead  and this is my last post to my blog. In advance  I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer  then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote    the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive.  Now  while as a journalist  Miller's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most  the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that's something completely different than anything that's been created by any previous generation. Consider a few stats for a moment. Right now there are    hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute. There are     million Tweets being posted every day. And the average Facebook user is creating    pieces of content each month. So when you think about your parents or your grandparents  at best they may have created some photos or home videos  or a diary that lives in a box somewhere. But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely  years after we're gone. And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists. Now to be clear  I'm a journalist and not a technologist  so what I'd like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like. Now we're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die. One of them actually  fittingly enough  found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare. Death  Adam  AO  Yeah. Death  Death can catch you anywhere  anytime  even at the Organic. AO  Who is this  Death  Go to ifidie.net before it's too late. Adam Ostrow  Kind of creepy  right  So what that service does  quite simply  is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die. Another service right now is called       Memories. And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones  complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die. But what I think comes next is far more interesting. Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who  back in March  demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than        hours of home video. I think as machines' ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve  it's going to become possible to analyze an entire life's worth of content    the Tweets  the photos  the videos  the blog posts    that we're producing in such massive numbers. And I think as that happens  it's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating and technology's ability to make sense of it all. Now we're already starting to see some experiments here. One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream  everything you've posted onto Twitter  to make some predictions as to what you might say next. Well right now  as you can see  the results can be somewhat comical. You can imagine what something like this might look like five     or    years from now as our technical capabilities improve. Taking it a step further  MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans. But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime  Finally  think back to this famous scene from election night      back in the United States  where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper. What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms    interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive  I think that's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we're producing and technology's ability to understand it both expand exponentially. Now in closing  I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality    and if so  what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it. Thank you very much. Do you know that we have  .  million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide  And these are base stations. And we also have more than five billion of these devices here. These are cellular mobile phones. And with these mobile phones  we transmit more than     terabytes of data every month. This is a   with    zeroes    a very large number. And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water. We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now    in our private lives  in our business lives. And we even have to be asked sometimes  very kindly  to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons. And it's this importance why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has  because it's so fundamental to our lives. And one of the issues is capacity. The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves    in particular  radio waves. And radio waves are limited. They are scarce  they are expensive  and we only have a certain range of it. And it's this limitation that doesn't cope with the demand of wireless data transmissions and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month. And we are simply running out of spectrum. There's another problem. That is efficiency. These  .  million cellular radio masts  or base stations  consume a lot of energy. And mind you  most of the energy is not used to transmit the radio waves  it is used to cool the base stations. Then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent. And that creates a big problem. Then there's another issue that you're all aware of. You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights. In hospitals  they are security issues. And security is another issue. These radio waves penetrate through walls. They can be intercepted  and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad intentions. So these are the main four issues. But on the other hand  we have    billion of these  light bulbs  light. And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum. So let's look at this in the context of the entire electromagnetic spectrum  where we have gamma rays. You don't want to get close to gamma rays  it could be dangerous. X rays  useful when you go to hospitals. Then there's ultraviolet light. it's good for a nice suntan  but otherwise dangerous for the human body. Infrared    due to eye safety regulations  can be only used with low power. And then we have the radio waves  they have the issues I've just mentioned. And in the middle there  we have this visible light spectrum. It's light  and light has been around for many millions of years. And in fact  it has created us  has created life  has created all the stuff of life. So it's inherently safe to use. And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications  Not only that  I compared  it to  the entire spectrum. I compared the radio waves spectrum    the size of it    with the size of the visible light spectrum. And guess what  We have        times more of that spectrum  which is there for us to use. So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum  let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned. We have  .  million expensively deployed  inefficient radio cellular base stations. And multiply that by         then you end up at    billion.    billion is the number of light bulbs installed already. So we have the infrastructure there. Look at the ceiling  you see all these light bulbs. Go to the main floor  you see these light bulbs. Can we use them for communications  Yes. What do we need to do  The one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs  florescent lights  with this new technology of LED  LED light bulbs. An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device. And it has a very nice acute property. Its intensity can be modulated at very high speeds  and it can be switched off at very high speeds. And this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology. So let's show how we do that. Let's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum    go to remote controls. You all know remote controls have an infrared LED    basically you switch on the LED  and if it's off  you switch it off. And it creates a simple  low speed data stream in        bits per second         bits per second. Not usable for a YouTube video. What we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can furthermore replace the remote control of our light bulb. We transmit with our technology  not only a single data stream  we transmit thousands of data streams in parallel  at even higher speeds. And the technology we have developed    it's called SIM OFDM. And it's spacial modulation    these are the only technical terms  I'm not going into details    but this is how we enabled that light source to transmit data. You will say   Okay  this is nice    a slide created in    minutes.  But not only that. What we've done is we have also developed a demonstrator. And I'm showing for the first time in public this visible light demonstrator. And what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp. We fit in an LED light bulb  worth three U.S. dollars  put in our signal processing technology. And then what we have here is a little hole. And the light goes through that hole. There's a receiver. The receiver will convert these little  subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there into an electrical signal. And that signal is then converted back to a high speed data stream. In the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smart phones. And not only integrate a photo detector here  but maybe use the camera inside. So what happens when I switch on that light  As you would expect  it's a light  a desk lamp. Put your book beneath it and you can read. It's illuminating the space. But at the same time  you see this video coming up here. And that's a video  a high definition video that is transmitted through that light beam. You're critical. You think   Ha  ha  ha. This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here.  But let me do this. Once again. Still don't believe  It is this light that transmits this high definition video in a split stream. And if you look at the light  it is illuminating as you would expect. You don't notice with your human eye. You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we impress onto this light bulb. It's serving the purpose of illumination  but at the same time  we are able to transmit this data. And you see  even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver. It can ignore that constant light  because all the receiver's interested in are subtle changes. You also have a critical question now  and you say   Okay  do I have to have the light on all the time to have this working   And the answer is yes. But  you can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off. And you are still able to transmit data    that's possible. So I've mentioned to you the four challenges. Capacity  We have        times more spectrum         times more LEDs installed already in the infrastructure there. You would agree with me  hopefully  there's no issue of capacity anymore. Efficiency  This is data through illumination    it's first of all an illumination device. And if you do the energy budget  the data transmission comes for free    highly energy efficient. I don't mention the high energy efficiency of these LED light bulbs. If the whole world would deploy them  you would save hundreds of power plants. That's aside. And then I've mentioned the availability. You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital. You need to see what to do. You have lights in an aircraft. So it's everywhere in a day there is light. Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone. It has a flashlight  an LED flashlight. These are potential sources for high speed data transmission. And then there's security. You would agree with me that light doesn't penetrate through walls. So no one  if I have a light here  if I have secure data  no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data. And there's only data where there is light. So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data  then what I could do  turn it away. So the data goes in that direction  not there anymore. Now we can in fact see where the data is going to. So for me  the applications of it  to me  are beyond imagination at the moment. We have had a century of very nice  smart application developers. And you only have to notice  where we have light  there is a potential way to transmit data. But I can give you a few examples. Well you may see the impact already now. This is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean. And they use light to illuminate space down there. And this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things  use  to communicate with each other. Intrinsically safe environments like this petrochemical plant    you can't use RF  it may generate antenna sparks  but you can use light    you see plenty of light there. In hospitals  for new medical instruments  in streets for traffic control. Cars have LED based headlights  LED based back lights  and cars can communicate with each other and prevent accidents in the way that they exchange information. Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on. And then you have these millions of street lamps deployed around the world. And every street lamp could be a free access point. We call it  in fact  a Li Fi  light fidelity. And then we have these aircraft cabins. There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin  and each of these lights could be a potential transmitter of wireless data. So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video on your long flight back home. Online life. So that is a vision  I think  that is possible. So  all we would need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device. And this would then combine two basic functionalities  illumination and wireless data transmission. And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe could solve the four essential problems that face us in wireless communication these days. And in the future  you would not only have    billion light bulbs  you may have    billion Li Fis deployed worldwide    for a cleaner  a greener  and even a brighter future. Thank you. Each of you possesses the most powerful  dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised. It's a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people's minds. I'm talking about your language  of course  because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind  and they can attempt to do the same to you  without either of you having to perform surgery. Instead  when you speak  you're actually using a form of telemetry not so different from the remote control device for your television. It's just that  whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light  your language relies on pulses  discrete pulses  of sound. And just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood  you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else's brain to suit your interests. Languages are genes talking  getting things that they want. And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that  merely by uttering a sound  it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic  and maybe even into its mouth. Now language's subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship  in books you can't read  phrases you can't use and words you can't say. In fact  the Tower of Babel story in the Bible is a fable and warning about the power of language. According to that story  early humans developed the conceit that  by using their language to work together  they could build a tower that would take them all the way to heaven. Now God  angered at this attempt to usurp his power  destroyed the tower  and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt  he scattered the people by giving them different languages    confused them by giving them different languages. And this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating. Even today  we know that there are words we cannot use  phrases we cannot say  because if we do so  we might be accosted  jailed  or even killed. And all of this from a puff of air emanating from our mouths. Now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there's something worth explaining. And that is how and why did this remarkable trait evolve  and why did it evolve only in our species  Now it's a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question  we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees. Now these chimpanzees are using tools  and we take that as a sign of their intelligence. But if they really were intelligent  why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground rather than a shovel  And if they really were intelligent  why would they crack open nuts with a rock  Why wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts that somebody else had already cracked open for them  Why not  I mean  that's what we do. Now the reason the chimpanzees don't do that is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call social learning. They seem to lack the ability to learn from others by copying or imitating or simply watching. As a result  they can't improve on others' ideas or learn from others' mistakes    benefit from others' wisdom. And so they just do the same thing over and over and over again. In fact  we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing with the same sticks for the termites and the same rocks to crack open the nuts. Now this may sound arrogant  or even full of hubris. How do we know this  Because this is exactly what our ancestors  the Homo erectus  did. These upright apes evolved on the African savanna about two million years ago  and they made these splendid hand axes that fit wonderfully into your hands. But if we look at the fossil record  we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years. You can follow it through the fossil record. Now if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived  what their generation time was  that's about        generations of parents to offspring  and other individuals watching  in which that hand axe didn't change. It's not even clear that our very close genetic relatives  the Neanderthals  had social learning. Sure enough  their tools were more complicated than those of Homo erectus  but they too showed very little change over the         years or so that those species  the Neanderthals  lived in Eurasia. Okay  so what this tells us is that  contrary to the old adage   monkey see  monkey do   the surprise really is that all of the other animals really cannot do that    at least not very much. And even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it    something from a Barnum   Bailey circus. But by comparison  we can learn. We can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do. We can then choose  from among a range of options  the best one. We can benefit from others' ideas. We can build on their wisdom. And as a result  our ideas do accumulate  and our technology progresses. And this cumulative cultural adaptation  as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas  is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives. I mean the world has changed out of all proportion to what we would recognize even       or       years ago. And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation. The chairs you're sitting in  the lights in this auditorium  my microphone  the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you    all are a result of cumulative cultural adaptation. Now to many commentators  cumulative cultural adaptation  or social learning  is job done  end of story. Our species can make stuff  therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has. In fact  we can even make the  stuff of life     as I just said  all the stuff around us. But in fact  it turns out that some time around         years ago  when our species first arose and acquired social learning  that this was really the beginning of our story  not the end of our story. Because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma  the resolution of which  it's fair to say  would determine not only the future course of our psychology  but the future course of the entire world. And most importantly for this  it'll tell us why we have language. And the reason that dilemma arose is  it turns out  that social learning is visual theft. If I can learn by watching you  I can steal your best ideas  and I can benefit from your efforts  without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them. If I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish  or I can watch how you flake your hand axe to make it better  or if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch  I can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills  and maybe even catch that fish before you do. Social learning really is visual theft. And in any species that acquired it  it would behoove you to hide your best ideas  lest somebody steal them from you. And so some time around         years ago  our species confronted this crisis. And we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring. One of those options was that we could have retreated into small family groups. Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge would flow just to our relatives. Had we chosen this option  sometime around         years ago  we would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were when we first entered Europe        years ago. And this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas  there are fewer innovations. And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck. So if we'd chosen that path  our evolutionary path would have led into the forest    and been a short one indeed. The other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others. Choosing this option would mean that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom would become available to any one individual than would ever arise from within an individual family or an individual person on their own. Well  we chose the second option  and language is the result. Language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft. Language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation    for reaching agreements  for striking deals and for coordinating our activities. And you can see that  in a developing society that was beginning to acquire language  not having language would be a like a bird without wings. Just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit  language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit. And we take this utterly for granted  because we're a species that is so at home with language  but you have to realize that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in are utterly dependent upon language. And to see why  consider two scenarios from early in our evolution. Let's imagine that you are really good at making arrowheads  but you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached. Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts  but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads. So what you do is    one of those people has not really acquired language yet. And let's pretend the other one is good at language skills. So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads  and you walk up to the one that can't speak very well  and you put the arrowheads down in front of him  hoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows. But he looks at the pile of arrowheads  thinks they're a gift  picks them up  smiles and walks off. Now you pursue this guy  gesticulating. A scuffle ensues and you get stabbed with one of your own arrowheads. Okay  now replay this scene now  and you're approaching the one who has language. You put down your arrowheads and say   I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you      .  The other one says   Fine. Looks good to me. We'll do that.  Now the job is done. Once we have language  we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we couldn't have before we acquired it. And this is why our species has prospered around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zoos  languishing. That's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extract termites. All right  if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual theft is true  any species that acquires it should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity. And this is exactly what the archeological record shows. If you look at our ancestors  the Neanderthals and the Homo erectus  our immediate ancestors  they're confined to small regions of the world. But when our species arose about         years ago  sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa and spread around the entire world  occupying nearly every habitat on Earth. Now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to  with social learning and language  we could transform the environment to suit our needs. And so we prospered in a way that no other animal has. Language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved. It is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised. Language really is the voice of our genes. Now having evolved language  though  we did something peculiar  even bizarre. As we spread out around the world  we developed thousands of different languages. Currently  there are about seven or       different languages spoken on Earth. Now you might say  well  this is just natural. As we diverge  our languages are naturally going to diverge. But the real puzzle and irony is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth is found where people are most tightly packed together. If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea  we can find about     to       distinct human languages  different human languages  spoken on that island alone. There are places on that island where you can encounter a new language every two or three miles. Now  incredible as this sounds  I once met a Papuan man  and I asked him if this could possibly be true. And he said to me   Oh no. They're far closer together than that.  And it's true  there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language in under a mile. And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands. And so it seems that we use our language  not just to cooperate  but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities  and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside. And we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures  we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups. They slow the flow of technologies. And they even slow the flow of genes. Now I can't speak for you  but it seems to be the case that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to. Now we have to counter that  though  against the evidence we've heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans. Okay  this tendency we have  this seemingly natural tendency we have  towards isolation  towards keeping to ourselves  crashes head first into our modern world. This remarkable image is not a map of the world. In fact  it's a map of Facebook friendship links. And when you plot those friendship links by their latitude and longitude  it literally draws a map of the world. Our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past. And that communication  that connectivity around the world  that globalization now raises a burden. Because these different languages impose a barrier  as we've just seen  to the transfer of goods and ideas and technologies and wisdom. And they impose a barrier to cooperation. And nowhere do we see that more clearly than in the European Union  whose    member countries speak    official languages. The European Union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their    official languages. That's something on the order of  .   billion U.S. dollars on translation costs alone. Now think of the absurdity of this situation. If    individuals from those    member states sat around table  speaking their    languages  some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of     translators to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities. The European Union employs a permanent staff of about       translators. And in      alone    and I'm sure there are more recent figures    something on the order of  .  million pages were translated into English alone. And so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft  if language really is the conduit of our cooperation  the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas  in our modern world  we confront a question. And that question is whether in this modern  globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages. To put it this way  nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist. One of them always drives the other extinct. And we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization. There are lots and lots of ways of measuring things    weighing them and measuring their length    but the metric system is winning. There are lots and lots of ways of measuring time  but a really bizarre base    system known as hours and minutes and seconds is nearly universal around the world. There are many  many ways of imprinting CDs or DVDs  but those are all being standardized as well. And you can probably think of many  many more in your own everyday lives. And so our modern world now is confronting us with a dilemma. And it's the dilemma that this Chinese man faces  who's language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language  and yet he is sitting at his blackboard  converting Chinese phrases into English language phrases. And what this does is it raises the possibility to us that in a world in which we want to promote cooperation and exchange  and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before on cooperation to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity  his actions suggest to us it might be inevitable that we have to confront the idea that our destiny is to be one world with one language. Thank you. Matt Ridley  Mark  one question. Svante found that the FOXP  gene  which seems to be associated with language  was also shared in the same form in Neanderthals as us. Do we have any idea how we could have defeated Neanderthals if they also had language  Mark Pagel  This is a very good question. So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP  that seems to be implicated in some ways in the fine motor control that's associated with language. The reason why I don't believe that tells us that the Neanderthals had language is    here's a simple analogy  Ferraris are cars that have engines. My car has an engine  but it's not a Ferrari. Now the simple answer then is that genes alone don't  all by themselves  determine the outcome of very complicated things like language. What we know about this FOXP  and Neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths    who knows. But that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language. MR  Thank you very much indeed. Humans in the developed world spend more than    percent of their lives indoors  where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye  microorganisms. Buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us  and some that are bad for us. What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors  Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems. And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures. The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans  and with the human built environment. And today  architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us. We spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments  like this building here    environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering  heating and air conditioning. Given the amount of time that we spend indoors  it's important to understand how this affects our health. At the Biology and the Built Environment Center  we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the DNA out of microbes in the air. And we looked at three different types of rooms. We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated  which are the data points in the blue. We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated  where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable  but they made them operable for our study. And we also sampled the outdoor air. If you look at the x axis of this graph  you'll see that what we commonly want to do    which is keeping the outdoors out    we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation. So if you look at the green data points  which is air that's outside  you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity  or variety of microbial types. But if you look at the blue data points  which is mechanically ventilated air  it's not as diverse. But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health. If you look at the y axis of this graph  you'll see that  in the mechanically ventilated air  you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen  or germ  than if you're outdoors. So to understand why this was the case  we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram  which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples. The data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart. And the first things that you can see from this graph is  if you look at the blue data points  which are the mechanically ventilated air  they're not simply a subset of the green data points  which are the outdoor air. What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans. It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth  our spit. And this is because we're all constantly shedding microbes. So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another. And when you're outdoors  that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt. Why does this matter  It matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States. Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings. And the model that we're working with in hospitals  and also with many  many different buildings  is to keep the outdoors out. And this model may not necessarily be the best for our health. And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections  or hospital acquired infections  this is a clue that it's a good time to reconsider our current practices. So just as we manage national parks  where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others  we're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors. I've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut. And for this reason  many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora. And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside. Thank you. So today  I want us to reflect on the demise of guys. Guys are flaming out academically  they're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women. Other than that  there's not much of a problem. So what's the data  So the data on dropping out is amazing. Boys are    percent more likely than girls to drop out of school. In Canada  five boys drop out for every three girls. Girls outperform boys now at every level  from elementary school to graduate school. There's a    percent differential between getting BA's and all graduate programs  with guys falling behind girls. Two thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys. And as you all know  boys are five times more likely than girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder    and therefore we drug them with Ritalin. What's the evidence of wiping out  First  it's a new fear of intimacy. Intimacy means physical  emotional connection with somebody else    and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous  contradictory  phosphorescent signals. And every year there's research done on self reported shyness among college students. And we're seeing a steady increase among males. And this is two kinds. It's a social awkwardness. The old shyness was a fear of rejection. It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land. They don't know what to say  they don't know what to do  especially one on one  with the  opposite sex. They don't know the language of face contact  the non verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else  listen to somebody else. There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome  which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating. It turns out  from earliest childhood  boys  and then men  prefer the company of guys    physical company. And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at  because guys have been with guys in teams  in clubs  in gangs  in fraternities  especially in the military  and then in pubs. And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers  watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers  rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom. The problem is they now prefer  the  asynchronistic Internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships. What are the causes  Well  it's an unintended consequence. I think it's excessive Internet use in general  excessive video gaming  excessive new access to pornography. The problem is these are arousal addictions. Drug addiction  you simply want more. Arousal addiction  you want different. Drugs  you want more of the same    different. So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained. And the problem is the industry is supplying it. Jane McGonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is     he's played        hours of video games  most of that in isolation. As you remember  Cindy Gallop said men don't know the difference between making love and doing porn. The average boy now watches    porn video clips a week. And there's some guy watching a hundred  obviously. And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America       billion annually. For every     movies made in Hollywood  there are        now made porn videos. So the effect  very quickly  is it's a new kind of arousal. Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change  novelty  excitement and constant arousal. That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes  which are analog  static  interactively passive. They're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships  which build gradually and subtly. So what's the solution  It's not my job. I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve. But who should care  The only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls  educators  gamers  filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk to  who can dance  who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs. No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you. For a long time  there was me  and my body. Me was composed of stories  of cravings  of strivings  of desires of the future. Me was trying not to be an outcome of my violent past  but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome. Me was always trying to become something  somebody. Me only existed in the trying. My body was often in the way. Me was a floating head. For years  I actually only wore hats. It was a way of keeping my head attached. It was a way of locating myself. I worried that  if  I took my hat off I wouldn't be here anymore. I actually had a therapist who once said to me   Eve  you've been coming here for two years  and  to be honest  it never occurred to me that you had a body.  All this time I lived in the city because  to be honest  I was afraid of trees. I never had babies because heads cannot give birth. Babies actually don't come out of your mouth. As I had no reference point for my body  I began to ask other women about their bodies    in particular  their vaginas  because I thought vaginas were kind of important. This led to me writing  The Vagina Monologues   which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere I could. I did this in front of many strangers. One night on stage  I actually entered my vagina. It was an ecstatic experience. It scared me  it energized me  and then I became a driven person  a driven vagina. I began to see my body like a thing  a thing that could move fast  like a thing that could accomplish other things  many things  all at once. I began to see my body like an iPad or a car. I would drive it and demand things from it. It had no limits. It was invincible. It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself. I didn't heed it  no  I organized it and I directed it. I didn't have patience for my body  I snapped it into shape. I was greedy. I took more than my body had to offer. If I was tired  I drank more espressos. If I was afraid  I went to more dangerous places. Oh sure  sure  I had moments of appreciation of my body  the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness. My father was really kind to me on my   th birthday  for example. I heard people murmur from time to time that I should love my body  so I learned how to do this. I was a vegetarian  I was sober  I didn't smoke. But all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body    a further disassociation  like planting a vegetable field on a freeway. As a result of me talking so much about my vagina  many women started to tell me about theirs    their stories about their bodies. Actually  these stories compelled me around the world  and I've been to over    countries. I heard thousands of stories  and I have to tell you  there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body    when she left home. I heard about women being molested in their beds  flogged in their burqas  left for dead in parking lots  acid burned in their kitchens. Some women became quiet and disappeared. Other women became mad  driven machines like me. In the middle of my traveling  I turned    and I began to hate my body  which was actually progress  because at least my body existed enough to hate it. Well my stomach    it was my stomach I hated. It was proof that I had not measured up  that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape. My stomach was proof that I had failed  that it had failed me  that it was broken. My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it. In fact  it became so extreme I wrote a play about it. But the more I talked about it  the more objectified and fragmented my body became. It became entertainment  it became a new kind of commodity  something I was selling. Then I went somewhere else. I went outside what I thought I knew. I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo. And I heard stories that shattered all the other stories. I heard stories that got inside my body. I heard about a little girl who couldn't stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her. I heard an    year old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that. There are thousands of these stories  and many of the women had holes in their bodies    holes  fistula    that were the violation of war    holes in the fabric of their souls. These stories saturated my cells and nerves  and to be honest  I stopped sleeping for three years. All the stories began to bleed together. The raping of the Earth  the pillaging of minerals  the destruction of vaginas    none of these were separate anymore from each other or me. Militias were raping six month old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers. My body had not only become a driven machine  but it was responsible now for destroying other women's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine. Then I got cancer    or I found out I had cancer. It arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane. Suddenly  I had a body  a body that was pricked and poked and punctured  a body that was cut wide open  a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed  a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it  a body that was burning from chemicals. Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection. I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body was the crisis in the world  and it wasn't happening later  it was happening now. Suddenly  my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere  the cancer of cruelty  the cancer of greed  the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical plants    and they're usually poor    the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs  the cancer of stress for not achieving enough  the cancer of buried trauma  the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish  the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped  the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness. In his new and visionary book   New Self  New World   the writer Philip Shepherd says   If you are divided from your body  you are also divided from the body of the world  which then appears to be other than you or separate from you  rather than the living continuum to which you belong.  Before cancer  the world was something other. It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea. Now I am swimming in it. Now I lay down in the grass and I rub my body in it  and I love the mud on my legs and feet. Now I make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine  and I hunger for the green fields in the bush outside Bukavu. And when it rains hard rain  I scream and I run in circles. I know that everything is connected  and the scar that runs the length of my torso is the markings of the earthquake. And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port au Prince. And the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world. I know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation  the    ounces of puss  is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico  and there were oil drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish. And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the Earth cries out from the drilling. In my second chemo  my mother got very sick and I went to see her. And in the name of connectedness  the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico. So we brought her home  and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died. And gratefully  it didn't. And she died quietly in her favorite place. And a few weeks later  I was in New Orleans  and this beautiful  spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me. And I was honored. And I went to her house  and it was morning  and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains. And my friend was preparing this big bowl  and I said   What is it   And she said   It's for you. The flowers make it beautiful  and the honey makes it sweet.  And I said   But what's the water part   And in the name of connectedness  she said   Oh  it's the Gulf of Mexico.  And I said   Of course it is.  And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle  and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water. And she sang    I mean her whole body sang. And the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother. And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head  I realized that it held the best and the worst of us. It was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion. It was all the lies that got told before and after. It was the honey in the water that made it sweet  it was the oil that made it sick. It was my head that was bald    and comfortable now without a hat. It was my whole self melting into Michaela's lap. It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf that were falling down my cheek. It was finally being in my body. It was the sorrow that's taken so long. It was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection. It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world. It was the Congolese women who are now rising up. It was my mother leaving  just at the moment that I was being born. It was the realization that I had come very close to dying    in the same way that the Earth  our mother  is barely holding on  in the same way that    percent of the planet are hardly scraping by  in the same way that there is a recipe for survival. What I learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves. It was advocating friends and a doting sister. It was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands. It was underpaid and really loving nurses. It was magic healers and aromatic oils. It was people who came with spells and rituals. It was having a vision of the future and something to fight for  because I know this struggle isn't my own. It was a million prayers. It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms. It was a lot of anger  insane humor  a lot of attention  outrage. It was energy  love and joy. It was all these things. It was all these things. It was all these things in the water  in the world  in my body. Climate change is already a heavy topic  and it's getting heavier because we're understanding that we need to do more than we are. We're understanding  in fact  that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions. That's  to put it mildly  not what's on the table now. And it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face. And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us  we tend to seek simple answers. And I think this is what we've done with climate change. We look at where the emissions are coming from    they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth  and we say  okay  well the problem is that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning  so therefore  the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy. And while  of course  we do need clean energy  I would put to you that it's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem  we're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it. And the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing. That shouldn't be news to any of us. However  it's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization. By mid century  we're going to have about eight billion    perhaps more    people living in cities or within a day's travel of one. We will be an overwhelmingly urban species. In order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global North live in today  we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy. It may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy. So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet  we need to look somewhere else for the solution. The solution  in fact  may be closer to hand than we think  because all of those cities we're building are opportunities. Every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants. We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing    I choose to turn this light switch on    but really  enormous amounts of our energy use are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in. I won't show you very many graphs today  but if I can just focus on this one for a moment  it really tells us a lot of what we need to know    which is  quite simply  that if you look  for example  at transportation  a major category of climate emissions  there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air. And the correlation  of course  is that denser places tend to have lower emissions    which isn't really all that difficult to figure out  if you think about it. Basically  we substitute  in our lives  access to the things we want. We go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place. And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need. But when we live in a denser community  suddenly what we find  of course  is that the things we need are close by. And since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place  suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable. And it is possible  of course  to increase the density of the communities around us. Some places are doing this with new eco districts  developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods  which is nice work if you can get it  but most of the time  what we're talking about is  in fact  reweaving the urban fabric that we already have. So we're talking about things like infill development  really sharp little changes to where we have buildings  where we're developing. Urban retrofitting  creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there. Increasingly  we're realizing that we don't even need to densify an entire city. What we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don't drive as much and so on. And that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot. So you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city. And we find that when we do that  we can  in fact  have a few places that are really hyper dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results. Now we may find that there are places that are really  really dense and still hold onto their cars  but the reality is that  by and large  what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect  where people simply stop driving as much  and increasingly  more and more people  if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home  give up their cars altogether. And this is a huge  huge energy savings  because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars. We have the manufacture of the car  the disposal of the car  all of the parking and freeways and so on. When you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn't use any of them really  you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as    percent. And people are embracing this. All around the world  we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life. People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood. And when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see  what you find is  in fact  even more access suffused into spaces. Some of it's transportation access. This is a Mapnificent map that shows me  in this case  how far I can get from my home in    minutes using public transportation. Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet. This is Google Walking Maps. I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway  and it told me to go via Guernsey. It did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths  though. But the technologies are getting better  and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation. And as we just heard earlier  of course  we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects. Things that don't have any wiring in them at all  we're learning how to include in these systems of notation and navigation. Part of what we're finding with this is that what we thought was the major point of manufacturing and consumption  which is to get a bunch of stuff  is not  in fact  how we really live best in dense environments. What we're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things. My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill  a home power drill  Okay. I do too. The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and    minutes in its entire lifetime  depending on who you ask. And so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time  use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit. Our cities  I would put to you  are stockpiles of these surplus capacities. And while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities    such as cooking or making ice sculptures or even a mafia hit    what we probably will find is that  in fact  turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them  is a far smarter way to go. And in fact  even space itself is turning into a service. We're finding that people can share the same spaces  do stuff with vacant space. Buildings are becoming bundles of services. So we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on    like heating  cooling etc.    and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on. So we light our buildings with daylight. We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine. In fact  when we use all these things  what we've found is that  in some cases  energy use in a building can drop as much as    percent. Which brings on another threshold effect I like to call furnace dumping  which is  quite simply  if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace  you save a whole bunch of money up front. These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives. Now when we look at being able to slash our product use  slash our transportation use  slash our building energy use  all of that is great  but it still leaves something behind. And if we're going to really  truly become sustainable cities  we need to think a little differently. This is one way to do it. This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are. And certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery. So we have visions like this. We have visions like this. We have visions like this. Now all of these are fine projects  but they really have missed an essential point  which is it's not about the leaves above  it's about the systems below. Do they  for instance  capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use  Water is energy intensive. Do they  perhaps  include green infrastructure  so that we can take runoff and water that's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees  Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by  for example  connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration  Do they allow for pollination  pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities  Do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth  and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon    take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities  I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible  they're being done right now  and that it's a darn good thing. Because right now  our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawken said   by stealing the future  selling it in the present and calling it GDP.  And if we have another eight billion or seven billion  or six billion  even  people  living on a planet where their cities also steal the future  we're going to run out of future really fast. But if we think differently  I think that  in fact  we can have cities that are not only zero emissions  but have unlimited possibilities as well. Thank you very much. For as long as I can remember  I have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean. And at this age  my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin. And when I first learned about endangered species  I was truly distressed to know that every day animals were being wiped off the face of this Earth forever. And I wanted to do something to help  but I always wondered  what could one person possibly do to make a difference  And it would be    years  but I would eventually get the answer to that question. When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year during the horrific BP oil spill  a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying   We should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released.  And I could not disagree more. And in addition  I believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life. And I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this. On June   rd        a ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town  South Africa  spilling       tons of fuel  which polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population of African penguins. Now the ship sank between Robben Island to the south and Dassen Island to the north. And these are two of the penguins' main breeding islands. And exactly six years and three days earlier  on June   th        a ship named the Apollo Sea sank near Dassen Island  oiling        penguins    half of which died. Now when the Treasure sank in       it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the African penguin    which at the time  was listed as a threatened species. And soon  nearly        penguins were covered with this toxic oil. And the local seabird rescue center  named SANCCOB  immediately launched a massive rescue operation    and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken. Now at the time  I was working down the street. I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium. And exactly    years ago yesterday  the phone rang in the penguin office. And with that call  my life would change forever. It was Estelle van der Meer calling from SANCCOB  saying   Please come help. We have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing  but completely inexperienced  volunteers. And we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them.  So two days later  I was on a plane headed for Cape Town with a team of penguin specialists. And the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal. In fact  many people compared it to a war zone. And last week  a    year old girl asked me   What did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw so many oiled penguins   And this is what happened. I was instantly transported back to that moment in time. Penguins are very vocal birds and really  really noisy. And so I expected to walk into this building and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking  but instead  when we stepped through those doors and into the building  it was eerily silent. So it was very clear these were stressed  sick  traumatized birds. The other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers. Up to       people a day came to the rescue center  and eventually  over the course of this rescue  more than    and a half thousand volunteers came from all over the world to Cape Town to help save these birds. And the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there    yet they were. So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity  this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe inspiring. So the day after we arrived  two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two  and room two had more than       oiled penguins in it. Now mind you  three days earlier  we had    penguins under our care  so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified    at least I was. Personally  I really didn't know if I was capable of handling such a monstrous task. And collectively  we really didn't know if we could pull this off. Because we all knew that just six years earlier  half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued and only half of them had survived. So would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins  We just did not know. But what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers    three of whom here are force feeding penguins. And you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves. And what you should know about African penguins is that they have razor sharp beaks. And before long  our bodies were covered head to toe with these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins. Now the day after we arrived  a new crisis began to unfold. The oil slick was now moving north towards Dassen Island  and the rescuers despaired  because they knew if the oil hit  it would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds. And there really were no good solutions. But then finally  one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea. He said   Okay  why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled     they collected            and we'll ship them     miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home.  So three of those penguins    Peter  Pamela and Percy    wore satellite tags  and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home  the oil would be cleaned up from their islands. And luckily  the day they arrived  it was. So it had been a huge gamble  but it had paid off. And so they know now that they can use this strategy in future oil spills. So in wildlife rescue  as in life  we learn from each previous experience  and we learn from both our successes and our failures. And the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in '   was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks    because they just had not been prepared to deal with so many oiled penguins at once. So in these six years between these two oil spills  they built thousands of these well ventilated boxes  and as a result  during the Treasure rescue  just     penguins died during the transport process  as opposed to      . So this alone was a huge victory. Something else learned during the Apollo rescue was how to train the penguins to take fish freely from their hands  using these training boxes. And we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue. But an interesting thing was noted during the training process. The first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the Apollo Sea spill six years earlier. So penguins learn from previous experience  too. So all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies. And it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin. And when you clean a penguin  you first have to spray it with a degreaser. And this brings me to my favorite story from the Treasure rescue. About a year prior to this oil spill  a    year old student had invented a degreaser. And they'd been using it at SANCCOB with great success  so they began using it during the Treasure rescue. But part way through  they ran out. So in a panic  Estelle from SANCCOB called the student and said   Please  you have to make more.  So he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds. So I just think it is the coolest thing that a teenager invented a product that helped save the lives of thousands of animals. So what happened to those        oiled penguins  And was Silvia Gaus right  Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway  Well she could not be more wrong. After half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor  more than    percent of those oiled penguins were successfully returned to the wild. And we know from follow up studies that they have lived just as long as never oiled penguins  and bred nearly as successfully. And in addition  about       penguin chicks were rescued and hand raised. And again  we know from long term monitoring that more of these hand raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do parent raised chicks. So  armed with this knowledge  SANCCOB has a chick bolstering project. And every year they rescue and raise abandoned chicks  and they have a very impressive    percent success rate. And this is critically important because  one year ago  the African penguin was declared endangered. And they could be extinct in less than    years  if we don't do something now to protect them. So what did I learn from this intense and unforgettable experience  Personally  I learned that I am capable of handling so much more than I ever dreamed possible. And I learned that one person can make a huge difference. Just look at that    year old. And when we come together and work as one  we can achieve extraordinary things. And truly  to be a part of something so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding experience you can possibly have. So I'd like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge  if you will. My mission as the penguin lady is to raise awareness and funding to protect penguins  but why should any of you care about penguins  Well  you should care because they're an indicator species. And simply put  if penguins are dying  it means our oceans are dying  and we ultimately will be affected  because  as Sylvia Earle says   The oceans are our life support system.  And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming. And these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about. So if we each do our part  together  we can make a difference  and we can help keep penguins from going extinct. Humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins  but we are now their only hope. Thank you. I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world. I couldn't understand the starvation  the destruction  the killing of innocent people. Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do. And when I was     I became an actor. I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications. I was told I was dyslexic. In fact  I have got qualifications. I got a D in pottery  which was the one thing that I did get    which was useful  obviously. And so concern is where all of this comes from. And then  being an actor  I was doing these different kinds of things  and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in really wasn't cutting it  that there surely had to be more. And at that point  I read a book by Frank Barnaby  this wonderful nuclear physicist  and he said that media had a responsibility  that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward. And that fascinated me  because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life. And then I thought  well maybe I could do something. Maybe I could become a filmmaker. Maybe I can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference. Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in. So I started thinking about peace  and I was obviously  as I said to you  very much moved by these images  trying to make sense of that. Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on  Because it's obviously incredibly frightening. But I realized that  having been messing around with structure as an actor  that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough  that there needed to be a mountain to climb  there needed to be a journey that I had to take. And if I took that journey  no matter whether it failed or succeeded  it would be completely irrelevant. The point was that I would have something to hook the questions of    is humankind fundamentally evil  Is the destruction of the world inevitable  Should I have children  Is that a responsible thing to do  Etc.  etc. So I was thinking about peace  and then I was thinking  well where's the starting point for peace  And that was when I had the idea. There was no starting point for peace. There was no day of global unity. There was no day of intercultural cooperation. There was no day when humanity came together  separate in all of those things and just shared it together    that we're in this together  and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated  then that might be the key to humanity's survival. That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces    if we did it just for a day. So obviously we didn't have any money. I was living at my mom's place. And we started writing letters to everybody. You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do to fathom that out. How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day  the   st of September  And I wanted it to be the   st of September because it was my granddad's favorite number. He was a prisoner of war. He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki. It poisoned his blood. He died when I was   . So he was like my hero. And the reason why    was the number is     men left     came back  two died on the boat and    hit the ground. And that's why we wanted it to be the   st of September as the date of peace. So we began this journey  and we launched it in     . And we wrote to heads of state  their ambassadors  Nobel Peace laureates  NGOs  faiths  various organizations    literally wrote to everybody. And very quickly  some letters started coming back. And we started to build this case. And I remember the first letter. One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama. And of course we didn't have the money  we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of  this mail . A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying   This is an amazing thing. Come and see me. I'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace.  And we didn't have money for the flight. And I rang Sir Bob Ayling  who was CEO of BA at the time  and said   Mate  we've got this invitation. Could you give me a flight  Because we're going to go see him.  And of course  we went and saw him and it was amazing. And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward. And actually  let me go back to that slide  because when we launched it in         this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non violence    we invited thousands of people. Well not thousands    hundreds of people  lots of people    all the press  because we were going to try and create the first ever World Peace Day  a peace day. And we invited everybody  and no press showed up. There were     people there    they were mostly my friends and family. And that was kind of like the launch of this thing. But it didn't matter because we were documenting  and that was the thing. For me  it was really about the process. It wasn't about the end result. And that's the beautiful thing about the camera. They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword. I think the camera is. And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually. So anyway  we began the journey. And here you see people like Mary Robinson  I went to see in Geneva. I'm cutting my hair  it's getting short and long  because every time I saw Kofi Annan  I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it  and that was kind of what was going on. Yeah  I'm not worried about it now. So Mary Robinson  she said to me   Listen  this is an idea whose time has come. This must be created.  Kofi Annan said   This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground.  The OAU at the time  led by Salim Ahmed Salim  said   I must get the African countries involved.  Dr. Oscar Arias  Nobel Peace laureate  president now of Costa Rica  said   I'll do everything that I can.  So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States. I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks  and so on and so on and so on    while I was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense. And then we were listening to the people. We were documenting everywhere.    countries in the last    years  I've visited. And I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone. I've recorded        young people. I've recorded about     hours of their thoughts. I'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry  their art  their literature  their music  their sport  whatever it might be. And we were listening to everybody. And it was an incredibly thing  working with the U.N. and working with NGOs and building this case. I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day. And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was  the better chance we had of creating this day. And it was this stuff  this  where I actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened  it didn't actually matter. It didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace. The fact is that  if I tried and it didn't work  then I could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite    until  it was in Somalia  picking up that young girl. And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic  and that young boy who was a child soldier  who told me he'd killed people    he was about       these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop. And that actually  at that moment something happened to me  which obviously made me go   I'm going to document. If this is the only film that I ever make  I'm going to document until this becomes a reality.  Because we've got to stop  we've got to do something where we unite    separate from all the politics and religion that  as a young person  is confusing me. I don't know how to get involved in that process. And then on the seventh of September  I was invited to New York. The Costa Rican government and the British government had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly  with    co sponsors  the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day  the   st of September  as a fixed calendar date  and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world. Yeah  but there were hundreds of individuals  obviously  who made that a reality. And thank you to all of them. That was an incredible moment. I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen. And as I mentioned  when it started  we were at the Globe  and there was no press. And now I was thinking   Well  the press it really going to hear this story.  And suddenly  we started to institutionalize this day. Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the   th to do a press conference. And it was      AM when I stood there. And I was waiting for him to come down  and I knew that he was on his way. And obviously he never came down. The statement was never made. The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence. And it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives  there and then subsequently all over the world. It never happened. And I remember thinking   This is exactly why  actually  we have to work even harder. And we have to make this day work. It's been created  nobody knows. But we have to continue this journey  and we have to tell people  and we have to prove it can work.  And I left New York freaked  but actually empowered. And I felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did  then maybe we wouldn't see things like that. I remember putting that film out and going to cynics. I was showing the film  and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film    that it's just a day of peace  it doesn't mean anything. It's not going to work  you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan  the Taliban won't listen  etc.  etc. It's just symbolism. And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways  because it couldn't not work. I'd spoken in Somalia  Burundi  Gaza  the West Bank  India  Sri Lanka  Congo  wherever it was  and they'd all tell me   If you can create a window of opportunity  we can move aid  we can vaccinate children. Children can lead their projects. They can unite. They can come together. If people would stop  lives will be saved.  That's what I'd heard. And I'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about. And so I went back to the United Nations. I decided that I'd continue filming and make another movie. And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years. We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system  governments and NGOs  trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it  see if we could make it possible. And after lots and lots of meetings obviously  I'm delighted that this man  Ahmad Fawzi  one of my heroes and mentors really  he managed to get UNICEF involved. And UNICEF  God bless them  they said   Okay  we'll have a go.  And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan. It was historical. Could it work in Afghanistan with UNAMA and WHO and civil society  etc.  etc.  etc.  And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it  and I was thinking   This is it. This is the possibility of it maybe working. But even if it doesn't  at least the door is open and there's a chance.  And so I went back to London  and I went and saw this chap  Jude Law. And I saw him because he was an actor  I was an actor  I had a connection to him  because we needed to get to the press  we needed this attraction  we needed the media to be involved. Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there'd be more    when we got into certain areas  maybe there would be more people interested. And maybe we'd be helped financially a little bit more  which had been desperately difficult. I won't go into that. So Jude said   Okay  I'll do some statements for you.  While I was filming these statements  he said to me   Where are you going next   I said   I'm going to go to Afghanistan.  He said   Really   And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest. So I said to him   Do you want to come with me  It'd be really interesting if you came. It would help and bring attention. And that attention would help leverage the situation  as well as all of the other sides of it.  I think there's a number of pillars to success. One is you've got to have a great idea. The other is you've got to have a constituency  you've got to have finance  and you've got to be able to raise awareness. And actually I could never raise awareness by myself  no matter what I'd achieved. So these guys were absolutely crucial. So he said yes  and we found ourselves in Afghanistan. It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there  I was talking to various people  and they were saying to me   You've got to get everybody involved here. You can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work.  And we did  and we traveled around  and we spoke to elders  we spoke to doctors  we spoke to nurses  we held press conferences  we went out with soldiers  we sat down with ISAF  we sat down with NATO  we sat down with the U.K. government. I mean  we basically sat down with everybody    in and out of schools with ministers of education  holding these press conferences  which of course  now were loaded with press  everybody was there. There was an interest in what was going on. This amazing woman  Fatima Gailani  was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians. And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere. And she was really crucial in getting the message in. And then we went home. We'd sort of done it. We had to wait now and see what happened. And I got home  and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the Taliban. And that letter basically said   We'll observe this day. We will observe this day. We see it as a window of opportunity. And we will not engage. We're not going to engage.  And that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn't be kidnapped or killed. And then suddenly  I obviously knew at this point  there was a chance. And days later   .  million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping. And like the General Assembly  obviously the most wonderful  wonderful moment. And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back. We put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects. We went back to Afghanistan  because the next year was coming  and we wanted to support. But more importantly  we wanted to go back  because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes. They were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it  etc.  etc.    and they made it real. And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say   Look  you guys made this possible. And thank you very much.  And we gave the film over. Obviously it was shown  and it was amazing. And then that year  that year        this ISAF statement from Kabul  Afghanistan  September   th   General Stanley McChrystal  commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan  announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations on the   st of September.  They were saying they would stop. And then there was this other statement that came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety saying that  in Afghanistan  because of this work  the violence was down by    percent.    percent reduction in violence on this day at least. And that completely blew my mind almost more than anything. And I remember being stuck in New York  this time because of the volcano  which was obviously much less harmful. And I was there thinking about what was going on. And I kept thinking about this    percent.    percent reduction in violence    in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn't do. And that made me think that  if we can get    percent in Afghanistan  then surely we can get    percent reduction everywhere. We have to go for a global truce. We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce  go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities  both domestically and internationally  ever recorded. That's exactly what we must do. And on the   st of September this year  we're going to launch that campaign at the O  Arena to go for that process  to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities. And we will utilize all kinds of things    have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website  sign the petition. And it's in the six official languages of the United Nations. And we'll globally link with government  inter government  non government  education  unions  sports. And you can see the education box there. We've got resources at the moment in     countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce. And obviously the life saving is increased  the concepts help. Linking up with the Olympics    I went and saw Seb Coe. I said   London      is about truce. Ultimately  that's what it's about.  Why don't we all team up  Why don't we bring truce to life  Why don't you support the process of the largest ever global truce  We'll make a new film about this process. We'll utilize sport and football. On the Day of Peace  there's thousands of football matches all played  from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be. So  utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action. And ultimately  we have to try that. We have to work together. And when I stand here in front of all of you  and the people who will watch these things  I'm excited  on behalf of everybody I've met  that there is a possibility that our world could unite  that we could come together as one  that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues  brought about by individuals. I was with Brahimi  Ambassador Brahimi. I think he's one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics    in Afghanistan  in Iraq. He's an amazing man. And I sat with him a few weeks ago. And I said to him   Mr. Brahimi  is this nuts  going for a global truce  Is this possible  Is it really possible that we could do this   He said   It's absolutely possible.  I said   What would you do  Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system   He said   No  I'd talk to the individuals.  It's all about the individuals. It's all about you and me. It's all about partnerships. It's about your constituencies  it's about your businesses. Because together  by working together  I seriously think we can start to change things. And there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience  and I don't know where he is  who said to me a few days ago    because I did a little rehearsal    and he said   I've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with     squares  and one of them is white.  And it then made me think about a glass of water  which is clear. If you put one drop  one drop of something  in that water  it'll change it forever. By working together  we can create peace one day. Thank you TED. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you very much. Thank you. Planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling  but whose streets we can't walk. By studying those twinkling lights though  we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life. In this image of the Tokyo skyline  I've hidden data from the newest planet hunting space telescope on the block  the Kepler Mission. Can you see it  There we go. This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at  where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over         stars  all at once  every half hour  and very precisely. And what we're looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us. In just over two years of operations  we've found over       potential new planetary systems around other stars. To give you some perspective  in the previous two decades of searching  we had only known about     prior to Kepler. When we see these little dips in the light  we can determine a number of things. For one thing  we can determine that there's a planet there  but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star. That distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall. And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire  You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm  but not so close that you're too toasty and you get burned. However  there's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall. And I'll tell you why. This is our star. This is our Sun. It's shown here in visible light. That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes. You'll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball    that Sun that we all draw when we're children. But you'll notice something else  and that's that the face of the Sun has freckles. These freckles are called sunspots  and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun's magnetic field. They also cause the light from the star to vary. And we can measure this very  very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects. However  these are just the tip of the iceberg. If we had UV eyes or X ray eyes  we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun's magnetic activity    the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well. Just think  even when it's cloudy outside  these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time. So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable  whether it might be amenable to life  we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is  but we want to know about its space weather    this high energy radiation  the UV and the X rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high energy radiation. And so  we can't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system. I'm showing here Venus  Earth and Mars    three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size  but only one of which is really a good place to live. But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe. Kepler won't find a planet around every single star it looks at. But really  every measurement it makes is precious  because it's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets  and how it's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe. While it's Kepler the telescope  the instrument that stares  it's we  life  who are searching. Thank you. So the type of magic I like  and I'm a magician  is magic that uses technology to create illusions. So I would like to show you something I've been working on. It's an application that I think will be useful for artists    multimedia artists in particular. It synchronizes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices. I borrowed these three iPods from people here in the audience to show you what I mean. And I'm going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject  deception. One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain. He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes. But it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful. the creation of life. Marco Tempest  When asked about deception  he said this  Announcer  Magic is the only honest profession. A magician promises to deceive you    and he does. MT  I like to think of myself as an honest magician. I use a lot of tricks  which means that sometimes I have to lie to you. Now I feel bad about that. But people lie every day. Hold on. Phone  Hey  where are you  MT  Stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon. You've all done it. Right  I'll be ready in just a minute  darling. Center  It's just what I've always wanted. Left  You were great. MT  Deception  it's a fundamental part of life. Now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women    assuming the women they asked told the truth. We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses. The Chinese general Sun Tzu said that all war was based on deception. Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance. Some people deceive for money. Let's play a game. Three cards  three chances. Announcer  One five will get you        will get you   . Now  where's the lady  Where is the queen  MT  This one  Sorry. You lose. Well  I didn't deceive you. You deceived yourself. Self deception. That's when we convince ourselves that a lie is the truth. Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart. Compulsive gamblers are experts at self deception. They believe they can win. They forget the times they lose. The brain is very good at forgetting. Bad experiences are quickly forgotten. Bad experiences quickly disappear. Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos  we are so wonderfully optimistic. Our self deception becomes a positive illusion    why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures  why we believe Romeo when he says he loves Juliet  and why single notes of music  when played together  become a sonata and conjure up meaning. That's  Clair De lune.  Its composer  called Debussy  said that art was the greatest deception of all. Art is a deception that creates real emotions    a lie that creates a truth. And when you give yourself over to that deception  it becomes magic.  MAGIC  Thank you. Thank you very much. So  I was in the hospital for a long time. And a few years after I left  I went back  and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me    said   Dan  I have a fantastic new treatment for you.  I was very excited. I walked with him to his office. And he explained to me that  when I shave  I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is  but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair  and this creates lack of symmetry. And what's the brilliant idea he had  He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric. It sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave. Let me tell you  this was a strange way to shave  because I thought about it and I realized that the way I was shaving then would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life    because I had to keep the width the same. When I got back to his office  I wasn't really sure. I said   Can I see some evidence for this   So he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots    not very informative. I said   What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white  What would happen then    Oh  don't worry about it   he said.  We have lasers  we can whiten it out.  But I was still concerned  so I said   You know what  I'm not going to do it.  And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life. This is coming from a Jewish guy  all right  so that means a lot. And he said   Dan  what's wrong with you  Do you enjoy looking non symmetric  Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this  Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently   None of those happened. And this was very surprising to me  because I've gone through many treatments    there were many treatments I decided not to do    and I never got this guilt trip to this extent. But I decided not to have this treatment. And I went to his deputy and asked him   What was going on  Where was this guilt trip coming from   And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already  and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing. Now you probably think that this guy's a schmuck. Right  that's what he seems like. But let me give you a different perspective on the same story. A few years ago  I was running some of my own experiments in the lab. And when we run experiments  we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another. So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high  another group that I thought their performance would be very low  and when I got the results  that's what we got    I was very happy    aside from one person. There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly. And he pulled the whole mean down  destroying my statistical significance of the test. So I looked carefully at this guy. He was    some years older than anybody else in the sample. And I remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy.  Fantastic   I thought.  Let's throw him out. Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample   But a couple of days later  we thought about it with my students  and we said   What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition  What would have happened if he was in the other group  Would we have thrown him out then   We probably wouldn't have looked at the data at all  and if we did look at the data  we'd probably have said   Fantastic  What a smart guy who is performing this low   because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower  giving us even stronger statistical results than we could. So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment. But you know  these stories  and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest  basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me. The first one is that in life we encounter many people who  in some way or another  try to tattoo our faces. They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased. And I'm sure that it's something that we all recognize  and we see that it happens. Maybe we don't recognize it every time  but we understand that it happens. The most difficult thing  of course  is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives. And that's a much  much more difficult lesson to take into account. Because we don't see how conflicts of interest work on us. When I was doing these experiments  in my mind  I was helping science. I was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through. I wasn't doing something bad. In my mind  I was actually a knight trying to help science move along. But this was not the case. I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions. And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us  and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it  but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors  because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances. I do want to leave you with one positive thought. I mean  this is all very depressing  right    people have conflicts of interest  we don't see it  and so on. The positive perspective  I think  of all of this is that  if we do understand when we go wrong  if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail  we can actually hope to fix things. And that  I think  is the hope. Thank you very much. What I want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans. But before doing that  I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know  that our genomes  our genetic material  are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of DNA  which is this famous double helical molecule. And the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters A  T  C and G. And the information is there twice    one on each strand    which is important  because when new cells are formed  these strands come apart  new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process. But nothing  of course  in nature is totally perfect  so sometimes an error is made and a wrong letter is built in. And we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare DNA sequences among us here in the room  for example. If we compare my genome to the genome of you  approximately every              letters will differ between us. And these mutations accumulate approximately as a function of time. So if we add in a chimpanzee here  we will see more differences. Approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee. And if you're then interested in the history of a piece of DNA  or the whole genome  you can reconstruct the history of the DNA with those differences you observe. And generally we depict our ideas about this history in the form of trees like this. In this case  it's very simple. The two human DNA sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently. Farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees. And because these mutations happen approximately as a function of time  you can transform these differences to estimates of time  where the two humans  typically  will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago  and with the chimpanzees  it will be in the order of five million years ago. So what has now happened in the last few years is that there are account technologies around that allow you to see many  many pieces of DNA very quickly. So we can now  in a matter of hours  determine a whole human genome. Each of us  of course  contains two human genomes    one from our mothers and one from our fathers. And they are around three billion such letters long. And we will find that the two genomes in me  or one genome of mine we want to use  will have about three million differences in the order of that. And what you can then also begin to do is to say   How are these genetic differences distributed across the world   And if you do that  you find a certain amount of genetic variation in Africa. And if you look outside Africa  you actually find less genetic variation. This is surprising  of course  because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in Africa than outside Africa. Yet the people inside Africa have more genetic variation. Moreover  almost all these genetic variants we see outside Africa have closely related DNA sequences that you find inside Africa. But if you look in Africa  there is a component of the genetic variation that has no close relatives outside. So a model to explain this is that a part of the African variation  but not all of it   has  gone out and colonized the rest of the world. And together with the methods to date these genetic differences  this has led to the insight that modern humans    humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me    evolved in Africa  quite recently  between     and         years ago. And later  between     and        years ago or so  went out of Africa to colonize the rest of the world. So what I often like to say is that  from a genomic perspective  we are all Africans. We either live inside Africa today  or in quite recent exile. Another consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally distributed widely in the world  in many places  and they tend to vary as gradients  from a bird's eye perspective at least. And since there are many genetic variants  and they have different such gradients  this means that if we determine a DNA sequence    a genome from one individual    we can quite accurately estimate where that person comes from  provided that its parents or grandparents haven't moved around too much. But does this then mean  as many people tend to think  that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people    on different continents  for example  Well we can begin to ask those questions also. There is  for example  a project that's underway to sequence a thousand individuals    their genomes    from different parts of the world. They've sequenced     Africans from two populations in Africa.  They've  sequenced approximately equally  as  many people in Europe and in China. And we can begin to say how much variance do we find  how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences. And it's a lot     million variable positions. But we can then ask  Are there any absolute differences between Africans and non Africans  Perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed. And with absolute difference    and I mean a difference where people inside Africa at a certain position  where all individuals        percent    have one letter  and everybody outside Africa has another letter. And the answer to that  among those millions of differences  is that there is not a single such position. This may be surprising. Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so. So we can relax the criterion a bit and say  How many positions do we find where    percent of people in Africa have one variant     percent another variant  and the number of that is   . So this is very surprising. It means that when we look at people and see a person from Africa and a person from Europe or Asia  we cannot  for a single position in the genome with     percent accuracy  predict what the person would carry. And only for    positions can we hope to be    percent right. This may be surprising  because we can  of course  look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from. So what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see    facial features  skin color  hair structure    are not determined by single genes with big effects  but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world. There is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that I think is worthwhile to consider  and that is that  in a very literal sense  they're really on the surface of our bodies. They are what we just said    facial features  hair structure  skin color. There are also a number of features that vary between continents like that that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest  or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with microbes that try to invade our bodies. But so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment  in a direct confrontation  if you like. It's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them. But if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don't directly interact with the environment    our kidneys  our livers  our hearts    there is no way to say  by just looking at these organs  where in the world they would come from. So there's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in Africa  and that is that when those humans emerged around         years ago or so  they were not alone on the planet. There were other forms of humans around  most famously perhaps  Neanderthals    these robust forms of humans  compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right    that existed in Western Asia and Europe since several hundreds of thousands of years. So an interesting question is  what happened when we met  What happened to the Neanderthals  And to begin to answer such questions  my research group    since over    years now    works on methods to extract DNA from remains of Neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old. So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA  how you convert it to a form you can sequence. You have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with DNA from yourself. And this then  in conjunction with these methods that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly  allowed us last year to present the first version of the Neanderthal genome  so that any one of you can now look on the Internet  on the Neanderthal genome  or at least on the    percent of it that we've been able to reconstruct so far. And you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today. And one question that you may then want to ask is  what happened when we met  Did we mix or not  And the way to ask that question is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today. So we then look to do this with pairs of individuals  starting with two Africans  looking at the two African genomes  finding places where they differ from each other  and in each case ask  What is a Neanderthal like  Does it match one African or the other African  We would expect there to be no difference  because Neanderthals were never in Africa. They should be equal  have no reason to be closer to one African than another African. And that's indeed the case. Statistically speaking  there is no difference in how often the Neanderthal matches one African or the other. But this is different if we now look at the European individual and an African. Then  significantly more often  does a Neanderthal match the European rather than the African. The same is true if we look at a Chinese individual versus an African  the Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often. This may also be surprising because the Neanderthals were never in China. So the model we've proposed to explain this is that when modern humans came out of Africa sometime after         years ago  they met Neanderthals. Presumably  they did so first in the Middle East  where there were Neanderthals living. If they then mixed with each other there  then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside Africa carried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world. So that today  the people living outside Africa have about two and a half percent of their DNA from Neanderthals. So having now a Neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the DNA  we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world. And the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia in the Altai Mountains at a place called Denisova  a cave site in this mountain here  where archeologists in      found a tiny little piece of bone    this is a copy of it    that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human. And it was well enough preserved so we could determine the DNA from this individual  even to a greater extent than for the Neanderthals actually  and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome and to people today. And we found that this individual shared a common origin for his DNA sequences with Neanderthals around         years ago. And further back          years ago is there a common origin with present day humans. So this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with Neanderthals  but far back and then have a long independent history. We call this group of humans  that we then described for the first time from this tiny  tiny little piece of bone  the Denisovans  after this place where they were first described. So we can then ask for Denisovans the same things as for the Neanderthals  Did they mix with ancestors of present day people  If we ask that question  and compare the Denisovan genome to people around the world  we surprisingly find no evidence of Denisovan DNA in any people living even close to Siberia today. But we do find it in Papua New Guinea and in other islands in Melanesia and the Pacific. So this presumably means that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past  since we don't think that the ancestors of Melanesians were ever in Siberia. So from studying these genomes of extinct humans  we're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started coming out of Africa. In the West  there were Neanderthals  in the East  there were Denisovans    maybe other forms of humans too that we've not yet described. We don't know quite where the borders between these people were  but we know that in Southern Siberia  there were both Neanderthals and Denisovans at least at some time in the past. Then modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa  came out of Africa  presumably in the Middle East. They meet Neanderthals  mix with them  continue to spread over the world  and somewhere in Southeast Asia  they meet Denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the Pacific. And then these earlier forms of humans disappear  but they live on a little bit today in some of us    in that people outside of Africa have two and a half percent of their DNA from Neanderthals  and people in Melanesia actually have an additional five percent approximately from the Denisovans. Does this then mean that there is after all some absolute difference between people outside Africa and inside Africa in that people outside Africa have this old component in their genome from these extinct forms of humans  whereas Africans do not  Well I don't think that is the case. Presumably  modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa. They spread across Africa also  of course  and there were older  earlier forms of humans there. And since we mixed elsewhere  I'm pretty sure that one day  when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in Africa  we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in Africa. So to sum up  what have we learned from studying genomes of present day humans and extinct humans  We learn perhaps many things  but one thing that I find sort of important to mention is that I think the lesson is that we have always mixed. We mixed with these earlier forms of humans  wherever we met them  and we mixed with each other ever since. Thank you for your attention. I'm a filmmaker. For the last   years  I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means. When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States  one question always comes up  Where is the Palestinian Gandhi  Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance  The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers. These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region. Yet  most of you have probably never heard about them. This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful. So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention  the power of your attention  and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank  Gaza and elsewhere    but today  my case study is going to be Palestine. I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence  but for us to start paying attention to those who already are. Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus. About seven years ago  they faced extinction  because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier  and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village. They would lose    percent of their land and be surrounded  so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank. Through inspired local leadership  they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening. Let me show you some brief clips  so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground. Palestinian Woman  We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel. Here in Budrus  we realized the wall would steal our land. Israeli Man  The fence has  in fact  created a solution to terror. Man  Today you're invited to a peaceful march. You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters. Israeli Activist  Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition. Woman  We saw the men trying to push the soldiers  but none of them could do that. But I think the girls could do it. Fatah Party Member  We must empty our minds of traditional thinking. Hamas Party Member  We were in complete harmony  and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine. Chanting  One united nation. Fatah  Hamas and the Popular Front  News Anchor  The clashes over the fence continue. Reporter  Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd. They were allowed to use any force necessary. Man  These are live bullets. It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere. Israeli Activist  I was sure we were all going to die. But there were others around me who weren't even cowering. Israeli Soldier  A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the  unclear . Protester  This is a peaceful march. There is no need to use violence. Chanting  We can do it  We can do it  We can do it  Julia Bacha  When I first heard about the story of Budrus  I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago  in     . What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful. The residents  after    months of peaceful resistance  convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line  which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem. Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories. This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow  or even survive  in Palestine. Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common  they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause. If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue  it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight. The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room. The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit. The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior  since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it. Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children. But that's true for adults too. In fact  the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced  depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention. I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today. In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank  in Gaza and in East Jerusalem  I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation. In a village called Wallajeh  which sits very close to Jerusalem  the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus. They were going to be surrounded  lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access  either to the West Bank or Jerusalem. They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention. So we organized a screening. A week later  they held the most well attended and disciplined demonstration to date. The organizers say that the villagers  upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film  felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing  that people cared. So they kept on going. On the Israeli side  there is a new peace movement called Solidariot  which means solidarity in Hebrew. The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools. They report that Israelis who had never been active before  upon seeing the film  understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities. The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior. Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in  Ni'lin  Wallajeh  in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan    the nonviolent leaders would become more visible  valued and effective in their work. I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts  they are invisible  and it's as if they never happened. But I have seen first hand that if we do  they will multiply. If they multiply  their influence will grow in the overall Israeli Palestinian conflict. And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation. These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus. Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere. Thank you.
