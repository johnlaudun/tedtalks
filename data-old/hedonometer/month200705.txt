Sergey Brin  I want to discuss a question I know that's been pressing on many of your minds. We spoke to you last several years ago. And before I get started today  since many of you are wondering  I just wanted to get it out of the way. The answer is boxers. Now I hope all of you feel better. Do you know what this might be  Does anyone know what that is  Audience  Yes. SB  What is it  Audience  It's people logging on to Google around the world. SB  Wow  OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it. But this is what helped me see it. This is what we run at the office  that actually runs real time. Here it's slightly logged. But here you can see around the world how people are using Google. And every one of those rising dots represents probably about        searches  or something like that. And they're labeled by color right now  by language. So you can see  here we are in the U.S.  and they're all coming up red. There we are in Monterey    hopefully I can get it right. You can see that Japan is busy at night  right there. We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese. There's a lot of activity in China. There's a lot of activity in India. There's some in the Middle East  the little pockets. And Europe  which is right now in the middle of the day  is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages. Now you can also see  if I turn this around here    hopefully I won't shake the world too much. But you can also see  there are places where there's not so much. Australia  because there just aren't very many people there. And this is something that we should really work on  which is Africa  which is just a few trickles  basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities. But basically  what we've noticed is these queries  which come in at thousands per second  are available everywhere there is power. And pretty much everywhere there is power  there is the Internet. And even in Antarctica    well  at least this time of year    we from time to time will see a query rising up. And if we had it plotted correctly  I think the International Space Station would have it  too. So this is some of the challenge that we have here  is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the    there we go. This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. You can see that there's a lot of data running around. It has to go all over the world  through fibers  through satellites  through all kinds of connections. And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good. But you can see also  once again    so some places are much more wired than others  and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.  going up over to Asia  Europe in the other direction  and so forth. Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. And if we can switch to slides    all right  here we go. So this is slowed down. This is what one second looks like. And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing  is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load. Now  each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own. I mean  it could be somebody's health  it could be somebody's career  something important to them. And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce  or in this case  ketchup. So this is a query that we had    I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others. You can see that it got started right here. In the U.S. and Spain  it was popular at the same time. But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S. as it did in Spain. And then from Spain  it went to Italy  and then Germany got excited  and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it. And so I guess the U.S. finally  finally started to like it  too. And I just wanted to play it for you. Anyway  you can all enjoy it for yourselves    hopefully that search will work. As a part of    you know  part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches. And what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated. More animals  if they start doing searches as well. But partly  we want to make the world a better place  and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation  and we're in the process of setting that up. We also have a program already called Google Grants that now serves over     different charities around the world  and these are some of the charities that are on there. And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of. In fact  many of the organizations that are here    the Acumen Fund  I think ApproTEC we have running  I'm not sure if that one's up yet    and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. They run Google ads  and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know. One of the earlier results that we got    we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of    Vietnamese girls for their education  and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said  now there have been many  many stories that have come in  because we do have hundreds of charities in there  and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor. Now does anybody know who this is  A ha  Audience  Orkut. SB  Yes  Somebody got it. This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut  Do we have any  Okay  not very many people know about it. I'll explain it in a second. This is one of our engineers. We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves. That's how we churn those products out. Orkut had a vision to create a social network. I know all of you are thinking   Yet another social network.  But it was a dream of his  and we  basically  when people really want to do something  well  we generally let them. So this is what he built. We just released it in a test phase last month  and it's been taking off. This is our VP of Engineering. You can see the red hair  and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there. And these are all of his friends. So this is how    we just deployed it    we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service  and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. And now we've grown to over         members. And they spread  actually  very quickly  even outside the U.S. You can see  even though the U.S. is still the majority here    though  by the way  search wise  it's only about    percent of our traffic    but it's already going to Japan  and the U.K.  and Europe  and all the rest of the countries. So it's a fun little project. There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. And    well  I'll leave you in suspense. Larry  you can explain this one. Larry Page  Thank you  Sergey. So one of the things    both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school  and I think  for some reason  this has been incorporated in Google. And Sergey mentioned Orkut  which is something that  you know  Orkut wanted to do in his time  and we call this    at Google  we've embodied this as  the    percent time   and the idea is  for    percent of your time  if you're working at Google  you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And many  many things at Google have come out of that  such as Orkut and also Google News. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. Mendel  who was supposed to be teaching high school students  actually  you know  discovered the laws of genetics    as a hobby  basically. So many  many useful things come out of this. And News  which I just mentioned  was started by a researcher. And he just    he    after       he got really interested in the news. And he said   Why don't I look at the news better   And so he started clustering it by category  and then he started using it  and then his friends started using it. And then  besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom  we made it a Googlette  which is basically a small project at Google. So it'd be like three people  or something like that  and they would try to make a product. And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not. And in News' case  you know  they had a couple of people working on it for a while  and then more and more people started using it  and then we put it out on the Internet  and more and more people started using it. And now it's a real  full blown project with more people on it. And this is how we keep our innovation running. I think usually  as companies get bigger  they find it really hard to have small  innovative projects. And we had this problem  too  for a while  and we said   Oh  we really need a new concept.  You know  the Googlettes    that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not  but we hope it will  and if we do enough of them  some of them will really work and turn out  such as News. But then we had a problem because then we had over     projects. And I don't know about all of you  but I have trouble keeping     things in my head at once. And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them    and these are kind of made up. Don't really pay attention to them. For example  the  Buy Iceland  was from a media article. We would never do such a crazy thing  but    in any case  we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them  that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be. And this was kind of a surprise to me  but we found that as long as you keep the     things in your head  which you did by writing them down  that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources. And so that's basically what we've done since we instituted that a few years ago  and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well organized. The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important  and so naturally  people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities. I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new  or you might not know about. And the top thing  actually  is the Deskbar. So this is a new    how many of you use the Google Toolbar  Raise your hands. How many of you use the Deskbar  All right  see  You guys should try it out. But if you go to our site and search for  Deskbar   you'll get this. And the idea is  instead of a toolbar  it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom  and you can do searches really easily. And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar. Thank you  Sergey. This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about  and they just  they got going  and it's really  really a great product  and really taking off. Google Answers is something we started  which is really cool  which lets you    for five to     dollars  you can type a question in  and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you  and it's guaranteed and all that  and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself. Froogle lets you search shopping information  and Blogger lets you publish things. But all of these    well  these were all sort of innovative things that we did that    you know  we try many  many different things in our company. We also like to innovate in our physical space  and we noticed in meetings  you know  you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off  and they're noisy  so people shut them off. And we didn't like that  so we actually  in maybe a couple of weeks  we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors  and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. And as a result  we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting  so when you walk into a meeting room now  it lists all the meetings that are happening  you can very easily take notes  and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. And as we become more of a global company  we find these things really affect us    you know  can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room  And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference. We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings  and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines  for our younger employees especially  and ... we also allow dogs and things like that  and we've had  I think  a really fun culture at our company  which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing. This is actually our  cult picture.  I just wanted to show quickly. We had this on our website for a while  but we found that after we put it on our website  we didn't get any job applications anymore. But anyway  every year we've taken the whole company on a ski trip. A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other  and informally. And I think we've done a good job encouraging that. It makes it a really fun place to work. Along with our logos  too  which I think really embody our culture when we change things. In the early days  we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand  you know  because  you know  you'd never want to change your logo. You want it to be consistent. And we said   Well  that doesn't sound so much fun. Why don't we try changing it every day   One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now is we have this thing called AdSense  and this is a little bit foreshadowing    this is from before Dean dropped out. But the idea is  like  on a newspaper  for example  we show you relevant ads. And this is hard to read  but this says  Battle for New Hampshire  Howard Dean for President     articles on Howard Dean. And these ads are generated automatically    like in this case  on the Washington Post    from the content on the site. And so we use our over         advertisers and millions of advertisements  so we pick the one that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at  much as we do on search. So the idea is we can make advertising useful  not just annoying  right  And the nice thing about this  we have a self serve program  and many thousands of websites have signed up  and this let's them really make money. And I    you know  there's a number of people I met    I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party  and he said   You know  I wasn't making any money. I just put this thing on my site and I'm making        dollars a month. And  you know  thank you. I don't have to do my other job now.  And I think this is really important for us  because it makes the Internet work better. It makes content get better  it makes searching work better  when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content. So this session is supposed to be about the future  so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it. And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search  you really have to be smart. Because you can type  you know  any kind of thing into Google  and you expect an answer back  right  But finding things is tricky  and so you really want intelligence. And in fact  the ultimate search engine would be smart. It would be artificial intelligence. And so that's something we work on  and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now  and that's really their goal. So we always hope that Google will be smart  but we're always surprised when other people think that it is. And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this. This is a blog from Iraq  and it's not really what I'm going to talk about  but I just wanted to show you an example. Maybe  Sergey  you can highlight this. So we decided    actually  the highlight's right there. Oh  thank you. So   related searches   right there. You can't see it that well  but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads  called  related searches.  And so we'd say  you know   Did you mean 'search for'     what is this  in this case   Saddam Hussein   because this blog is about Iraq    and you know  in addition to the ads  and we thought this would be a great idea. And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed  and he said   You know  I'm sleeping a lot.  He was just kind of writing about his life. And our algorithms    not a person  of course  but our algorithms  our computers    read his blog and decided that the related search was   I am bored.  And he read this  and he thought a person had decided that he was boring  and it was very unfortunate  and he said   You know  what are these  you know  bastards at Google doing  Why don't they like my blog   And so then we read his blog  which was getting    you know  sort of going from bad to worse  and we said the related search was   Retards.  And then  you know  he got even more mad  and he wrote    like  started swearing and so on. And then we produced  You suck.  And finally  it ended with  Kiss my ass.  And so basically  he thought he was dealing with something smart  and of course  you know  we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out  and it didn't quite work  and we don't have this feature anymore. So with that  maybe I can switch back to the world. I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google  and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising  and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about  you know  places that don't have as much money. So we don't have to worry about our products being sold  for example  for less money in places that are poor  and then they get re imported into the U.S.    for example  with the drug industry. And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search  and I think that's a tremendous  tremendous benefit. The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information  and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine    that we should provide very objective information. And so in our search results  we never accept payment for our search results. We accept payment for advertising  and we mark it as such. And that's unlike many of our competitors. And I think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world  and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google. So thank you. The immersive ugliness of our everyday environments in America is entropy made visible. We can't overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this. And mostly  I want to persuade you that we have to do better if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America. By the way  this doesn't help. Nobody's having a better day down here because of that. There are a lot of ways you can describe this. You know  I like to call it  the national automobile slum.  You can call it suburban sprawl. I think it's appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck. And it's a tremendous problem for us. The outstanding    the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about. We're going to talk about that some more. A sense of place  your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings  and to employ the vocabularies  grammars  syntaxes  rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are. The public realm in America has two roles  it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life  and it is the physical manifestation of the common good. And when you degrade the public realm  you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there. The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we don't have the       year old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures. And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design. This is a body of knowledge  method  skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after World War II and decided we don't need that anymore  we're not going to use it. And consequently  we can see the result all around us. The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically  but it has to inform us where we are in our culture. Where we've come from  what kind of people we are  and it needs to  by doing that  it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present. And if there is one tremendous    if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built  the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last    years  it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present. The environments we are living in  more typically  are like these. You know  this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town. And remember  to create a place of character and quality  you have to be able to define space. So how is that being accomplished here  If you stand on the apron of the Wal Mart over here and try to look at the Target store over here  you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth.  Laughter  That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space. Consequently  these will be places that nobody wants to be in. These will be places that are not worth caring about. We have about  you know         places that are not worth caring about in the United States today. When we have enough of them  we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending. And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq  spilling their blood in the sand  and ask yourself   What is their last thought of home   I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for.  Applause  We need better places in this country. Public space. This is a good public space. It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined. It is emphatically an outdoor public room. It has something that is terribly important    it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge. That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops  bars  bistros  destinations    things go in and out of it. It's permeable. The beer goes in and out  the waitresses go in and out  and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in. You know  in these places in other cultures  people just go there voluntarily because they like them. We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here.  Laughter  You know  you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival. People just go because it's pleasurable to be there. But this is how we do it in the United States. Probably the most significant public space failure in America  designed by the leading architects of the day  Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei  Boston City Hall Plaza. A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there.  Laughter  And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive  and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it. And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings. This is the other side of the building. This was the winner of an international design award in  I think        something like that. It wasn't Pei and Cobb  another firm designed this  but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block. This is the back of Boston City Hall  the most important  you know  significant civic building in Albany    excuse me    in Boston. And what is the message that is coming  what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming  from this building and how is it informing us about who we are  This  in fact  would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin  Pol Pot  Saddam Hussein  and all the other great despots of the   th century on the side of the building  because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us. You know  that it's a despotic building  it wants us to feel like termites.  Laughter  This is it on a smaller scale  the back of the civic center in my town  Saratoga Springs  New York. By the way  when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town  they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken   Laughter  and they shouted at me and said   It was raining that day when you took that picture   Because this was perceived to be a weather problem.  Laughter  You know  this is a building designed like a DVD player.  Laughter  Audio jack  power supply    and look  you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms  right  You know  we hire firms to design these things. You can see exactly what went on  three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting. You know  eight hours before deadline  four architects trying to get this building in on time  right  And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings  and the renderings  and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table  and    I mean  what was the conversation that was going on there   Laughter  Because you know what the last word was  what the last sentence was of that meeting. It was   Fuck it.   Laughter   Applause  That    that is the message of this form of architecture. The message is  We don't give a fuck  We don't give a fuck. So I went back on the nicest day of the year  just to    you know    do some reality testing  and in fact  he will not even go down there because  Laughter  it's not interesting enough for his clients  you know  the burglars  the muggers. It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there. OK. The pattern of Main Street USA    in fact  this pattern of building downtown blocks  all over the world  is fairly universal. It's not that complicated  buildings more than one story high  built out to the sidewalk edge  so that people who are  you know  all kinds of people can get into the building. Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs  you know  apartments  offices  and so on. You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor. They haven't learned that in Monterey. If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center  you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner. It's really incredible. Anyway  this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building  and this is what happened when in Glens Falls  New York  when we tried to do it again  where it was missing  right  So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty. OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk  where the theoretical pedestrians are.  Laughter  Of course  they'll never be there  as long as this is in that condition. Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed  we pop a handicapped ramp on that  and then to make ourselves feel better  we put a nature Band Aid in front of it. And that's how we do it. I call them  nature Band Aids  because there's a general idea in America that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature. And in fact  the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism  good buildings. Not just flower beds  not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. You know  that's not good enough. We have to do good buildings. The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it  To spatially denote the pedestrian realm  to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway  to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk  and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling    a vaulted ceiling    over the street  at its best. And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees. They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods  they're not supposed to be a set for  The Last of the Mohicans.  You know  one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town  between the urban and the rural. They're not the same thing. And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city  which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time. Here you see it on a small scale    the mothership has landed  R  D  and C  PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet.  Laughter  A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city  city life  and everything connected with it. And so what you see fairly early  in the mid   th century  is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city  which is going to be life in the country for everybody. And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb  the country villa along the railroad line  which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city  but to return to the countryside every night. And believe me  there were no Wal Marts or convenience stores out there then  so it really was a form of country living. But what happens is  of course  it mutates over the next    years and it turns into something rather insidious. It becomes a cartoon of a country house  in a cartoon of the country. And that's the great non articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule. Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now. And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there  you know. Basically  a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state  emphatically   I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me. I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see.  So you have this one last facade of the house  the front  which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house. Because    notice the porch here. Unless the people that live here are Munchkins  nobody's going to be using that. This is really  in fact  a television broadcasting a show      called  We're Normal.  We're normal  we're normal  we're normal  we're normal  we're normal. Please respect us  we're normal  we're normal  we're normal. But we know what's going on in these houses  you know. We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here  getting ready for homeroom.  Laughter  We know that Heather  his sister Heather     years old  is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit. Because these places  these habitats  are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children  and they don't have a lot of experience with medication. So they take the first one that comes along  often. These are not good enough for Americans. These are the schools we are sending them to  The Hannibal Lecter Central School  Las Vegas  Nevada. This is a real school  You know  but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out  that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver. So every effort is made to keep them within the building. Notice that nature is present.  Laughter  We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not. We are entering an epochal period of change in the world  and    certainly in America    the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era. It is going to change absolutely everything. Chris asked me not to go on too long about this  and I won't  except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy. Forget it. It's not going to happen. We're going to have to do something else instead. We're going to have to down scale  re scale  and re size virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it. We're going to have     Applause     we're going to have to live closer to where we work. We're going to have to live closer to each other. We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live. The age of the       mile Caesar salad is coming to an end. We're going to have to    we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of  We gotta do better than that  And we should have started two days before yesterday. We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there  for the last    years  excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents' generation after World War II. Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns. We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to re learn how to compose meaningful places  places that are integral  that allow    that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life and our communal life  deployed in an integral fashion. So that  you know  the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business  of culture and of governance. We're going to have to re learn what the building blocks of these things are  the street  the block  how to compose public space that's both large and small  the courtyard  the civic square and how to really make use of this property. We can see some of the first ideas for retro fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America. The dead malls  what are we going to do with them  Well  in point of fact  most of them are not going to make it. They're not going to be retro fitted  they're going to be the salvage yards of the future. Some of them we're going to fix  though. And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development. And if we're lucky  the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities. And by the way  our towns and cities are where they are  and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites. And most of them are still going to be there  although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished. We've got a lot of work to do. We're not going to be rescued by the hyper car  we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels. No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running  the way we're running it. We're going to have to do everything very differently. And America's not prepared. We are sleepwalking into the future. We're not ready for what's coming at us. So I urge you all to do what you can. Life in the mid   st century is going to be about living locally. Be prepared to be good neighbors. Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens. One final thing    I've been very disturbed about this for years  but I think it's particularly important for this audience. Please  please  stop referring to yourselves as  consumers.  OK  Consumers are different than citizens. Consumers do not have obligations  responsibilities and duties to their fellow human beings. And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion  you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having. And we're going to continue being clueless going into this very difficult future that we face. So thank you very much. Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending.  Applause  There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world and at IDEO this past year  and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you. I didn't attend the first TED back in      but I've been to a lot of them since that time. I thought it  would  kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much  Richard  it's been a big  enjoyable part of my life  coming here. And so thinking back  I was thinking those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects    certainly technological objects. And so it was great fun in those days  and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients. We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we'd put it on the conference table  and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would  ooh  and  ah.  That was a really good time. And so we'll continue to focus on products  as we always have. And if you were here last year  I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule    which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring. And I took a lot of pictures last year  very few people knew what I was up to  but I took a lot of pictures. This year    maybe you could show the slides    this year we're carrying this Treo  which we had a lot to do with and helped Handspring design it. Also  though we designed it a few years ago    it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so    this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives. Maybe you've seen them in the airports  They seem to be everywhere now. Lots of lives are being saved by those. And  we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read. So  we really will continue to focus on products. But something's happened in the last    years since Richard started TED  and that's that people like us    I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time  but for us  we've really just started ... we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit    and so we're now focused more and more on human centered design  human centeredness in an approach to design. That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products. And I think you're starting to see that  and it's making our job even more enjoyable. Interestingly enough  we used to primarily build   D models    you know  you've seen some today    and   D renderings. Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas. But firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion  showing how they'll be used. And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man machine relationship. And it's a much better way to see. It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses  as opposed to them being empty. So I thought that I would show you a few videos to show off this new  broader definition of design in products and services and environments. I have a few of them    they're no more than a minute or a minute and a half apiece    but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year  and how it responds in video. So  Prada New York  we were asked by Rem Koolhaas and OMA to help us conceive the technology that's in their retail store in New York. He wanted a new kind of store    a new one    a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one. And that meant actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use. So  there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags  there's RF tags on the user  on the cards  there's the staff devices that are all around the store. You pick them up  and once you see something that you're interested in  the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store. You can look at color  and sizes  and how it appeared on the runway  or whatever. And so then the object    the merchandise that you're interested in    can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room  and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room. We can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that  and get more information about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on. It's been used a lot of places  but I particularly like the use here of liquid crystal displays in the changing room. The last time I went to see this store  there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering   Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here   But if you push the button  of course  the whole wall goes dark. So you can try to get approval  or not  for whatever you're wearing. And then one of my favorite features of the technology is the magic mirror  where you put on the clothes. There's a big display in the mirror  and you can turn around    but there's a three second delay. So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around  as you look. About a year and a half ago we were asked to design an installation in the museum    this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London  and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues. And a group at Itch  which is now part of IDEO  designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall. I don't know if anybody's seen this    it's pretty spectacular in the room. Anyway  it's based on the London subway system. And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving  and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see. So you enter your information. Then  like the London tube system  the little trains go around with what you're thinking about. And then when you get to a station  it's expanded so that you can actually read it. Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor    mostly teenagers coming out of there    there's this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun  also designed by Durrell  Bishop  and Andrew  Hirniak  of Itch. And the topics include things that the museum is about  male fertility  choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like. There's lots of room  so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved. And also  it's not shown in the video  but these are very beautiful. They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top  after they've bounced around  they disperse into bits and go off into the atmosphere. The next video is not done by us. This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago. Scott Adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn't help to design the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert  which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up. He's always been interested in technology in the future. the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles. So we thought  well  wouldn't it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better  Narrator  Though they work in a wide open office space spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge  the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems. Woman  A one way mirror. I can look out  you can look at yourself. Narrator  They took pictures. Woman  You feel so trapped  when someone kind of leans over and you're sort of held captive there for a minute. SA  So far it's chaos  but a lot of people are doing stuff  so that's good. We'll see what happens. Narrator  The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens for the computer and for family photos. In the second group's scenario  the walls are alive and actually give Dilbert a group hug. Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.  David Kelley  So here's the final thing  complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across    that follows the tracks of the sun    across the sky. So you feel that in your cubicle. And my favorite feature  which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment  and then when you come back  it comes up to greet you  happy to see you. DK  You know  it has homey touches like a built in fish tank in the walls  or something to be aggressive with to release tension. DK  And of course  a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle. DK  This next project  we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London. The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it  as well as wastewater. So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time. The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful. In contrast to if you went inside the dome  where it's kind of wild and crazy and everybody's learning all kinds of things  or fooling around  or whatever they're doing. But it was intended to be quite quiet. And then you would wander around and gather information  in a straightforward fashion  about the recycling process and what's being done  and how they're going to reuse the water once it comes through the plant. And then  if you saw  the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information on the front side  but as they rotate  you can see the actual recycling plant behind  with all the machines as they actually process the water. You can see  there's the plant. These are all very low budget videos  like quick prototypes. And we're announcing a new product here tonight  which is the first time this has ever been shown in public. It's called Spyfish  and it's a company called H Eye  started by Nigel Jagger in London. And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience    many people have boats  or enjoy being on boats  but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what's there  and enjoying what scuba divers do. This product  it has two cameras. You throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet. For us    there's the object    for us  it was two projects. One  to design the interface so that the interface doesn't get in your way. You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater    of feeling like you're underwater    seeing what's going on. And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool. And so we spent a lot of time    this has been going on for about seven or eight years  this project    and  we're  just ready to start building them. It can dive to     feet  to where sunlight does not penetrate  and is equipped with powerful lights. It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep. The battery powered Spyfish sends the live video feed through a slender cable.  DK  This slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is. Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control. You watch the video with superimposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading. The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater.  DK  And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC  which is a project that I'm very excited about. ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher  who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford. He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright and he had a very interesting insight  which is that he said   There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya  there must be entrepreneurs everywhere.  And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there they could find enough money to put something together. So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya with Kenyan manufacturers    designed by people like us  but taken there. And to this date    he's been gone for only a few years    he's started        companies. He's made        new jobs. And just the sales of the products    this is a non profit    the sales of these products is now .   of the GDP of Kenya. This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing. So we're in the process of helping them design deep well  low cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off season. What they do now is  they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can't grow them in the off season. And so by doing that  the woman that you saw in the first thing    she's a school teacher    always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things. So with seed squeezers  and pumps  and hay balers and very straightforward things that we're designing    my students are doing this as class projects and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work    it's really amazing to see his success  Martin's. We also were thinking about the experience of Richard  and so       we designed this hat  because I knew I'd be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say. Can you read it  Well  it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers. You know  you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty  and so I thought this would do it  where I just sit here. So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session  and from all the different presenters. And in my own practice  from product to ApproTEC  it's really exciting that we're taking a more human centered approach to design  that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do  and I think this is great. Designers are more trusted and more integrated into the business strategy of companies  and I have to say  for one  I feel very lucky at the progress that design has made since the first TED. Thanks a lot. I do two things  I design mobile computers and I study brains. And today's talk is about brains and  yay  somewhere I have a brain fan out there. I'm going to  if I can have my first slide up here  and you'll see the title of my talk and my two affiliations. So what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory  why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it. And I'll try to do all that in    minutes. I have two affiliations. Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days  but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park  and we study theoretical neuroscience  and we study how the neocortex works. I'm going to talk all about that. I have one slide on my other life  the computer life  and that's the slide here. These are some of the products I've worked on over the last    years  starting back from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on  and ending up most recently with the Treo  and we're continuing to do this. And I've done this because I really believe that mobile computing is the future of personal computing  and I'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things. But this was  I have to admit  all an accident. I really didn't want to do any of these products and very early in my career I decided I was not going to be in the computer industry. And before I tell you about that  I just have to tell you this one little picture of graffiti there I picked off the web the other day. I was looking for a picture of graffiti  little text input language  and I found the website dedicated to teachers who want to make these  you know  the script writing things across the top of their blackboard  and they had added graffiti to it  and I'm sorry about that. So what happened was  when I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in '    I decided    I went to work for Intel and I was in the computer industry    and three months into that  I fell in love with something else  and I said   I made the wrong career choice here   and I fell in love with brains. This is not a real brain. This is a picture of one  a line drawing. But I don't remember exactly how it happened  but I have one recollection  which was pretty strong in my mind. In September       Scientific American came out with a single topic issue about the brain. And it was quite good. It was one of the best issues ever. And they talked about the neuron and development and disease and vision and all the things you might want to know about brains. It was really quite impressive. And one might have the impression that we really knew a lot about brains. But the last article in that issue was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame. Today is  I think  the   th anniversary of the discovery of DNA. And he wrote a story basically saying  well  this is all well and good  but you know what  we don't know diddley squat about brains and no one has a clue how these things work  so don't believe what anyone tells you. This is a quote from that article. He said   What is conspicuously lacking   he's a very proper British gentleman so   What is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches.  I thought the word framework was great. He didn't say we didn't even have a theory. He says  we don't even know how to begin to think about it    we don't even have a framework. We are in the pre paradigm days  if you want to use Thomas Kuhn. And so I fell in love with this  and said look  we have all this knowledge about brains. How hard can it be  And this is something we can work on my lifetime. I felt I could make a difference  and so I tried to get out of the computer business  into the brain business. First  I went to MIT  the AI lab was there  and I said  well  I want to build intelligent machines  too  but the way I want to do it is to study how brains work first. And they said  oh  you don't need to do that. We're just going to program computers  that's all we need to do. And I said  no  you really ought to study brains. They said  oh  you know  you're wrong. And I said  no  you're wrong  and I didn't get in. But I was a little disappointed    pretty young    but I went back again a few years later and this time was in California  and I went to Berkeley. And I said  I'll go in from the biological side. So I got in    in the Ph.D. program in biophysics  and I was  all right  I'm studying brains now  and I said  well  I want to study theory. And they said  oh no  you can't study theory about brains. That's not something you do. You can't get funded for that. And as a graduate student  you can't do that. So I said  oh my gosh. I was very depressed. I said  but I can make a difference in this field. So what I did is I went back in the computer industry and said  well  I'll have to work here for a while  do something. That's when I designed all those computer products. And I said  I want to do this for four years  make some money  like I was having a family  and I would mature a bit  and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit. Well  it took longer than four years. It's been about    years. But I'm doing it now  and I'm going to tell you about it. So why should we have a good brain theory  Well  there's lots of reasons people do science. One is    the most basic one is    people like to know things. We're curious  and we just go out and get knowledge  you know  Why do we study ants  Well  it's interesting. Maybe we'll learn something really useful about it  but it's interesting and fascinating. But sometimes  a science has some other attributes which makes it really  really interesting. Sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves  it'll tell us who we are. Rarely  you know  evolution did this and Copernicus did this  where we have a new understanding of who we are. And after all  we are our brains. My brain is talking to your brain. Our bodies are hanging along for the ride  but my brain is talking to your brain. And if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive  we really understand what brains are. Another thing is sometimes science leads to really big societal benefits and technologies  or businesses  or whatever  that come out of it. And this is one  too  because when we understand how brains work  we're going to be able to build intelligent machines  and I think that's actually a good thing on the whole  and it's going to have tremendous benefits to society  just like a fundamental technology. So why don't we have a good theory of brains  And people have been working on it for     years. Well  let's first take a look at what normal science looks like. This is normal science. Normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists. And so the theorist guys say  well  I think this is what's going on  and the experimentalist says  no  you're wrong. And it goes back and forth  you know  This works in physics. This works in geology. But if this is normal science  what does neuroscience look like  This is what neuroscience looks like. We have this mountain of data  which is anatomy  physiology and behavior. You can't imagine how much detail we know about brains. There were        people who went to the neuroscience conference this year  and every one of them is doing research in brains. A lot of data. But there's no theory. There's a little  wimpy box on top there. And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences. And it's a real shame. Now why has this come about  If you ask neuroscientists  why is this the state of affair  they'll first of all admit it. But if you ask them  they'll say  well  there's various reasons we don't have a good brain theory. Some people say  well  we don't still have enough data  we need to get more information  there's all these things we don't know. Well  I just told you there's so much data coming out your ears. We have so much information  we don't even know how to begin to organize it. What good is more going to do  Maybe we'll be lucky and discover some magic thing  but I don't think so. This is actually a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory. We don't need more data    we need a good theory about it. Another one is sometimes people say  well  brains are so complex  it'll take another    years. I even think Chris said something like this yesterday. I'm not sure what you said  Chris  but something like  well  it's one of the most complicated things in the universe. That's not true. You're more complicated than your brain. You've got a brain. And it's also  although the brain looks very complicated  things look complicated until you understand them. That's always been the case. And so all we can say  well  my neocortex  which is the part of the brain I'm interested in  has    billion cells. But  you know what  It's very  very regular. In fact  it looks like it's the same thing repeated over and over and over again. It's not as complex as it looks. That's not the issue. Some people say  brains can't understand brains. Very Zen like. Whoo.  Laughter  You know  it sounds good  but why  I mean  what's the point  It's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver. It's got a lot of cells in it too  right  So  you know  I don't think there's anything to that. And finally  some people say  well  you know  I don't feel like a bunch of cells  you know. I'm conscious. I've got this experience  I'm in the world  you know. I can't be just a bunch of cells. Well  you know  people used to believe there was a life force to be living  and we now know that's really not true at all. And there's really no evidence that says    well  other than people just have disbelief that cells can do what they do. And so  if some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism  some really smart people  too  but we can reject all that. No  I'm going to tell you there's something else  and it's really fundamental  and this is what it is  there's another reason why we don't have a good brain theory  and it's because we have an intuitive  strongly held  but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer. There's something we believe that just  it's obvious  but it's wrong. Now  there's a history of this in science and before I tell you what it is  I'm going to tell you a bit about the history of it in science. You look at some other scientific revolutions  and this case  I'm talking about the solar system  that's Copernicus  Darwin's evolution  and tectonic plates  that's Wegener. They all have a lot in common with brain science. First of all  they had a lot of unexplained data. A lot of it. But it got more manageable once they had a theory. The best minds were stumped    really  really smart people. We're not smarter now than they were then. It just turns out it's really hard to think of things  but once you've thought of them  it's kind of easy to understand it. My daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework by the time they were in kindergarten. And now it's not that hard  you know  here's the apple  here's the orange  you know  the Earth goes around  that kind of stuff. Finally  another thing is the answer was there all along  but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing  and that's the thing. It was an intuitive  strong held belief that was wrong. In the case of the solar system  the idea that the Earth is spinning and the surface of the Earth is going like a thousand miles an hour  and the Earth is going through the solar system about a million miles an hour. This is lunacy. We all know the Earth isn't moving. Do you feel like you're moving a thousand miles an hour  Of course not. You know  and someone who said  well  it was spinning around in space and it's so huge  they would lock you up  and that's what they did back then. So it was intuitive and obvious. Now what about evolution  Evolution's the same thing. We taught our kids  well  the Bible says  you know  God created all these species  cats are cats  dogs are dogs  people are people  plants are plants  they don't change. Noah put them on the Ark in that order  blah  blah  blah. And  you know  the fact is  if you believe in evolution  we all have a common ancestor  and we all have a common ancestry with the plant in the lobby. This is what evolution tells us. And  it's true. It's kind of unbelievable. And the same thing about tectonic plates  you know  All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the Earth  you know  It's like  it doesn't make any sense. So what is the intuitive  but incorrect assumption  that's kept us from understanding brains  Now I'm going to tell it to you  and it's going to seem obvious that that is correct  and that's the point  right  Then I'm going to have to make an argument why you're incorrect about the other assumption. The intuitive but obvious thing is that somehow intelligence is defined by behavior  that we are intelligent because of the way that we do things and the way we behave intelligently  and I'm going to tell you that's wrong. What it is is intelligence is defined by prediction. And I'm going to work you through this in a few slides here  give you an example of what this means. Here's a system. Engineers like to look at systems like this. Scientists like to look at systems like this. They say  well  we have a thing in a box  and we have its inputs and its outputs. The AI people said  well  the thing in the box is a programmable computer because that's equivalent to a brain  and we'll feed it some inputs and we'll get it to do something  have some behavior. And Alan Turing defined the Turing test  which is essentially saying  we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human. A behavioral metric of what intelligence is  and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time. Reality though  I call it real intelligence. Real intelligence is built on something else. We experience the world through a sequence of patterns  and we store them  and we recall them. And when we recall them  we match them up against reality  and we're making predictions all the time. It's an eternal metric. There's an eternal metric about us sort of saying  do we understand the world  Am I making predictions  And so on. You're all being intelligent right now  but you're not doing anything. Maybe you're scratching yourself  or picking your nose  I don't know  but you're not doing anything right now  but you're being intelligent  you're understanding what I'm saying. Because you're intelligent and you speak English  you know what word is at the end of this     Silence  sentence. The word came into you  and you're making these predictions all the time. And then  what I'm saying is  is that the eternal prediction is the output in the neocortex. And that somehow  prediction leads to intelligent behavior. And here's how that happens. Let's start with a non intelligent brain. Well I'll argue a non intelligent brain  we got hold of an old brain  and we're going to say it's like a non mammal  like a reptile  so I'll say  an alligator  we have an alligator. And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses. It's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on  a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior. It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you  you know. It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff. But we don't consider the alligator very intelligent  not like in a human sort of way. But it has all this complex behavior already. Now  in evolution  what happened  First thing that happened in evolution with mammals  we started to develop a thing called the neocortex. And I'm going to represent the neocortex here  by this box that's sticking on top of the old brain. Neocortex means new layer. It is a new layer on top of your brain. If you don't know it  it's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that  it's got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit. No  really  that's what it is. It's about the size of a table napkin. And it doesn't fit  so it gets all wrinkly. Now look at how I've drawn this here. The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain. You do. It's your emotional brain. It's all those things  and all those gut reactions you have. And on top of it  we have this memory system called the neocortex. And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain. And so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain  it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing. It's sitting there saying  ah  I'm going to memorize all the things that are going on  where I've been  people I've seen  things I've heard  and so on. And in the future  when it sees something similar to that again  so in a similar environment  or the exact same environment  it'll play it back. It'll start playing it back. Oh  I've been here before. And when you've been here before  this happened next. It allows you to predict the future. It allows you to  literally it feeds back the signals into your brain  they'll let you see what's going to happen next  will let you hear the word  sentence  before I said it. And it's this feeding back into the old brain that'll allow you to make very more intelligent decisions. This is the most important slide of my talk  so I'll dwell on it a little bit. And so  all the time you say  oh  I can predict the things. And if you're a rat and you go through a maze  and then you learn the maze  the next time you're in a maze  you have the same behavior  but all of a sudden  you're smarter because you say  oh  I recognize this maze  I know which way to go  I've been here before  I can envision the future. And that's what it's doing. In humans    by the way  this is true for all mammals  it's true for other mammals    and in humans  it got a lot worse. In humans  we actually developed the front part of the neocortex called the anterior part of the neocortex. And nature did a little trick. It copied the posterior part  the back part  which is sensory  and put it in the front part. And humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front  but we use it for motor control. So we are now able to make very sophisticated motor planning  things like that. I don't have time to get into all this  but if you want to understand how a brain works  you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works  how it is we store patterns and make predictions. So let me give you a few examples of predictions. I already said the word  sentence.  In music  if you've heard a song before  if you heard Jill sing those songs before  when she sings them  the next note pops into your head already    you anticipate it as you're going. If it was an album of music  the end of one album  the next song pops into your head. And these things happen all the time. You're making these predictions. I have this thing called the altered door thought experiment. And the altered door thought experiment says  you have a door at home  and when you're here  I'm changing it  I've got a guy back at your house right now  moving the door around  and they're going to take your doorknob and move it over two inches. And when you go home tonight  you're going to put your hand out there  and you're going to reach for the doorknob and you're going to notice it's in the wrong spot  and you'll go  whoa  something happened. It may take a second to figure out what it was  but something happened. Now I could change your doorknob in other ways. I can make it larger or smaller  I can change its brass to silver  I could make it a lever. I can change your door  put colors on  I can put windows in. I can change a thousand things about your door  and in the two seconds you take to open your door  you're going to notice that something has changed. Now  the engineering approach to this  the AI approach to this  is to build a door database. It has all the door attributes. And as you go up to the door  you know  let's check them off one at time. Door  door  door  you know  color  you know what I'm saying. We don't do that. Your brain doesn't do that. What your brain is doing is making constant predictions all the time about what is going to happen in your environment. As I put my hand on this table  I expect to feel it stop. When I walk  every step  if I missed it by an eighth of an inch  I'll know something has changed. You're constantly making predictions about your environment. I'll talk about vision here briefly. This is a picture of a woman. And when you look at people  your eyes are caught over at two to three times a second. You're not aware of this  but your eyes are always moving. And so when you look at someone's face  you'd typically go from eye to eye to eye to nose to mouth. Now  when your eye moves from eye to eye  if there was something else there like  a nose  you'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be  and you'd go  oh shit  you know    There's something wrong about this person. And that's because you're making a prediction. It's not like you just look over there and say  what am I seeing now  A nose  that's okay. No  you have an expectation of what you're going to see. Every single moment. And finally  let's think about how we test intelligence. We test it by prediction. What is the next word in this  you know  This is to this as this is to this. What is the next number in this sentence  Here's three visions of an object. What's the fourth one  That's how we test it. It's all about prediction. So what is the recipe for brain theory  First of all  we have to have the right framework. And the framework is a memory framework  not a computation or behavior framework. It's a memory framework. How do you store and recall these sequences or patterns  It's spatio temporal patterns. Then  if in that framework  you take a bunch of theoreticians. Now biologists generally are not good theoreticians. It's not always true  but in general  there's not a good history of theory in biology. So I found the best people to work with are physicists  engineers and mathematicians  who tend to think algorithmically. Then they have to learn the anatomy  and they've got to learn the physiology. You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms. Anyone who gets up and tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn't tell you exactly how it's working in the brain and how the wiring works in the brain  it is not a theory. And that's what we're doing at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute. I would love to have more time to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing  and I expect to be back up on this stage  maybe this will be some other time in the not too distant future and tell you about it. I'm really  really excited. This is not going to take    years at all. So what will brain theory look like  First of all  it's going to be a theory about memory. Not like computer memory. It's not at all like computer memory. It's very  very different. And it's a memory of these very high dimensional patterns  like the things that come from your eyes. It's also memory of sequences. You cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence. A song must be heard in sequence over time  and you must play it back in sequence over time. And these sequences are auto associatively recalled  so if I see something  I hear something  it reminds me of it  and then it plays back automatically. It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output. And as I said  the theory must be biologically accurate  it must be testable  and you must be able to build it. If you don't build it  you don't understand it. So  one more slide here. What is this going to result in  Are we going to really build intelligent machines  Absolutely. And it's going to be different than people think. No doubt that it's going to happen  in my mind. First of all  it's going to be built up  we're going to build the stuff out of silicon. The same techniques we use for building silicon computer memories  we can use for here. But they're very different types of memories. And we're going to attach these memories to sensors  and the sensors will experience real live  real world data  and these things are going to learn about their environment. Now it's very unlikely the first things you're going to see are like robots. Not that robots aren't useful and people can build robots. But the robotics part is the hardest part. That's the old brain. That's really hard. The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain. So the first thing we're going to do are the things that don't require a lot of robotics. So you're not going to see C  PO. You're going to more see things like  you know  intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is and what driving is and have learned that certain types of cars with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren't going to turn  things like that. We can also do intelligent security systems. Anywhere where we're basically using our brain  but not doing a lot of mechanics. Those are the things that are going to happen first. But ultimately  the world's the limit here. I don't know how this is going to turn out. I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor and if you talk to them  they knew what they were doing was really significant  but they didn't really know what was going to happen. They couldn't anticipate cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff. They just knew like  hey  they were going to build calculators and traffic light controllers. But it's going to be big. In the same way  this is like brain science and these memories are going to be a very fundamental technology  and it's going to lead to very unbelievable changes in the next     years. And I'm most excited about how we're going to use them in science. So I think that's all my time  I'm over it  and I'm going to end my talk right there. I'd like to start tonight by something completely different  asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.    percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean  and it's where life    the title of our seminar tonight    it's where life began. And it's a lively and a lovely place  but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our    not only with our overfishing  our irresponsible fishing  our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland  but also  most recently  with climate change  and Steve Schneider  I'm sure  will be going into greater detail on this. Now  as we continue to tinker with the oceans  more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low energy type of animals  like jellyfish and bacteria. And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for. Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful  and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday  but they sting like hell  and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up. About     grams of jellyfish equals four calories. So it may be good for the waistline  but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long. And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans  that is  unless you eat jellyfish. And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there  a by the wind sailor. And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish  the Mola mola  whose primary prey are jellyfish. This animal is in  The Guinness World Book of Records  for being the world's heaviest bony fish. It reaches up to almost       pounds    on a diet of jellyfish  primarily. And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola    its common name is sunfish    that its favorite food is the moon jelly. So it's kind of nice  the sun and the moon getting together this way  even if one is eating the other. Now this is typically how you see sunfish  this is where they get their common name. They like to sunbathe  can't blame them. They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they're sick or lazy  but that's a typical behavior  they lie out and bask on the surface. Their other name  Mola mola  is    it sounds Hawaiian  but it's actually Latin for millstone  and that's attributable to their roundish  very bizarre  cut off shape. It's as if  as they were growing  they just forgot the tail part. And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place  was this terribly bizarre shape. You know  you look at sharks  and they're streamlined  and they're sleek  and you look at tuna  and they're like torpedoes    they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength  and then you look at the sunfish. And this is just so elegantly mysterious  it's just    it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say  a tuna. So I was just intrigued with what    you know  what is this animal's story  Well  as with anything in biology  nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution. The Mola's no exception. They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared     million years ago  at a time when whales still had legs  and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction    oblige me a little Kipling esque storytelling here. Of course evolution is somewhat random  and you know  about    million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said  oh  the heck with the coral reefs    we're going to head to the high seas. And lots of generations  lots of tweaking and torquing  and we turn our puffer into the Mola. You know  if you give Mother Nature enough time  that is what she will produce. They look    maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished  abridged perhaps  but in fact  in fact they are the    they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily derived fish in the sea  right up there with flat fish. They're    every single thing about that fish has been changed. And in terms of fishes    fishes appeared     million years ago  and they're pretty modern  just    million years ago  so    so interestingly  they give away their ancestry as they develop. They start as little eggs  and they're in  The Guinness World Book of Records  again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet. A single four foot female had     million eggs  can carry     million eggs in her ovaries    imagine    and they get to be over    feet long. Imagine what a    foot one has. And from that little egg  they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage  reminiscent of their ancestry  and develop    this is their little adolescent stage. They school as adolescents  and become behemoth loners as adults. That's a little diver up there in the corner. They're in  The Guinness World Book of Records  again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world. From their little hatching size of their egg  into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood  they put on     million times an increase in weight.     million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby  and you had to feed this thing. That would mean that your child  you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics. Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but    we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild  but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium    one of the first places to have them in captivity    they had one that gained     lbs in    months. I said  now  that's a true American. So being a loner is a great thing  especially in today's seas  because schooling used to be salvation for fishes  but it's suicide for fishes now. But unfortunately Molas  even though they don't school  they still get caught in nets as by catch. If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination  then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators    how they live their lives  like the Mola. And unfortunately  they make up a large portion of the California by catch    up to    percent of the drift net. And in the Mediterranean  in the swordfish net fisheries  they make up up to    percent. So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives. And how do you do that  How do you do that with an animal    very few places in the world. This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries    it doesn't go to land. How do you get insight  How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets  Well  there's some great new technology that has just recently become available  and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals. And it's pictured right here  that little tag up there. That little tag can record temperature  depth and light intensity  which is correlated with time  and from that we can get locations. And it can record this data for up to two years  and keep it in that tag  release at a pre programmed time  float to the surface  upload all that data  that whole travelogue  to satellite  which relays it directly to our computers  and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have    we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know  sat at our desks. So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them    if you look up here    that's streaming off  that's right where we put the tag. And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola. Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites. They're just parasite hotels  even their parasites have parasites. I think Donne wrote a poem about that. But they have    genera of parasites  and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem. And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment. They don't seem to mind  so far. So what are we trying to find out  We're focusing on the Pacific. We're tagging on the California coast  and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan. And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents  using temperature  using the open ocean  to live their lives. We'd love to tag in Monterey. Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers. Not this time of year    it's more around October. And we'd love to tag here    this is an aerial shot of Monterey    but unfortunately  the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way. The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay  rips off their fins  fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee  Mola style  and then tosses them back and forth. And I'm not exaggerating  it is just    and sometimes they don't eat them  it's just spiteful. And you know  the locals think it's terrible behavior  it's just horrible watching this happen  day after day. The poor little Molas coming in  getting ripped to shreds  so we head down south  to San Diego. Not so many California sea lions down there. And the Molas there  you can find them with a spotter plane very easily  and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp. And under those kelps    this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there. As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp  the exfoliating cleaner fish come. And they come and give the Molas    you can see they strike this funny little position that says   I'm not threatening  but I need a massage.  And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head  and the fish come up and they just clean  clean  clean    because the Molas  you know  there's just a smorgasbord of parasites. And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer  and the Molas are kind of friendly down there. I mean what other kind of fish  if you approach it right  will say   Okay  scratch me right there.  You truly can swim up to a Mola    they're very gentle    and if you approach them right  you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it. So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific  we've gone over to another part of the Pacific  and we've tagged in Taiwan  and we tagged in Japan. And over in these places  the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries. And they're not thrown back as by catch  they're eaten. We were served a nine course meal of Mola after we tagged. Well  not the one we tagged  And everything from the kidney  to the testes  to the back bone  to the fin muscle to    I think that  s pretty much the whole fish    is eaten. So the hardest part of tagging  now  is after you put that tag on  you have to wait  months. And you're just wondering  oh  I hope the fish is safe  I hope  I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording. The tags cost      dollars each  and then satellite time is another     dollars  so you're like  oh  I hope the tag is okay. And so the waiting is really the hardest part. I'm going to show you our latest dataset. And it hasn't been published  so it's totally privy information just for TED. And in showing you this  you know  when we're looking at this data  we're thinking  oh do these animals  do they cross the equator  Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other  And we found that they kind of are homebodies. They're not big migrators. This is their track  we deployed the tag off of Tokyo  and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there. And after four months  went up  you know  off of the north part of Japan. And that's kind of their home range. Now that's important  though  because if there's a lot of fishing pressure  that population doesn't get replenished. So that's a very important piece of data. But also what's important is that they're not slacker  lazy fish. They're super industrious. And this is a day in the life of a Mola  and if we    they're up and down  and up and down  and up and down  and up and up and down  up to    times a day. As the sun comes up  you see in the blue  they start their dive. Down    and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper  little deeper. They plumb the depths down to     meters  in temperatures to one degree centigrade  and this is why you see them on the surface    it's so cold down there. They've got to come up  warm  get that solar power  and then plunge back into the depths  and go up and down and up and down. And they're hitting a layer down there  it's called the deep scattering layer    which a whole variety of food's in that layer. So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker  they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature. We see the same pattern    now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes  manta rays  tunas  a real three dimensional play. This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life  where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that. And what's exciting    you all travel  and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals  and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge. Well now with the Census of Marine Life  we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore    percent of our living space  with local knowledge. It's never    it's really never been a more exciting  or a vital time  to be a biologist. Which brings me to my last point  and what I think is kind of the most fun. I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish. And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered  and I'd be able to thank my funders  like National Geographic and Lindbergh. But people would write into the site with all sorts of  all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis. And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared    a shared love and an interest in the oceans. I was getting reports from Catholic nuns  Jewish Rabbis  Muslims  Christians    everybody writing in  united by their love of life. And to me that    I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself   One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.  And sure  it may be just one big old silly fish  but it's helping. If it's helping to unite the world  I think it's definitely the fish of the future. What I'm going to show you first  as quickly as I can  is some foundational work  some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon  and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. We're looking at many  many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in  panning through it  rearranging it in any way we want. And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at  how big these collections are or how big the images are. Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos  but this one  for example  is a scan from the Library of Congress  and it's in the     megapixel range. It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture. This is an entire book  so this is an example of non image data. This is  Bleak House  by Dickens. Every column is a chapter. To prove to you that it's really text  and not an image  we can do something like so  to really show that this is a real representation of the text  it's not a picture. Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e book. I wouldn't recommend it. This is a more realistic case  an issue of The Guardian. Every large image is the beginning of a section. And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper  which is an inherently multi scale kind of medium. We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution    much higher than in an ordinary ad    and we've embedded extra content. If you want to see the features of this car  you can see it here. Or other models  or even technical specifications. And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. We hope that this means no more pop ups and other rubbish like that    shouldn't be necessary. Of course  mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this. And this one I really won't spend any time on  except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. But those are all the roads in the U.S. superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. So let's pull up  now  something else. This is actually live on the Web now  you can go check it out. This is a project called Photosynth  which marries two different technologies. One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Snavely  a graduate student at the University of Washington  co advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A very nice collaboration. And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. You can see that when we do these sorts of views  where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi resolution experience. But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots    all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies    all these shots were taken. So you see elements here of stabilized slide show or panoramic imaging  and these things have all been related spatially. I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. Some are much more spatial. I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data sets    this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer    to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology  It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website. We had to worry about the lawyers and so on. This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. You just type Notre Dame into Flickr  and you get some pictures of guys in T shirts  and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. And so these are all Flickr images  and they've all been related spatially in this way. We can just navigate in this very simple way. You know  I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here. I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras  it's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRs  quite a large number of them  stitched together in this environment. If I can find some of the sort of weird ones    So many of them are occluded by faces  and so on. Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs    here we go. This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment. What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody    from the entire collective memory  visually  of what the Earth looks like    and link all of that together. Those photos become linked  and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it  and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. Their own photos are getting tagged with meta data that somebody else entered. If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are  then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data  and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space  into that meta verse  using everybody else's photos  and do a kind of a cross modal and cross user social experience that way. And of course  a by product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth  collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on  but from the collective memory. Thank you so much. Chris Anderson  Do I understand this right  What your software is going to allow  is that at some point  really within the next few years  all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together  BAA  Yes. What this is really doing is discovering  creating hyperlinks  if you will  between images. It's doing that based on the content inside the images. And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have. Like when you do a web search for images  you type in phrases  and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. What if that picture links to all of your pictures  The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect. CA  Truly incredible. Congratulations. I'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it. Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk. Shortly after I saw that  we had some friends over for dinner with the family. The conversation turned to global warming  and everybody agreed  there's a real problem. We've got a climate crisis. So  we went around the table to talk about what we should do. The conversation came to my    year old daughter  Mary. She said   I agree with everything that's been said. I'm scared and I'm angry.  And then she turned to me and said   Dad  your generation created this problem  you'd better fix it.  Wow. All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me. I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is   There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.  And we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences  we must act  and we must act decisively. I've got to tell you  for me  everything changed that evening. And so  my partners and I  we set off on this mission to learn more  to try to do much more. So  we mobilized. We got on airplanes. We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India  to Bentonville  Arkansas  to Washington  D.C. and to Sacramento. And so  what I'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys. Because the more we learned  the more concerned we grew. You know  my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers  and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine  we just get together the smartest people we know. For this climate crisis  we assembled a network  really  of superstars  from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders. Fifty or so of them. And so  I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons I've learned in the last year. The first lesson is that companies are really powerful  and that matters a lot. This is a story about how Wal Mart went green  and what that means. Two years ago  the CEO  Lee Scott  believed that green is the next big thing  and so Wal Mart made going green a top priority. They committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by    percent  and their new stores by    percent  and do all that in seven years. The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning  then lighting  and then refrigeration. So  look what they did. They painted the roofs of all their stores white. They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands. And  third  they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with LED lighting. I mean  why would you try to refrigerate a whole store  These are really simple  smart solutions based on existing technology. Why does Wal Mart matter  Well  it's massive. They're the largest private employer in America. They're the largest private user of electricity. They have the second largest vehicle fleet on the road. And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains         suppliers. If Wal Mart were a country  it would be the sixth largest trading partner with China. And maybe most important  they have a big effect on other companies. When Wal Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable  it has a powerful impact on other great institutions. So  let me tell you this  when Wal Mart achieves    percent energy reductions  that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough. We need Wal Mart and every other company to do the same. The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter  and they matter enormously. I've got another Wal Mart story for you  OK  Wal Mart has over     million U.S. customers. That's a third of the U.S. population.    million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. And Wal Mart has committed they're going to sell another     million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy. Consumers don't really like these light bulbs. The light's kind of funny  they won't dim  takes a while for them to start up. But the pay off is really enormous.     million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we'll save     million dollars in energy bills  and    million tons of CO  every year  year in and year out. It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing. It is stupid that we use two tons of steel  glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall. It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here. It's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know  Do you know how much CO  you generated to drive here or fly here  I don't know  and I should. Those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were. But as long as we pretend that CO  is free  as long as these uses are nearly invisible  how can we expect change  I'm really afraid  because I think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough. The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters. In fact  policy is paramount. I've got a behind the scenes story for you about that green tech network I described. At the end of our first meeting  we got together to talk about what the action items would be  how we'd follow up. And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up. You know  Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase. Well  Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento  California that we need a market based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. It's necessary and  just as important  it's good for the California economy. So  eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB  . You know what  Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill  so it passed  and it passed by a vote of    to   . Please. Thank you. I think it's the most important legislation of     . Why  Because California was the first state in this country to mandate    percent reduction of greenhouse gases by     . And the result of that is  we're going to generate        new jobs  four billion dollars a year in annual income  and reduce the CO  emissions by     million tons a year. California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO  emissions. It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO  emissions. It's a great start  but I've got to tell you    where I started    I'm really afraid. In fact  I'm certain California's not enough. Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from. You know Tom Friedman says   If you don't go  you don't know   Well  we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg. He's the father of the ethanol revolution. He told us that Brazil's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol. And they mandated that their new vehicles would be flex fuel compatible  right  They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline. And so  here's what's happened in Brazil. They now have        ethanol pumps    this versus     in the U.S.  and a paltry two in California    and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to    percent flex fuel. Compare that to the U.S.  five percent are flex fuel. And you know what  Most consumers who have them don't even know it. So  what's happened in Brazil is  they've replaced    percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol. That's    billion dollars since      that they didn't ship to the Middle East. It's created a million jobs inside that country  and it's saved    million tons of CO . It's really substantial. That's    percent of the CO  emissions across their entire country. But Brazil's only  .  percent of the world's CO  emission. So  Brazil's ethanol miracle  I'm really afraid  is not enough. In fact  I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. The fourth and final lesson we've learned is about the potential of radical innovation. So  I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology. Every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease. That's malaria.       people a day. All for want of two dollars' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore. Well  two dollars  two dollars is too much for Africa. So  a team of Berkeley researchers with    million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering  designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient  called artemisinin  and they're going to make that drug    times cheaper. And in doing so  they'll save a million lives    at least a million lives a year. A million lives. Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology. This leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products. Now  what you do is  you get inside the microbe  you change its metabolic pathways  and you end up with a living chemical factory. Now  you may ask  John  what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis  Well  I'll tell you    a lot. We've now formed a company called Amyris  and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels. Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal. That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way. So  if all goes well  they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels. I guess that's better living through bugs. Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it. And  of course  at Kleiner we  kind of  apologize and say the second best way is to finance it. And that's why we're investing     million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies. And we're encouraging others to do it as well. We're talking a lot about this. In       there were     million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in      to  .  billion dollars. But I'm really afraid we need much  much more. For reference  fact one  Exxon's revenues in      were a billion dollars a day. Do you know  they only invested  .  percent of revenues in R D  Second fact  the President's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total. Less than one day of Exxon's revenues. Third fact  I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years. And the federal budget calls for a measly    million dollars of R D in geothermal energy. It is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country. And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough. So  in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises. Who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green  Who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation  Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in South America  And who would have thought that scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels  And who would have thought that all that is not enough  Not enough to stabilize the climate. Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean. The scientists tell us    and they're only guessing    that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half  and do it as fast as possible. Now  we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.  but I've got to tell you  we've got only one atmosphere  and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China. To size the problem  China's CO  emissions today are  .  gigatons  the U.S. is  . . Business as usual means we'll have    gigatons from China by     . That's about as much CO  as there is in the whole world. And if it's business as usual  we're going out of business. When I was in Davos  China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO  strategy  and he said the following   You know  Americans use seven times the CO  per capita as Chinese.  Then he asked   Why should China sacrifice our growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid   Does anybody here have an answer for him  I don't. We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome  the profitable outcome  and therefore the likely outcome. Energy's a six trillion dollar business worldwide. It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet  Well  I'll tell you what. Green technologies    going green    is bigger than the Internet. It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the   st century. Moreover  if we succeed  it's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since  as Bill Joy says  we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere. Now  here's the hard question  if the trajectory of all the world's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough  what are we going to do  I don't know. Everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another. So  our call to action    my call to you    is for you to make going green your next big thing  your gig. What can you do  You can personally get carbon neutral. Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating  lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions. There's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed. And the most important thing you can do  I think  is to use your personal power and your Rolodex to lead your business  your institution  in going green. Do it like Wal Mart  get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself. Really think outside the box. Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen  It could be bigger than Wal Mart. I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis. And I really  really hope that we multiply all of our energy  all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem. Because if we do  I can look forward to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in    years. Thank you very much  Chris. Everybody who came up here said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared  but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this. And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at. There are no slides  so you'll just have to be content with me. What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa. Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time  the Africa of HIV AIDS  the Africa of malaria  the Africa of poverty  the Africa of conflict  and the Africa of disasters. While it is true that those things are going on  there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. And sometimes I'm puzzled  and I ask myself why. This is the Africa that is changing  that Chris alluded to. This is the Africa of opportunity. This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies. And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this. That's what I want to talk about today. And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa. On   th of September       Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha  a governor of one of the oil rich states of Nigeria  was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London. He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family. This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria    led by one of our most able and courageous people  Mr. Nuhu Ribadu. Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London. Due to some slip ups  he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where  according to our constitution  those in office as governors  president    as in many countries    have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened  people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office. Today  Alams    as we call him for short    is in jail. This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders. This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good  and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite. And therefore  when you hear about the corrupt Africa    corruption all the time    I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries  and that some successes are emerging. Does it mean the problem is over  The answer is no. There's still a long way to go  but that there's a will there. And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight. So when you hear about corruption  don't just feel that nothing is being done about this    that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case. There's a will to fight  and in many countries  that fight is ongoing and is being won. In others  like mine  where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria  the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go. But the truth of the matter is that this is going on. The results are showing  independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption  and governance is improving. A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in    African countries. And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance. That is that people talk about corruption  corruption. All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa. That's the image  African countries. But let me say this  if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London    if the other people who had taken money  estimated at    to    billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries    if they're able to do this  what is that  Is that not corruption  In this country  if you receive stolen goods  are you not prosecuted  So when we talk about this kind of corruption  let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe    where the money's going and what can be done to stop it. I'm working on an initiative now  along with the World Bank  on asset recovery  trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad    developing countries' moneys    to get that sent back. Because if we can get the    billion dollars sitting out there back  it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together. The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform. Africans  after    they're tired  we're tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care. We are grateful  but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform. And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it. We can invite partners who can support us  but we have to start. We have to reform our economies  change our leadership  become more democratic  be more open to change and to information. And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent  Nigeria. In fact  if you're not in Nigeria  you're not in Africa. I want to tell you that. One in four sub Saharan Africans is Nigerian  and it has     million dynamic people    chaotic people    but very interesting people. You'll never be bored. What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves. And with the support of a leader who was willing  at the time  to do the reforms  we put forward a comprehensive reform program  which we developed ourselves. Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank  where I worked for    years and rose to be a vice president. No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself. We put together a program that would  one  get the state out of businesses it had nothing    it had no business being in. The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent. So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises. We    as a result  we decided to liberalize many of our markets. Can you believe that prior to this reform    which started at the end of       when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister    we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop       landlines in its entire    year history  Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury. You couldn't get it. You had to bribe. You had to do everything to get your phone. When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector  we went from       landlines to    million GSM lines  and counting. Nigeria's telecoms market is the second fastest growing in the world  after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms. And nobody knows  except a few smart people. The smartest one  first to come in  was the MTN company of South Africa. And in the three years that I was Finance Minister  they made an average of     million dollars profit per year.     million in a market    in a country that is a poor country  with an average per capita income just under     dollars per capita. So the market is there. When they kept this under wraps  but soon others got to know. Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies  and three or four others have come in. But there's a huge market out there  and people don't know about it  or they don't want to know. So privatization is one of the things we've done. The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better. Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well. And Nigeria  with the oil sector  had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well. So what did we try to do  We introduced a fiscal rule that de linked our budget from the oil price. Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in  because oil is the biggest  most revenue earning sector in the economy     percent of our revenues come from oil. We de linked that  and once we did it  we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price. We didn't know we could pull it off  it was very controversial. But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development    where  even if oil prices were high  we would grow very fast. When they crashed  we crashed. And we could hardly even pay anything  any salaries  in the economy. That smoothened out. We were able to save  just before I left     billion dollars. Whereas    and this went to our reserves    when I arrived in       we had seven billion dollars in reserves. By the time I left  we had gone up to almost    billion dollars. And as we speak now  we have about    billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances. And that shores up our economy  makes it stable. Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy. We brought inflation down from    percent to about    percent. And we had GDP grow from an average of  .  percent the previous decade to about  .  percent now. So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy. And what is more important  because we want to get away from oil and diversify    and there are so many opportunities in this one big country  as in many countries in Africa    what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone  but from non oil. Agriculture grew at better than eight percent. As telecoms sector grew  housing and construction  and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro economy straightened out  the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous. We have opportunities in agriculture  like I said. We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible  that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world. We have opportunities in housing and real estate. There was nothing in a country of     million people    no shopping malls as you know them here. This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people. And now  we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected. So  huge things in construction  real estate  mortgage markets. Financial services  we had    banks. Too many not doing their real business. We consolidated them from    to    banks by requiring that they increase their capital    share capital. And it went from about    million dollars to     million dollars. The banks    these banks are now consolidated  and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside. Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in     million. Standard Chartered has brought in     million. And I can go on. Dollars  on and on  into the system. We are doing the same with the insurance sector. So in financial services  a great deal of opportunity. In tourism  in many African countries  a great opportunity. And that's what many people know East Africa for  the wildlife  the elephants  and so on. But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important. So what am I trying to say  I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. A new wave of openness and democratization in which  since       more than two thirds of African countries have had multi party democratic elections. Not all of them have been perfect  or will be  but the trend is very clear. I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years  the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about  .  percent to about five percent per annum. This is better than the performance of many OECD countries. So it's clear that things are changing. Conflicts are down on the continent  from about    conflicts a decade ago  we are down to three or four conflicts    one of the most terrible  of course  of which is Darfur. And  you know  you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent  it looks like the entire continent is affected. But you should know that this continent is not    is a continent of many countries  not one country. And if we are down to three or four conflicts  it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable  growing  exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity. And I want to just make one point about this investment. The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet. And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs. There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine. But imagine the impact on a family  if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school  that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves. If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet  isn't that a wonderful opportunity  Isn't that the way to go  And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time. Otherwise  I would have liked you to have seen this. It says   Africa  Open for Business.  And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year. Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania  where they're having the session in June. But it shows you Africans  and particularly African women  who against all odds have developed businesses  some of them world class. One of the women in this video  Adenike Ogunlesi  making children's clothes    which she started as a hobby and grew into a business. Mixing African materials  such as we have  with materials from elsewhere. So  she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys  with African material mixed in. Very creative designs  has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal Mart. For        pieces. So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing. And the women are diligent. They are focused  they work hard. I could go on giving examples  Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda  who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing     other women and men to work with her. However  many of these are starved for capital to expand  because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market. Nobody thinks there's opportunity. But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now  will miss it forever. So if you want to be in Africa  think about investing. Think about the Beatrices  think about the Adenikes of this world  who are doing incredible things  that are bringing them into the global economy  whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed  and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income. So I invite you to explore the opportunities. When you go to Tanzania  listen carefully  because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent  for the people and for yourselves. Thank you very much.
