So  I guess it is a result of globalization that you can find Coca Cola tins on top of Everest and a Buddhist monk in Monterey. And so I just came  two days ago  from the Himalayas to your kind invitation. So I would like to invite you  also  for a while  to the Himalayas themselves. And to show the place where meditators  like me  who began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute  and found their way to the mountains. So these are a few images I was lucky to take and be there. There's Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet    wonderful setting. This is from Marlboro country. This is a turquoise lake. A meditator. This is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet  on August  . And the night before  we camped  and my Tibetan friends said   We are going to sleep outside.  And I said   Why  We have enough space in the tent.  They said   Yes  but it's summertime.  So now  we are going to speak of happiness. As a Frenchman  I must say that there are a lot of French intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting. I just wrote an essay on happiness  and there was a controversy. And someone wrote an article saying   Don't impose on us the dirty work of happiness.   We don't care about being happy. We need to live with passion. We like the ups and downs of life. We like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while.  This is what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas. It's about two meters by three  and you are all welcome any time. Now  let's come to happiness or well being. And first of all  you know  despite what the French intellectuals say  it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking   May I suffer the whole day   Which means that somehow  consciously or not  directly or indirectly  in the short or the long term  whatever we do  whatever we hope  whatever we dream    somehow  is related to a deep  profound desire for well being or happiness. As Pascal said  even the one who hangs himself  somehow  is looking for cessation of suffering. He finds no other way. But then  if you look in the literature  East and West  you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness. Some people say  I only believed in remembering the past  imagining the future  never the present. Some people say happiness is right now  it's the quality of the freshness of the present moment. And that led Henri Bergson  the French philosopher  to say   All the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague so that each of them could define their own terms.  Well  that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life. But now  if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life  then we better know what it is  have some clearer idea. And probably  the fact that we don't know that is why  so often  although we seek happiness  it seems we turn our back to it. Although we want to avoid suffering  it seems we are running somewhat towards it. And that can also come from some kind of confusions. One of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure. But if you look at the characteristics of those two  pleasure is contingent upon time  upon its object  upon the place. It is something that    changes of nature. Beautiful chocolate cake  first serving is delicious  second one not so much  then we feel disgust. That's the nature of things. We get tired. I used to be a fan of Bach. I used to play it on the guitar  you know. I can hear it two  three  five times. If I had to hear it    hours  non stop  it might be very tiring. If you are feeling very cold  you come near a fire  it's so wonderful. After some moments  you just go a little back  and then it starts burning. It sort of uses itself as you experience it. And also  again  it can    also  it's something that you    it is not something that is radiating outside. Like  you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot. Now  what  then  will be happiness  And happiness  of course  is such a vague word  so let's say well being. And so  I think the best definition  according to the Buddhist view  is that well being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation. It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment. A state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states  and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way. For you  that might be surprising. Can we have this kind of well being while being sad  In a way  why not  Because we are speaking of a different level. Look at the waves coming near the shore. When you are at the bottom of the wave  you hit the bottom. You hit the solid rock. When you are surfing on the top  you are all elated. So you go from elation to depression    there's no depth. Now  if you look at the high sea  there might be beautiful  calm ocean  like a mirror. There might be storms  but the depth of the ocean is still there  unchanged. So now  how is that  It can only be a state of being  not just a fleeting emotion  sensation. Even joy    that can be the spring of happiness. But there's also wicked joy  you can rejoice in someone's suffering. So how do we proceed in our quest for happiness  Very often  we look outside. We think that if we could gather this and that  all the conditions  something that we say   Everything to be happy    to have everything to be happy.  That very sentence already reveals the doom  destruction of happiness. To have everything. If we miss something  it collapses. And also  when things go wrong  we try to fix the outside so much  but our control of the outer world is limited  temporary  and often  illusory. So now  look at inner conditions. Aren't they stronger  Isn't it the mind that translates the outer condition into happiness and suffering  And isn't that stronger  We know  by experience  that we can be what we call  a little paradise   and yet  be completely unhappy within. The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal  and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere. So one evening  he said   Look  you are doing all these things  but isn't it nice  also  to build something within   And he said    Without  that    even if you get a high tech flat on the    th floor of a super modern and comfortable building  if you are deeply unhappy within  all you are going to look for is a window from which to jump.  So now  at the opposite  we know a lot of people who  in very difficult circumstances  manage to keep serenity  inner strength  inner freedom  confidence. So now  if the inner conditions are stronger    of course  the outer conditions do influence  and it's wonderful to live longer  healthier  to have access to information  education  to be able to travel  to have freedom. It's highly desirable. However  this is not enough. Those are just auxiliary  help conditions. The experience that translates everything is within the mind. So then  when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness  the inner conditions  and which are those which will undermine happiness. So then  this just needs to have some experience. We have to know from ourselves  there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing  to this well being  what the Greeks called eudaimonia  flourishing. There are some which are adverse to this well being. And so  if we look from our own experience  anger  hatred  jealousy  arrogance  obsessive desire  strong grasping  they don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it. And also  they are detrimental to others' happiness. So we may consider that the more those are invading our mind  and  like a chain reaction  the more we feel miserable  we feel tormented. At the opposite  everyone knows deep within that an act of selfless generosity  if from the distance  without anyone knowing anything about it  we could save a child's life  make someone happy. We don't need the recognition. We don't need any gratitude. Just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature. And we would like to be like that all the time. So is that possible  to change our way of being  to transform one's mind  Aren't those negative emotions  or destructive emotions  inherent to the nature of mind  Is change possible in our emotions  in our traits  in our moods  For that we have to ask  what is the nature of mind  And if we look from the experiential point of view  there is a primary quality of consciousness that's just the mere fact to be cognitive  to be aware. Consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it. You can have ugly faces  beautiful faces in the mirror. The mirror allows that  but the mirror is not tainted  is not modified  is not altered by those images. Likewise  behind every single thought there is the bare consciousness  pure awareness. This is the nature. It cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then  if it was always there    like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth    then it would be found all the time  somewhere. We know we're not always angry  always jealous  always generous. So  because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone  there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting. That is the ground for mind training. Mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time. You could go from love to hate. But you cannot  at the same time  toward the same object  the same person  want to harm and want to do good. You cannot  in the same gesture  shake hand and give a blow. So  there are natural antidotes to emotions that are destructive to our inner well being. So that's the way to proceed. Rejoicing compared to jealousy. A kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense grasping and obsession. Benevolence  loving kindness against hatred. But  of course  each emotion then would need a particular antidote. Another way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions  and that's by looking at the very nature. Usually  when we feel annoyed  hatred or upset with someone  or obsessed with something  the mind goes again and again to that object. Each time it goes to the object  it reinforces that obsession or that annoyance. So then  it's a self perpetuating process. So what we need to look for now is  instead of looking outward  we look inward. Look at anger itself. It looks very menacing  like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm. We think we could sit on the cloud  but if you go there  it's just mist. Likewise  if you look at the thought of anger  it will vanish like frost under the morning sun. If you do this again and again  the propensity  the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it. And  at the end  although it may rise  it will just cross the mind  like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track. So this is the principal of mind training. Now  it takes time  because it took time for all those faults in our mind  the tendencies  to build up  so it will take time to unfold them as well. But that's the only way to go. Mind transformation    that is the very meaning of meditation. It means familiarization with a new way of being  new way of perceiving things  which is more in adequation with reality  with interdependence  with the stream and continuous transformation  which our being and our consciousness is. So  the interface with cognitive science  since we need to come to that  it was  I suppose  the subject of    we have to deal in such a short time    with brain plasticity. The brain was thought to be more or less fixed. All the nominal connections  in numbers and quantities  were thought  until the last    years  to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age. Now  recently  it has been found that it can change a lot. A violinist  as we heard  who has done        hours of violin practice  some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain changes a lot  increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections. So can we do that with human qualities  With loving kindness  with patience  with openness  So that's what those great meditators have been doing. Some of them who came to the labs  like in Madison  Wisconsin  or in Berkeley  did    to        hours of meditation. They do  like  three years' retreat  where they do meditate    hours a day. And then  the rest of their life  they will do three or four hours a day. They are real Olympic champions of mind training. This is the place where the meditators    you can see it's kind of inspiring. Now  here with     electrodes. So what did they find  Of course  same thing. The scientific embargo    if it's ever submitted to  Nature   hopefully  it will be accepted. It deals with the state of compassion  unconditional compassion. We asked meditators  who have been doing that for years and years  to put their mind in a state where there's nothing but loving kindness  total availability to sentient being. Of course  during the training  we do that with objects. We think of people suffering  of people we love  but at some point  it can be a state which is all pervading. Here is the preliminary result  which I can show because it's already been shown. The bell curve shows     controls  and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe. In very short  people who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex are more depressed  withdrawn. They don't describe a lot of positive affect. It's the opposite on the left side  more tendency to altruism  to happiness  to express  and curiosity and so forth. So there's a basic line for people. And also  it can be changed. If you see a comic movie  you go off to the left side. If you are happy about something  you'll go more to the left side. If you have a bout of depression  you'll go to the right side. Here  the   .  is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion. It's something that is totally out of the bell curve. So  I've no time to go into all the different scientific results. Hopefully  they will come. But they found that    this is after three and a half hours in an fMRI  it's like coming out of a space ship. Also  it has been shown in other labs    for instance  Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley    that some meditators are able  also  to control their emotional response more than it could be thought. Like the startle experiments  for example. If you sit a guy on a chair with all this apparatus measuring your physiology  and there's kind of a bomb that goes off  it's such an instinctive response that  in    years  they never saw anyone who would not jump. Some meditators  without trying to stop it  but simply by being completely open  thinking that that bang is just going to be a small event like a shooting star  they are able not to move at all. So the whole point of that is not  sort of  to make  like  a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump  or whatever. It's more to say that mind training matters. That this is not just a luxury. This is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul. This is something that's going to determine the quality of every instant of our lives. We are ready to spend    years achieving education. We love to do jogging  fitness. We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful. Yet  we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most    the way our mind functions    which  again  is the ultimate thing that determines the quality of our experience. Now  compassion is supposed to be put in action. That's what we try to do in different places. Just this one example is worth a lot of work. This lady with bone TB  left alone in a tent  was going to die with her only daughter. One year later  how she is. Different schools and clinics we've been doing in Tibet. And just  I leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than I could ever say. And jumping monks of Tibet. Flying monks. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you a little bit about user generated content. I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that's going to tell you a little bit about how we open user generated content up for business. So  here's the first story.     . This man  John Philip Sousa  traveled to this place  the United States Capitol  to talk about this technology  what he called the  quote   talking machines.  Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines. This is what he had to say.  These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy  in front of every house in the summer evenings  you would find young people together singing the songs of the day  or the old songs. Today  you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a vocal chord left   Sousa said.  The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution as was the tail of man when he came from the ape.  Now  this is the picture I want you to focus on. This is a picture of culture. We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read write culture. It's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re creation of their culture. In that sense  it's read write. Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these  quote   infernal machines.  They would take it away. And in its place  we'd have the opposite of read write culture  what we could call read only culture. Culture where creativity was consumed but the consumer is not a creator. A culture which is top down  owned  where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost. Now  as you look back at the twentieth century  at least in what we think of as the  quote   developed world     hard not to conclude that Sousa was right. Never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized  never before as concentrated. Never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced  and displaced because of these  quote   infernal machines.  The twentieth century was that century where  at least for those places we know the best  culture moved from this read write to read only existence. So  second. Land is a kind of property    it is property. It's protected by law. As Lord Blackstone described it  land is protected by trespass law  for most of the history of trespass law  by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward. Now  that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land  until this technology came along  and people began to wonder  were these instruments trespassers as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country  Well  in       Supreme Court got a chance to address that question. Two farmers  Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby  who raised chickens  had a significant complaint because of these technologies. The complaint was that their chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes and flew themselves into the walls of the barn when the airplanes flew over the land. And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing. Since time immemorial  the law had said  you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner  so this flight must stop. Well  the Supreme Court considered this     years tradition and said  in an opinion written by Justice Douglas  that the Causbys must lose. The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world  otherwise every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits. Common sense  a rare idea in the law  but here it was. Common sense    Revolts at the idea. Common sense. Finally. Before the Internet  the last great terror to rain down on the content industry was a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting  a new way to spread content  and therefore a new battle over the control of the businesses that would spread content. Now  at that time  the entity  the legal cartel  that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ASCAP. They had an exclusive license on the most popular content  and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge. So  between      and       they raised rates by some     percent  until the broadcasters finally got together and said  okay  enough of this. And in       a lawyer  Sydney Kaye  started something called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI. And BMI was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire  including African American music for the first time in the repertoire. But most important was that BMI took public domain works and made arrangements of them  which they gave away for free to their subscribers. So that in       when ASCAP threatened to double their rates  the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI. Now  ASCAP said they didn't care. The people will revolt  they predicted  because the very best music was no longer available  because they had shifted to the second best public domain provided by BMI. Well  they didn't revolt  and in       ASCAP cracked. And the important point to recognize is that even though these broadcasters were broadcasting something you would call second best  that competition was enough to break  at that time  this legal cartel over access to music. Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument. In my view  the most significant thing to recognize about what this Internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read write culture that Sousa romanticized. Digital technology is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal chords that he spoke so passionately to Congress about. User generated content  spreading in businesses in extraordinarily valuable ways like these  celebrating amateur culture. By which I don't mean amateurish culture  I mean culture where people produce for the love of what they're doing and not for the money. I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time. For when you think of what Sousa romanticized in the young people together  singing the songs of the day  of the old songs  you should recognize what your kids are doing right now. Taking the songs of the day and the old songs and remixing them to make them something different. It's how they understand access to this culture. So  let's have some very few examples to get a sense of what I'm talking about here. Here's something called Anime Music Video  first example  taking anime captured from television re edited to music tracks. This one you should be    confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry. And this is the best. My love ... There's only you in my life ... The only thing that's bright ... My first love ... You're every breath that I take ... You're every step I make ... And I .... I want to share all my love with you ... No one else will do ... And your eyes ... They tell me how much you care ... So  this is remix  right  And it's important to emphasize that what this is not is not what we call  quote   piracy.  I'm not talking about nor justifying people taking other people's content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner. I'm talking about people taking and recreating using other people's content  using digital technologies to say things differently. Now  the importance of this is not the technique that you've seen here. Because  of course  every technique that you've seen here is something that television and film producers have been able to do for the last    years. The importance is that that technique has been democratized. It is now anybody with access to a        computer who can take sounds and images from the culture around us and use it to say things differently. These tools of creativity have become tools of speech. It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak. It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are as they increasingly understand digital technologies and their relationship to themselves. Now  in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies  the law has not greeted this Sousa revival with very much common sense. Instead  the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies  as they interact  have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal. Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies  then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy. Every single use therefore requires permission  without permission  you are a trespasser. You're a trespasser with about as much sense as these people were trespassers. Common sense here  though  has not yet revolted in response to this response that the law has offered to these forms of creativity. Instead  what we've seen is something much worse than a revolt. There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate  in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies. One side builds new technologies  such as one recently announced that will enable them to automatically take down from sites like YouTube any content that has any copyrighted content in it  whether or not there's a judgment of fair use that might be applied to the use of that content. And on the other side  among our kids  there's a growing copyright abolitionism  a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do  rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible. The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other  a fact we should have learned many  many times over  and both extremes in this debate are just wrong. Now  the balance that I try to fight for  I  as any good liberal  try to fight for first by looking to the government. Total mistake  right  Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense. It failed partly because the courts are too passive  partly because the legislatures are corrupted  by which I don't mean that there's bribery operating to stop real change  but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand this until it's too late to fix it. So  we need something different  we need a different kind of solution. And the solution here  in my view  is a private solution  a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again  and to realize the economic potential of that  and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant. Because  as BMI demonstrated  competition here can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now. We don't have a public domain to draw upon now  so instead what we need is two types of changes. First  that artists and creators embrace the idea  choose that their work be made available more freely. So  for example  they can say their work is available freely for non commercial  this amateur type of use  but not freely for any commercial use. And second  we need the businesses that are building out this read write culture to embrace this opportunity expressly  to enable it  so that this ecology of free content  or freer content  can grow on a neutral platform where they both exist simultaneously  so that more free can compete with less free  and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition can teach one the lessons of the other. Now  I would talk about one particular such plan that I know something about  but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling  so I'm not going to talk about this at all. I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us. That artist choice is the key for new technology having an opportunity to be open for business  and we need to build artist choice here if these new technologies are to have that opportunity. But let me end with something I think much more important    much more important than business. It's the point about how this connects to our kids. We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us  right  We made mixed tapes  they remix music. We watched TV  they make TV. It is technology that has made them different  and as we see what this technology can do  we need to recognize you can't kill the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it. We can't stop our kids from using it. We can only drive it underground. We can't make our kids passive again. We can only make them  quote   pirates.  And is that good  We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions  where in many areas of our life  we live life constantly against the law. Ordinary people live life against the law  and that's what I    we are doing to our kids. They live life knowing they live it against the law. That realization is extraordinarily corrosive  extraordinarily corrupting. And in a democracy  we ought to be able to do better. Do better  at least for them  if not for opening for business. Thank you very much. There's an ancient and universal concept that words have power  that spells exist  and that if we could only pronounce the right words  then    whooosh    you know  an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits  right  So this is a very attractive idea because we're very lazy  like the sorcerer's apprentice  or the world's greatest computer programmer. And so this idea has a lot of traction with us. We love the idea that words  when pronounced    they're just little more than pure information  but they evoke some physical action in the real world that helps us do work. And so  of course  with lots of programmable computers and robots around this is an easy thing to picture. So how many of you know what I'm talking about  Raise your right hand. OK. How many of you don't know what I'm talking about  Raise your left hand. So that's great. So that was too easy. You guys have very insecure computers  OK  So now  the thing is that this is a different kind of spell. This is a computer program made of zeros and ones. It can be pronounced on a computer. It does something like this. The important thing is we can write it in a high level language. A computer magician can write this thing. It can be compiled into this    into zeros and ones    and pronounced by a computer. And that's what makes computers powerful  these high level languages that can be compiled. And so  I'm here to tell you  you don't need a computer to actually have a spell. In fact  what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information    you encode a spell or program as molecules    then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program. That's what happens in proteins. When this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms  these little letters are sticky for each other. It collapses into a three dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts DNA. And the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence  you change the three dimensional folding. You get now a DNA stapler instead. These are the kind of molecular programs that we want to be able to write  but the problem is  we don't know the machine language of proteins. We don't have a compiler for proteins. So I've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA. We use DNA because it's cheaper. It's easier to handle. It's something that we understand really well. We understand it so well  in fact  that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers. So then  we think we can do that. And my first question doing this    or one of my questions doing this    was how can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA  And I decided to use a type of DNA origami  where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want. So here's a shape. I actually spent about a year in my home  in my underwear  coding  like Linus  Torvalds   in that picture before. And this program takes a shape  spits out     DNA sequences. These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you send an e mail with these sequences in it to a company  and what it does    the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer. It's a machine about the size of a photocopier. And what happens is  they take your e mail and every letter in your e mail  they replace with    atom cluster    one for each letter  A  T  C  and G in DNA. They string them up in the right sequence  and then they send them back to you via FedEx. So you get     of these in the mail in little tubes. I mix them together  add a little bit of salt water  and then add this long strand I was telling you about  that I've stolen from a virus. And then what happens is  you heat this whole thing up to about boiling. You cool it down to room temperature  and as you do  what happens is those short strands  they do the following thing  each one of them binds that long strand in one place  and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place  and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together. And so the net effect of all     of these strands is to fold the long strand into the shape that you're looking for. It'll approximate that shape. We do this for real in the test tube. In each little drop of water you get    billion of these guys. You can look with a microscope and see them on a surface. And the neat thing is that if you change the sequence and change the spell  you just change the sequence of the staples. You can make a molecule that looks like this  and  you know  he likes to hang out with his buddies  right. And a lot of them are actually pretty good. If you change the spell again  you change the sequence again. You get really nice     nanometer triangles. If you do it again  you can get arbitrary patterns. So on a rectangle you can paint patterns of North and South America  or the words   DNA.  So that's DNA origami. That's one way. There are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA. What we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self assembly so that we can build anything  right  We want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world. We want to learn how to build biological artifacts  like people and whales and trees. And if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity  if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good  then that will truly be magic. Thank you very much. You've all seen lots of articles on climate change  and here's yet another New York Times article  just like every other darn one you've seen. It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen. It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen. What's unusual about this one  maybe  is that it's from     . And the reason I'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent. That people have just sort of figured out about it  and now with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something  we may be on the road to a solution. The fact is    uh uh. We've known about this problem for    years  depending on how you count it. We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so. And we've accomplished close to zip. This is the growth rate of CO  in the atmosphere. You've seen this in various forms  but maybe you haven't seen this one. What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating. And that it's accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back. So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible  that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line. But in fact  they're growing faster. Here's some data from actually just    days ago  which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice  and it's the lowest by far. And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models. So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel  and politicians signing treaties    in fact  you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative  because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel.  Laughter  No  no  In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing    our big economy    we've really hardly started. Really  we're doing this  basically. Really  not very much. I don't want to depress you too much. The problem is absolutely soluble  and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap. Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military  not the cost of medical care. Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP. No  this is really important to have this sense of scale. So the problem is soluble  and the way we should go about solving it is  say  dealing with electricity production  which causes something like    or so percent and rising of CO  emissions. And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation  and wind power  nuclear power and coal to CO  capture  which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment  and work. All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place. Instead  we spend our time talking. But nevertheless  that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight. What I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing. And it's this stuff in the middle here  which is what you do if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough. And you need to deal    somehow break the link between human actions that change climate  and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important because  of course  while we can adapt to climate change    and it's important to be honest here  there will be some benefits to climate change. Oh  yes  I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it. But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers    not all losers. But  of course  the natural world  polar bears. I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic. They will completely lose. And there's no adaption. So this problem is absolutely soluble. This geo engineering idea  in it's simplest form  is basically the following. You could put signed particles  say sulfuric acid particles    sulfates    into the upper atmosphere  the stratosphere  where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet. And I know for certain that that will work. Not that there aren't side effects  but I know for certain it will work. And the reason is  it's been done. And it was done not by us  not by me  but by nature. Here's Mount Pinatubo in the early '  s. That put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb like cloud. The result of that was pretty dramatic. After that  and some previous volcanoes we have  you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere. So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere  the stratosphere  and it heats up after these volcanoes. But you'll notice that in the upper bar  which is the lower atmosphere and the surface  it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit. There's no big mystery about it. There's lots of mystery in the details  and there's some bad side effects  like it partially destroys the ozone layer    and I'll get to that in a minute. But it clearly cools down. And one other thing  it's fast. It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do  like slowing emissions  are intrinsically slow  because it takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions. And not only that  when you cut emissions  you don't cut concentrations  because concentrations  the amount of CO  in the air  is the sum of emissions over time. So you can't step on the brakes very quickly. But if you do this  it's quick. And there are times you might like to do something quick. Another thing you might wonder about is  does it work  Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO   and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally  And the answer seems to be yes. So here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before. That's what the world looks like  under one particular climate model's view  with twice the amount of CO  in the air. The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO  and  .  percent less sunlight  and you're back to the original climate. And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came  because Ken    at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid '  s    Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said   Geo engineering won't work.  And to the person who was promoting it said   The atmosphere's much more complicated.  Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation. Ken went and ran his models  and found that it did. This topic is also old. That report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old        . That report  in fact  which had all the modern climate science    the only thing they talked about doing was geo engineering. It didn't even talk about cutting emissions  which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem. I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions. We should  but it made exactly this point. So  in a sense  there's not much new. The one new thing is this essay. So I should say  I guess  that since the time of that original President Johnson report  and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy                        people always talked about this idea. Not as something that was foolproof  but as an idea to think about. But when climate became  politically  a hot topic    if I may make the pun    in the last    years  this became so un PC  we couldn't talk about it. It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it. But in the last year  Paul Crutzen published this essay saying roughly what's all been said before  that maybe  given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts  we should think about things like this. He said roughly what's been said before. The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry. And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this  even though there will be some ozone impacts. And in fact  he had some ideas to make them go away. There was all sorts of press coverage  all over the world  going right down to  Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth   from the Economist. And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off  but not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night. And I thought about this child's toy    hence  the title of my talk    and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round in the child's radiometer  to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there. One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly. The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer  and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer. And it turns out  I woke up the next morning  and I started to calculate this. It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped. But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere. So it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere  about     kilometers up  that already have this effect. I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works. There are a lot of fun complexities that I'd love to spend the whole evening on  but I won't. But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated. So the side facing the sun is warmer  the side away  cooler. Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm. And so you see a net force away from the sun. That's called the photophoretic force. There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators have thought about how to exploit. And of course  we may be wrong    this hasn't all been peer reviewed  we're in the middle of thinking about it    but so far  it seems good. But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes    much longer than before    because they're levitated. We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere  in principle solving the ozone problem. I'm sure there will be other problems that arise. Finally  we could make the particles migrate to over the poles  so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles. Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet  where we live  and do the maximum job of what we might need to do  which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency  if you like. This is a new idea that's crept up that may be  essentially  a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in. Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right  I think it's almost certain we will eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in. That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this  it's amazing how we can affect the planet. The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage. This improved science and engineering will  whether we like it or not  give us more and more leverage to affect the planet  to control the planet  to give us weather and climate control    not because we plan it  not because we want it  just because science delivers it to us bit by bit  with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it. Now  suppose that space aliens arrived. Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here  or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot    but suppose they arrive and they give you a box. And the box has two knobs. One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature. Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO  concentrations. You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box. Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs. We have no global governance. And different people will have different places they want it set. Now  I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely. But we're building that box. The scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece  in their labs. Even when they're doing it for other reasons. Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment. They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet. They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do. And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it    I do not    but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously. Because sooner or later  we'll be confronted with decisions about this  and it's better if we think hard about it  even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it. I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it. But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this. We need a broader debate. A debate that involves musicians  scientists  philosophers  writers  who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are. So here's one way to think about it  which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper. I guess the thing I haven't said about this is  it is absurdly cheap. It's conceivable that  say  using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with  you could create an ice age at a cost of .    percent of GDP. It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage. It's not a good idea  but it's just important.  Laughter  I'll tell you how big the lever is  the lever is that big. And that calculation isn't much in dispute. You might argue about the sanity of it  but the leverage is real.  Laughter  So because of this  we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions  and just as the concentrations go up  we can increase the amount of geo engineering. I don't think anybody takes that seriously. Because under this scenario  we walk further and further away from the current climate. We have all sorts of other problems  like ocean acidification that come from CO  in the atmosphere  anyway. Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this. But here's a case which is harder to reject. Let's say that we don't do geo engineering  we do what we ought to do  which is get serious about cutting emissions. But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them. There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much. So let's say that we work hard  and we actually don't just tap the brakes  but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations. And maybe someday    like       October       we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side. And we have global celebrations  and we've actually started to    you know  we've seen the worst of it. But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast  fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next     years  and remove some of the biggest cities from the map. That's an absolutely possible scenario. We might decide at that point that even though geo engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy  that it's a lot better than not geo engineering. And that's a very different way to look at the problem. It's using this as risk control  not instead of action. It's saying that you do some geo engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off  not that you'd use it as a substitute for action. But there is a problem with that view. And the problem is the following  knowledge that geo engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome  and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today. This is what economists call a moral hazard. And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about  and  in general  I think it's the underlying reason that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this. But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer. I'll leave you with three questions  and then one final quote. Should we do serious research on this topic  Should we have a national research program that looks at this  Not just at how you would do it better  but also what all the risks and downsides of it are. Right now  you have a few enthusiasts talking about it  some in a positive side  some in a negative side    but that's a dangerous state to be in because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic. A very small amount of money would get us some. Many of us    maybe now me    think we should do that. But I have a lot of reservations. My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem  and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard. I think there is a serious problem  as you talk about this  people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions. Another thing is  maybe we need a treaty. A treaty that decides who gets to do this. Right now we may think of a big  rich country like the U.S. doing this. But it might well be that  in fact  if China wakes up in      and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable  they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this  and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo engineered world than a non geo engineered world. And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision. So here's one last thought  which was said much  much better    years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today. And I think it really summarizes where we are here. That the CO  problem  the climate problem that we've heard about  is driving lots of things    innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions    but also  I think  inevitably  it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control  whether we like it or not. And it's time to begin thinking about it  even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it. Thank you very much. What is bioenergy  Bioenergy is not ethanol. Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building that bridge to the future  to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way  or put up these geo spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff  is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do that  you really have to look first at agriculture. So we've been planting stuff for        years. And in the measure that we plant stuff  what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests  you've got to deal with all types of awful things  you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate  then you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile. You're going to be able to power stuff  so irrigation makes a difference. Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it  as opposed to where the rivers flood. You start getting this organic agriculture  you start putting machinery onto this stuff. Machinery  with a whole bunch of water  leads to very large scale agriculture. You put together machines and water  and you get landscapes that look like this. And then you get sales that look like this. It's brute force. So what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system. You start taming that natural system. You put a lot of force behind that natural system. You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides    end up with systems that look like this. And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've been approaching energy. So the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology. And you move from a discipline of engineering  you move from a discipline of chemistry  into a discipline of biology. And probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me. This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of people have criticized. But of course  those are people who don't realize that China and India  instead of having huge amounts of starving people  are exporting grains. And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research  which was Mexico  didn't adopt this technology  ignored this technology  talked about why this technology should be thought about  but not really applied. And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn't apply technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in fact  hasn't recognized this man  to the point where there aren't statues of this man all over Mexico. There are in China and India. And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India. That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies. Now  it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world. It's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does  if you understand biology. What happened in agriculture  Well  if you take agriculture over a century  agriculture in about      would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah  the plows look different. The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules  but the farmer would have understood  this is what the guy's doing  this is why he's doing it  this is where he's going. What really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology  and that's where you get your productivity increases. And as you do that stuff  here's what happens to productivity. Basically  you go from     hours to produce     bushels  to     to     to five. Agricultural labor productivity increased seven times       to       whereas the rest of the economy increased about  .  times. This is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person. The effect of this  of course  is it's not just amber waves of grain  it is mountains of stuff. And    percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced. This would be a good outcome for energy. And of course  by now  you're probably saying to yourself   Self  I thought I came to a talk about energy and here's this guy talking about biology.  So where's the link between these two things  One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand. We don't even know what oil is. We don't know where oil comes from. I mean  literally  it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from. The best assumption  and one of the best guesses in this stuff  is that this stuff comes out of this stuff  that these things absorb sunlight  rot under pressure for millions of years  and you get these black rivers. Now  the interesting thing about that thesis    if that thesis turns out to be true    is that oil  and all hydrocarbons  turned out to be concentrated sunlight. And if you think of bioenergy  bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is taking the sun  concentrating it in amoebas  concentrating it in plants  and maybe that's why you get these rainbows. And as you're looking at this system  if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight  then bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels. Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas  the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots. This is how you farm oil. And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved  we started with this brute force approach. And then what did we learn  Then we learned we had to go bigger. And then what'd we learn  Then we have to go even bigger. And we are getting really destructive as we're going out and farming this bioenergy. These are the Athabasca tar sands  and there's an enormous amount    first of mining  the largest trucks in the world are working here  and then you've got to pull out this black sludge  which is basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it  which only works at today's oil prices. Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants  except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure. So you take something like this  you burn it  you put it under pressure  and likely as not  you get this. Although  again  I stress  we don't know. Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But as you think of coal  this is what burned wheat kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal. And of course  coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines  you get gas. When that gas blows up  people die. So you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines  but not in others. Any place you see a differential  there're some interesting questions. There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff. But again  coal. Maybe the same stuff  maybe the same system  maybe bioenergy  and you're applying exactly the same technology. Here's your brute force approach. Once you get through your brute force approach  then you just rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions  which are coal fired gas plants. That is probably not the best use of bioenergy. As you think of what are the alternatives to this system    it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in its petroleum reserves  but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves  nor is China. There are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there  and we've got to start thinking of them as biological energy  because if we keep treating them as chemical energy  or engineering energy  we're going to be in deep doo doo. Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological product. And as you think of gas  well  you're familiar with gas. And here's a different way of mining coal. This is called coal bed methane. Why is this picture interesting  Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life  the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another    the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up    may be because there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas. This is a well known phenomenon.  Laughter  You eat certain things  you produce a lot of gas. It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process. If that is true  then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off  and it may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture. That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture  from brute force into biological force. And in the measure that you can do that  you can clean some stuff  and you can clean it pretty quickly. We already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff. OK  if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades  you can get a really substantial increase  like an eight fold increase  in your output. This is just the beginning stages of this stuff. And as you think of biomaterials  this guy    who did part of the sequencing of the human genome  who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world    has been thinking about how you structure this. And there's a series of smart people thinking about this. And they've been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics  like  a Cambria  like Codon  and what those companies are trying to do is to think of  how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force  Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes. Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the genes as a software. And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable  that can become energy  that can become food  that can become fiber  that can become human beings  that can become a whole series of things  then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way. What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading  This is one of the gentle giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes    something called restriction enzymes. He was at Hopkins when he did this  and he's such a modest guy that the day he won  his mother called him and said   I didn't realize there was another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just won the Nobel    Laughter  I mean  that was Mom  but anyway  this guy is just a class act. You find him at the bench every single day  working on a pipette and building stuff. And one of the things this guy just built are these things. What is this  This is the first transplant of naked DNA  where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell  insert it into a different cell  and have that cell boot up as a separate species. That's one month old. You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff. And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are  we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies. We're going to start thinking about biology entering energy. It is very expensive to process this stuff  both in economic terms and in energy terms. This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand  and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor    steam to separate this stuff    you also have to separate out the sulfur. The difference between light crude and heavy crude    well  it's about    bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way  the scale on these things is pretty large. Now  if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this  you reduce the system  and you really do start applying biological principles to energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind  to the point where you can get to solar  to the point where you can get to nuclear    and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault.  Laughter  Just a thought. But in the meantime  for the next decade at least  the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that oil  be that gas  be that coal  this is what we're dealing with. And before I make this talk too long  here's what's happening in the current energy system.    percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons. That means    percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a role in here for conservation. There's a role in here for alternative stuff  but we've also got to get that other portion right. How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future. And as we think of this bridge to the future  one of the things you should ponder is  we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there. Which  of course  requires more energy to go out and get energy. The ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy output. That is a stupid way of managing this system. Last point  last graph. One of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This is what oil prices look like  OK  This is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up with really smart ideas for solar panels  or for wind  or for something else  and then guess what  The oil price goes through the floor. That company goes out of business  and then you can bring the oil price back up. So if I had one closing and modest suggestion  let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States. How do you do that  Well  let's put a tax on oil that is a non revenue tax  and it basically says for the next    years  the price of oil will be    whatever you want     bucks     bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that  we tax it. If the OPEC price goes above that  the tax goes away. What does that do for entrepreneurs  What does it do for companies  It tells people  if you can produce energy for less than    bucks a barrel  or less than    bucks a barrel  or less than    bucks a barrel    let's debate it    you will have a business. But let's not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as OPEC drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening. Thank you. I'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it  the problems and the opportunities that we face  and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic. And then I'll let you in on a secret  which is why I am an incurable optimist. Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before. Now  you've all seen  Inconvenient Truth.  This is a little more inconvenient. Because  with our present knowledge  we have no idea what would happen. Even now  man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate through the waste products of his civilization. Due to our release  through factories and automobiles every year  of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide    which helps air absorb heat from the sun    our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer. This is bad  Well  it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps. And if this happens  an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley. Tourists in glass bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through     feet of tropical water. For  in weather  we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters  but with life itself. Larry Brilliant  Should we feel good  or should we feel bad that    years of foreknowledge accomplished so little  Well  it depends  really  on what your goals are. And I think  as my goals  I always go back to Gandhi's talisman. When Mahatma Gandhi was asked   How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong one   he said   Consider the face of the poorest  most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon  and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person. And if it will be  it's the right thing to do  and if not  rethink it.  For those of us in this room  it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual  it's the community  it's the culture  it's the world itself. And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society  who are the poorest and the most vulnerable  the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism. But there's also a wonderful case for optimism. Let's review them both. First of all  the megatrends. There's two degrees  or three degrees of climate change baked into the system. It will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands. It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable  as will the increasing rise of population. Even though we've dodged Paul Ehrlich's population bomb  and we will not see    billion people in this decade  as he had forecast  we eat as if we were    billion. And we consume so much that again  a rise of  .  billion to  .  billion in our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poorest and the most vulnerable. That's why they migrate to cities. That's why in June of this year  we passed  as a species     percent of us living in cities  and bustees  and slums  and shantytowns. The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did. The green revolution never reached Africa. And with desertification  sandstorms  the Gobi Desert  the Ogaden  we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare to produce as many calories as it did even    years ago. So humans are turning more towards animal consumption. In Africa last year  Africans ate     million wild animals  and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat. And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted  the genomic sequences of which we don't know. Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of  but we are ripe for zoonotic borne  emerging communicable diseases. Increasingly  I would say explosive growth of technology. Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side    in bioweapons  and in technology that puts us on a collision course to magnify any anger  hatred or feeling of marginalization. And in fact  with increasing globalization    for which there are big winners and even bigger losers    today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history. One percent of us own    percent of all the goods and services. What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next    years  The one percent will own even more than    percent of all the world's goods and services. Not because they've grown richer  but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer. Last week  Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said   This situation is unprecedented  unequal  unfair and unstable.  So there's lots of reason for pessimism. Darfur is  at its origin  a resource war. Last year  there were        riots in China      a day  that required police or military intervention. Most of them were about resources. We are facing an unprecedented number  scale of disasters. Some are weather related  human rights related  epidemics. And the newly emerging diseases may make H N  and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world. And unlike destabilized world in the past  it will be broadcast to you on YouTube  you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones. What will that lead to  For some  it will lead to anger  religious and sectarian violence and terrorism. For others  withdrawal  nihilism  materialism. For us  where does it take us  as social activists and entrepreneurs  As we look at these trends  do we become despondent  or will we become energized  Let's look at one case  the case of Bangladesh. First  even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today  global warming would continue. And even with global warming    if you can see these blue lines  the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today  the next decades will see rising sea levels. A minimum of    to    inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for  and it could be    times that. What will that do to Bangladesh  Let's take a look. So here's Bangladesh.    percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level. Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas. And we'll watch as global warming makes them melt. More water comes down  the deforested areas  here in the Tarai  will be unable to absorb the effluent  because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water. Now we're looking down south  through the Kali Gandaki. Many of you  I think  have probably trekked here. And we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water coming from the north  and in the seas rising from the south. Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh. And now let's look from the south  looking up  and let's see this in relief. A minimum of    to    inches of increase in seas  coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas. And take a look at this. As many as     million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate into India and into China. This is the difficulty that one country faces. But if you look at the globe  all around the earth  wherever there is low lying area  populated areas near the water  you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life. Sub Saharan Africa  and even our own San Francisco Bay Area. We're all in this together. This is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know. Global warming is something that happens to all of us  all at once. As are these newly emerging communicable diseases  names that you hadn't heard    years ago  ebola  lhasa fever  monkey pox. With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans  we live in each other's viral environment. Do you remember     years ago  no one had ever heard of West Nile fever  And then we watched  as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States and it marched every year  westwardly. Do you remember no one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it  It's just the beginning  unfortunately. There have been    novel emerging communicable diseases that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last    years. It's more than enough reason for pessimism. But now let's look at the case for optimism.  Laughter  Enough of the bad news. Human beings have always risen to the challenge. You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves. We've been here before  paralyzed by fear  paralyzed into inaction  when some    probably one of you in this room    jumped into the breach and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility  which fought against the nuclear threat  Medicins Sans Frontieres  that renewed our commitment to disaster relief  Mohamed ElBaradei  and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us  and our own Muhammad Yunus. We've seen the eradication of smallpox. We may see the eradication of polio this year. Last year  there were only       cases in the world. We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year    there are only        cases left in the world.    years ago  there were three and a half million. And we've seen a new disease  not like the    novel emerging communicable diseases. This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome.  Laughter  It's an amazing phenomenon. All throughout the technology world  we're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome. But they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did. They're not waiting until they die to create foundations. They're actively guiding their money  their resources  their hearts  their commitments  to make the world a better place. Certainly  nothing can give you more optimism than that. More reasons to be optimistic  in the '  s  and I am a creature of the '  s  there was a movement. We all felt that we were part of it  that a better world was right around the corner  that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice. Today  there's another kind of movement. It's a movement to save the earth. It's just beginning. Five weeks ago  a group of activists from the business community gathered together to stop a Texas utility from building nine coal fired electrical plants that would have contributed to destroying the environment. Six months ago  a group of business activists gathered together to join with the Republican governor in California to pass AB     the most far reaching legislation in environmental history. Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness. Can you imagine   Laughter  We're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago I would not have believed  as the evangelical community has understood the desperate situation of global warming. And now       churches have joined the environmental movement. It is something to be greatly optimistic about. The European          plan is an amazing breakthrough  something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon. And on April   th  there will be Step Up Day  where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest against legislation    pushing for legislation to stop global warming. And on July  th  around the world  I learned only yesterday  there will be global Live Earth concerts. And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air. Now  that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most. That means that people are beginning the first step  which is acting out of their own self interest. But I am seeing in the major funders  in CARE  Rockefeller  Rockefeller Brothers Fund  Hewlett  Mercy Corps  you guys  Google  so many other organizations  a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming  but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming on the poorest and the most vulnerable. But for me  I have another reason to be an incurable optimist. And you've heard so many inspiring stories here  and I heard so many last night that I thought I would share a little bit of mine. My background is not exactly conventional medical training. And I lived in a Himalayan monastery  and I studied with a very wise teacher  who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny    it felt like Yoda    it is your destiny to go to work for WHO and to help eradicate smallpox  at a time when there was no smallpox program. It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history. In the last century    that's the one that was seven years ago    half a billion people died from smallpox  more than all the wars in history  more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world. In the Summer of Love  in       two million people  children  died of smallpox. It's not ancient history. When you read the biblical plague of boils  that was smallpox. Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth  whose picture is here  died of smallpox. To eradicate smallpox  we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history. We visited every house in India  searching for smallpox        million houses  once every month  for nearly two years. In a cruel reversal  after we had almost conquered smallpox    and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur  the realm of the final inch. When we had almost eradicated smallpox  it came back again  because the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers  who could come there and get employment. And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox  and they went home to die. And when they did  they took smallpox to    other countries and reignited the epidemic. And we had to start all over again. But  in the end  we succeeded  and the last case of smallpox  this little girl  Rahima Banu    Barisal  in Bangladesh    when she coughed or breathed  and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus  thus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror. How can that not make you optimistic  A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India  and blinded half of all of those who were made blind in India  ended. And most importantly for us here in this room  a bond was created. Doctors  health workers  from    different countries  of every race  every religion  every color  worked together  fought alongside each other  fought against a common enemy  didn't fight against each other. How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future  Thank you very much. I want you to imagine that you're a student in my lab. What I want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design. And so here's the challenge  I want you to help me create a fully  D  dynamic  parameterized contact model. The translation of that is  could you help me build a foot  And it is a true challenge  and I do want you to help me. Of course  in the challenge there is a prize. It's not quite the TED Prize  but it is an exclusive t shirt from our lab. So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot. Now if we want to design a foot  what do we have to do  We have to first know what a foot is. If we go to the dictionary  it says   It's the lower extremity of a leg that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking  That's the traditional definition. But if you wanted to really do research  what do you have to do  You have to go to the literature and look up what's known about feet. So you go to the literature.  Laughter  Maybe you're familiar with this literature. The problem is  there are many  many feet. How do you do this  You need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work. And I want you to help me do that in this next clip. As you see this clip  look for principles  and also think about experiments that you might design in order to understand how a foot works. See any common themes  Principles  What would you do  What experiments would you run  Wow.  Applause  Our research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot. It's a design inspired by nature  but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at  but it's a synthesis of the secrets of many  many feet. Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere. They can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw    in the probability of contact  the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present. If you want to study how a foot works  we're going to have to simulate those surfaces  or simulate that debris. When we did that  here's a new experiment that we did  we put an animal and had it run    this grass spider    on a surface with    percent of the contact area removed. But it didn't even slow down the animal. It's still running at the human equivalent of     miles per hour. Now how could it do that  Well  look more carefully. When we slow it down    times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris. The leg is acting as a foot. And in fact  the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot. The foot is distributed along the whole leg. You can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot  and you can remove its foot. I'm passing some cockroaches around. Take a look at their feet. Without a foot  here's what it does. It doesn't even slow down. It can run the same speed without even that segment. No problem for the cockroach    they can grow them back  if you care. How do they do it  Look carefully  this is slowed down     times  and watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg. It's acting  again  as a distributed foot    very effective. Now  the question we had is  how general is a distributed foot  And the next behavior I'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it. Journalists  this is off the record  it's embargoed. Take a look at what that is  That's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut. It was discovered by Christina Huffard and filmed by Sea Studios  right here from Monterey. We've also described another species of bipedal octopus. This one disguises itself as floating algae. It walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can't be seen. And look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain. It uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there    truly extraordinary. In       Escher made this drawing. He thought he created an animal fantasy. But we know that art imitates life  and it turns out nature  three million years ago  evolved the next animal. It's a shrimp like animal called the stomatopod  and here's how it moves on the beaches of Panama  it actually rolls  and it can even roll uphill. It's the ultimate distributed foot  its whole body in this case is acting like its foot. So  if we want to then  to our blueprint  add the first important feature  we want to add distributed foot contact. Not just with the traditional foot  but also the leg  and even of the body. Can this help us inspire the design of novel robots  We biologically inspired this robot  named RHex  built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years. RHex's foot started off to be quite simple  then it got tuned over time  and ultimately resulted in this half circle. Why is that  The video will show you. Watch where the robot  now  contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain. What you'll see  in fact  is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot. Watch it go over this. You can see it here well on this debris. Extraordinary. No sensing  all the control is built right into the tuned legs. Really simple  but beautiful. Now  you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain. And my assistant's going to help me here. When you touched the cockroach leg    can you get the microphone for him  When you touched the cockroach leg  what did it feel like  Did you notice something  Boy  Spiny. Robert Full  It's spiny  right  It's really spiny  isn't it  It sort of hurts. Maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach. Chris Anderson  Did you touch it  RF  So if you look carefully at this  what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago  no one knew what they did. They assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures. We found that they're for something else    here's a segment of that spine. They're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris  but they're stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface. Now crabs don't miss footholds  because they normally move on sand    until they come to our lab. And where they have a problem with this kind of mesh  because they don't have spines. The crabs are missing spines  so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain. But of course  we can deal with that because we can produce artificial spines. We can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out. We did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs  as you see here  and then we tested them. Do we really understand that principle of tuning  The answer is  yes  This is slowed down    fold  and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris. A little better than nature. So to our blueprint  we need to add tuned spines. Now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots  Well  here's RHex  RHex has trouble on rails    on smooth rails  as you see here. So why not add a spine  My colleagues did this at U. Penn. Dan Koditschek put some steel nails    very simple version    on the robot  and here's RHex  now  going over those steel    those rails. No problem  How does it do it  Let's slow it down and you can see the spines in action. Watch the leg come around  and you'll see it grab on right there. It couldn't do that before  it would just slip and get stuck and tip over. And watch again  right there    successful. Now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces. This is really  really difficult. But look at this animal do it  One of the ones I'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that's a smooth metal plate. It's extraordinary how fast it can do it    but if you slow it down  you see something that's quite extraordinary. It's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look    and doing  actually  terribly  with respect to grabbing on the surface. It looks  in fact  like it's swimming up the surface. We can actually model that behavior better as a fluid  if you look at it. The distributed foot  actually  is working more like a paddle. The same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand. Watch its feet. It's actually functioning as a paddle even though it's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid. This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself. Can you use this to make a better robot  Martin Buehler did    who's now at Boston Dynamics    he took this idea and made RHex to be Aqua RHex. So here's RHex with paddles  now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot. For rough surfaces  though  animals add claws. And you probably feel them if you grabbed it. Did you touch it  CA  I did. RF  And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws. Mark Cutkosky at Stanford University  one of my collaborators  is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing  where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot. And here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit. So to our blueprint  let's attach claws. Now if we look at animals  though  to be really maneuverable in all surfaces  the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws  and spines  and hairs  and pads  and glue  and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other things. These are all from different insects. There's an ant crawling up a vertical surface. Let's look at that ant. This is the foot of an ant. You see the hairs and the claws and this thing here. This is when its foot's in the air. Watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich. You see what happens  That pad comes out. And that's where the glue is. Here from underneath is an ant foot  and when the claws don't dig in  that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything. It just extrudes. And this was a hard shot to get    I think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings. So it's pretty tough to do. This is what it looks like close up    here's the ant foot  and there's the glue. And we discovered this glue may be an interesting two phase mixture. It certainly helps it to hold on. So to our blueprint  we stick on some sticky pads. Now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here. Now we have something better here. The gecko's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature. These are its feet. They're    almost look alien. And the secret  which they stick on with  involves their hairy toes. They can run up a surface at a meter per second  take    steps in that one second    you can hardly see them. If we slow it down  they attach their feet at eight milliseconds  and detach them in    milliseconds. And when you watch how they detach it  it is bizarre. They peel away from the surface like you'd peel away a piece of tape. Very strange. How do they stick  If you look at their feet  they have leaf like structures called linalae with millions of hairs. And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible. It has a hundred to a thousand split ends  and that's the secret  because it allows intimate contact. The gecko has a billion of these     nanometer sized split ends. And they don't stick by glue  or they don't work like Velcro  or they don't work with suction. We discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone. So to our blueprint  we split some hairs. This has inspired the design of the first self cleaning dry adhesive    the patent issued  we're happy to say. And here's the simplest version in nature  and here's my collaborator Ron Fearing's attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane. And here's the first attempt to have it work on some load. There's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields. You could think of a thousand possible uses  I'm sure. Lots of people have  and we're excited about realizing this as a product. We have imagined products  for example  this one  we imagined a bio inspired Band Aid  where we took the glue off the Band Aid. We took some hairs from a molting gecko  put three rolls of them on here  and then made this Band Aid. This is an undergraduate volunteer    we have        undergraduates so we can choose among them    that's actually just a red pen mark. But it makes an incredible Band Aid. It's aerated  it can be peeled off easily  it doesn't cause any irritation  it works underwater. I think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity based research    we just wondered how they climbed up something    can lead to things that you could never imagine. It's just an example of why we need to support curiosity based research. Here you are  pulling off the Band Aid. So we've redefined  now  what a foot is. The question is  can we use these secrets  then  to inspire the design of a better foot  better than one that we see in nature  Here's the new project  we're trying to create the first climbing search and rescue robot    no suction or magnets    that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces. I call the new robot RiSE  for  Robot in Scansorial Environment     that's a climbing environment    and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot. And here is RiSE. It's six legged and has a tail. Here it is on a fence and a tree. And here are RiSE's first steps on an incline. You have the audio  You can hear it go up. And here it is coming up at you  in its first steps up a wall. Now it's only using its simplest feet here  so this is very new. But we think we got the dynamics right of the robot. Mark Cutkosky  though  is taking it a step further. He's the one able to build this shape deposition manufactured feet and toes. The next step is to make compliant toes  and try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives. So the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right  attempt to make that climb  and ultimately put it on the robot. And that's exactly what he's done. He's built  in fact  a climbing foot bot inspired by nature. And here's Cutkosky's and his amazing students' design. So these are tuned toes    there are six of them  and they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint. So this is not using any suction  any glue  and it will ultimately  when it's attached to the robot    it's as biologically inspired as the animal    hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface. Here you see it  next  going up the side of a building at Stanford. It's sped up    again  it's a foot climbing. It's not the whole robot yet  we're working on it    now you can see how it's attaching. These tuned structures allow the spines  friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging  difficult surfaces. And so they were able to get this thing    this is now sped up    times    can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor  OK  You can visualize this now  it's not impossible. It's a very challenging task. But more to come later. To finish  we've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built. We've learned we should distribute control to smart parts. Don't put it all in the brain  but put some of the control in tuned feet  legs and even body. That nature uses hybrid solutions  not a single solution  to these problems  and they're integrated and beautifully robust. And third  we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology  and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make    potentially    something better than nature. So there's a clear message  whether you care about a fundamental  basic research of really interesting  bizarre  wonderful animals  or you want to build a search and rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake  or to save someone in a fire  or you care about medicine  we must preserve nature's designs. Otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. Thank you. I want to start my story in Germany  in       with a mathematician named Georg Cantor. And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line  and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process  a recursive process. So he starts out with one line  and then two  and then four  and then     and so on. And if he does this an infinite number of times  which you can do in mathematics  he ends up with an infinite number of lines  each of which has an infinite number of points in it. So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity. And this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium.  Laughter  And when he came out of the sanitarium  he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be God Himself. He was a very religious man. He was a mathematician on a mission. And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing. A Swedish mathematician  von Koch  decided that instead of subtracting lines  he would add them. And so he came up with this beautiful curve. And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape  we can use any seed shape we like. And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere    down there  OK    and now upon iteration  that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure. So these all have the property of self similarity  the part looks like the whole. It's the same pattern at many different scales. Now  mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down  you measure a longer and longer length. And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times  as the ruler shrinks down to infinity  the length goes to infinity. This made no sense at all  so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books. They said these are pathological curves  and we don't have to discuss them. And that worked for a hundred years. And then in       Benoit Mandelbrot  a French mathematician  realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals  you get the shapes of nature. You get the human lungs  you get acacia trees  you get ferns  you get these beautiful natural forms. If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet    go ahead and do that now       and relax your hand  you'll see a crinkle  and then a wrinkle within the crinkle  and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right  Your body is covered with fractals. The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes  They were breathing those words with fractal lungs. It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here. Again  we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape. So here's the second iteration  and the third  fourth and so on. So nature has this self similar structure. Nature uses self organizing systems. Now in the     s  I happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village  you see fractals. And I thought   This is fabulous  I wonder why   And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why. So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals  which is a great job if you can get it. And so I finally got to this city  and I'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold    but when I got there  I got to the palace of the chief  and my French is not very good  I said something like   I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof.  But he was really cool about it  and he took me up there  and we talked about fractals. And he said   Oh yeah  yeah  We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle  we know all about that.  And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle  and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here. And as you go through the path  you have to get more and more polite. So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling  it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal. This is a village in southern Zambia. The Ba ila built this village about     meters in diameter. You have a huge ring. The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back  and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back and then the chief's immediate family in that ring. So here's a little fractal model for it. Here's one house with the sacred altar  here's the house of houses  the family enclosure  with the humans here where the sacred altar would be  and then here's the village as a whole    a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here  the chief's immediate family here  and here there's a tiny village only this big. Now you might wonder  how can people fit in a tiny village only this big  That's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors. And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village  right  So it's just like Georg Cantor said  the recursion continues forever. This is in the Mandara mountains  near the Nigerian border in Cameroon  Mokoulek. I saw this diagram drawn by a French architect  and I thought   Wow  What a beautiful fractal   So I tried to come up with a seed shape  which  upon iteration  would unfold into this thing. I came up with this structure here. Let's see  first iteration  second  third  fourth. Now  after I did the simulation  I realized the whole village kind of spirals around  just like this  and here's that replicating line    a self replicating line that unfolds into the fractal. Well  I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at. So  when I got to the village  I said   Can you take me to the square building  I think something's going on there.  And they said   Well  we can take you there  but you can't go inside because that's the sacred altar  where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields.  And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this. And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales. So here's a Nankani village in Mali. And you can see  you go inside the family enclosure    you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace  stacked recursively. Here's calabashes that Issa was just showing us  and they're stacked recursively. Now  the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul. And when she dies  they have a ceremony where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity. Once again  infinity is important. Now  you might ask yourself three questions at this point. Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture  And that was actually my original hypothesis. When I first saw those African fractals  I thought   Wow  so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society  that sort of hierarchy  must have a kind of bottom up architecture.  But that turns out not to be true. I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture  only the African ones were fractal. And if you think about it  all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use. So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry. You can see on the pottery and the baskets. Here's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins  you can see it's circular at the largest scale  but it's rectangular at the smaller scale  right  It is not the same pattern at two different scales. Second  you might ask   Well  Dr. Eglash  aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures   And three times  the answer is no. First of all  I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book   The Invention of Africa   that Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism  and then oppositional movements. No  because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture    and it definitely is not  in the DNA.  And finally  the fractals have self similarity    so they're similar to themselves  but they're not necessarily similar to each other    you see very different uses for fractals. It's a shared technology in Africa. And finally  well  isn't this just intuition  It's not really mathematical knowledge. Africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry  right  It wasn't invented until the     s. Well  it's true that some African fractals are  as far as I'm concerned  just pure intuition. So some of these things  I'd wander around the streets of Dakar asking people   What's the algorithm  What's the rule for making this   and they'd say   Well  we just make it that way because it looks pretty  stupid.   Laughter  But sometimes  that's not the case. In some cases  there would actually be algorithms  and very sophisticated algorithms. So in Manghetu sculpture  you'd see this recursive geometry. In Ethiopian crosses  you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape. In Angola  the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand  and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph  we now call it an Eulerian path    you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice. But they do it recursively  and they do it with an age grade system  so the little kids learn this one  and then the older kids learn this one  then the next age grade initiation  you learn this one. And with each iteration of that algorithm  you learn the iterations of the myth. You learn the next level of knowledge. And finally  all over Africa  you see this board game. It's called Owari in Ghana  where I studied it  it's called Mancala here on the East Coast  Bao in Kenya  Sogo elsewhere. Well  you see self organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game. And the folks in Ghana knew about these self organizing patterns and would use them strategically. So this is very conscious knowledge. Here's a wonderful fractal. Anywhere you go in the Sahel  you'll see this windscreen. And of course fences around the world are all Cartesian  all strictly linear. But here in Africa  you've got these nonlinear scaling fences. So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things  this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako  and I asked him   How come you're making fractal fences  Because nobody else is.  And his answer was very interesting. He said   Well  if I lived in the jungle  I would only use the long rows of straw because they're very quick and they're very cheap. It doesn't take much time  doesn't take much straw.  He said   but wind and dust goes through pretty easily. Now  the tight rows up at the very top  they really hold out the wind and dust. But it takes a lot of time  and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight.   Now   he said   we know from experience that the farther up from the ground you go  the stronger the wind blows.  Right  It's just like a cost benefit analysis. And I measured out the lengths of straw  put it on a log log plot  got the scaling exponent  and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook. So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology. The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry  it was in a symbolic code  and this was Bamana sand divination. And the same divination system is found all over Africa. You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast  and often the symbols are very well preserved  so each of these symbols has four bits    it's a four bit binary word    you draw these lines in the sand randomly  and then you count off  and if it's an odd number  you put down one stroke  and if it's an even number  you put down two strokes. And they did this very rapidly  and I couldn't understand where they were getting    they only did the randomness four times    I couldn't understand where they were getting the other    symbols. And they wouldn't tell me. They said   No  no  I can't tell you about this.  And I said   Well look  I'll pay you  you can be my teacher  and I'll come each day and pay you.  They said   It's not a matter of money. This is a religious matter.  And finally  out of desperation  I said   Well  let me explain Georg Cantor in     .  And I started explaining why I was there in Africa  and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set. And one of them said   Come here. I think I can help you out here.  And so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest. And of course  I was only interested in the math  so the whole time  he kept shaking his head going   You know  I didn't learn it this way.  But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed  buried in sand  and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on. And finally  he revealed the truth of the matter. And it turns out it's a pseudo random number generator using deterministic chaos. When you have a four bit symbol  you then put it together with another one sideways. So even plus odd gives you odd. Odd plus even gives you odd. Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even. It's addition modulo    just like in the parity bit check on your computer. And then you take this symbol  and you put it back in so it's a self generating diversity of symbols. They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this. Now  because it's a binary code  you can actually implement this in hardware    what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools. And the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical. In the   th century  Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain. And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy  divination through the earth. This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in     . Leibniz  the German mathematician  talked about geomancy in his dissertation called  De Combinatoria.  And he said   Well  instead of using one stroke and two strokes  let's use a one and a zero  and we can count by powers of two.  Right  Ones and zeros  the binary code. George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra  and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer. So all these little PDAs and laptops    every digital circuit in the world    started in Africa. And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers  but you know  I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno. So let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this. And you can go to our website  the applets are all free  they just run in the browser. Anybody in the world can use them. The National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools  so hopefully in three years  anybody'll be able to go on the Web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts. We've focused in the U.S. on African American students as well as Native American and Latino. We've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that did not have the software. So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics  that it's not just about singing and dancing. We've started a pilot program in Ghana. We got a small seed grant  just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this  we're very excited about the future possibilities for that. We've also been working in design. I didn't put his name up here    my colleague  Kerry  in Kenya  has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure  because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village  it doesn't quite fit. Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art. David Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture in which he's used some of these fractal structures. And finally  I just wanted to point out that this idea of self organization  as we heard earlier  it's in the brain. It's in the    it's in Google's search engine. Actually  the reason that Google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self organizing properties of the web. It's in ecological sustainability. It's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship  the ethical power of democracy. It's also in some bad things. Self organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast. And if you don't think that capitalism  which is self organizing  can have destructive effects  you haven't opened your eyes enough. So we need to think about  as was spoken earlier  the traditional African methods for doing self organization. These are robust algorithms. These are ways of doing self organization    of doing entrepreneurship    that are gentle  that are egalitarian. So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work  we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self organizing algorithms. Thank you.
