In the     s  there were so many right whales in Cape Cod Bay off the east coast of the U.S. that apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other. Today  they number in the hundreds  and they're endangered. Like them  many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced by     years of whaling  where they were hunted and killed for their whale meat  oil and whale bone. We only have whales in our waters today because of the Save the Whales movement of the '  s. It was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling  and was built on the idea that if we couldn't save whales  what could we save  It was ultimately a test of our political ability to halt environmental destruction. So in the early '  s  there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign. Whales in our waters are still low in numbers  however  because they do face a range of other human induced threats. Unfortunately  many people still think that whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful. This is actually a disservice  because whales are ecosystem engineers. They help maintain the stability and health of the oceans  and even provide services to human society. So let's talk about why saving whales is critical to the resiliency of the oceans. It boils down to two main things  whale poop and rotting carcasses. As whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe  they actually release these enormous fecal plumes. This whale pump  as it's called  actually brings essential limiting  nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they  stimulate the growth of phytoplankton  which forms the base of all marine food chains. So really  having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem. Whales are also known to undertake some  of the longest migrations of all mammals. Gray whales off America migrate        kilometers between productive feeding areas and less productive calving  or birthing  areas and back every year. As they do so  they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that have it to places that need it. So clearly  whales are really important in nutrient cycling  both horizontally and vertically  through the oceans. But what's really cool is that they're  also really important after they're dead. Whale carcasses are some of  the largest form of detritus to fall from the ocean's surface   and they're called whale fall. As these carcasses sink  they provide a feast to some     odd species  including the eel shaped  slime producing  hagfish. So over the     years of whaling  when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans  we likely altered the rate and geographic  distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans  and as a result  probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival. Whale carcasses are also known to transport about         tons of carbon  which is the equivalent of that produced by        cars per year from the atmosphere to the deep oceans  and the deep oceans are what we call  carbon sinks   because they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere  and therefore help to delay global warming. Sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land. The     years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between    to    percent. Clearly  the Save the Whales movement was instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on  but we need to revise this. We need to address the more modern  pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today. Amongst other things  we need to stop them from getting plowed down by container  ships when they're in their feeding areas  and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean. We also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages  so people really understand the true  ecosystem value of these creatures. So  let's save the whales again  but this time  let's not just  do it for their sake. Let's also do it for ours. Thank you. I have a confession to make. As a scientist and engineer  I've focused on efficiency for many years. But efficiency can be a cult  and today I'd like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality. A few years ago  after finishing my Ph.D.  in London  I moved to Boston. I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge. I bought a racing bicycle that summer  and I bicycled every day to work. To find my way  I used my phone. It sent me over Mass. Ave.  Massachusetts Avenue  the shortest route from Boston to Cambridge. But after a month that I was cycling every day on the car packed Mass. Ave.  I took a different route one day. I'm not entirely sure why I took a different route that day  a detour. I just remember a feeling of surprise  surprise at finding a street with no cars  as opposed to the nearby Mass. Ave. full of cars  surprise at finding a street  draped by leaves and surrounded by trees. But after the feeling  of surprise  I felt shame. How could I have been so blind  For an entire month  I was so trapped in my mobile app that a journey to work became one thing only  the shortest path. In this single journey  there was no thought of enjoying the road  no pleasure in connecting with nature  no possibility of looking people in the eyes. And why  Because I was saving a minute out of my commute. Now let me ask you  Am I alone here  How many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions  Most of you  if not all  have. And don't get me wrong    mapping apps are the greatest game changer for encouraging people to explore the city. You take your phone out and you know immediately where to go. However  the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the destination. It has the power to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination. After that experience  I changed. I changed my research from traditional data mining to understanding how people experience the city. I used computer science tools to replicate social science experiments at scale  at web scale. I became captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by Jane Jacobs  Stanley Milgram  Kevin Lynch. The result of that research has been the creation of new maps  maps where you don't only find the shortest path  the blue one  but also the most enjoyable path  the red one. How was that possible  Einstein once said   Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.  So with a bit of imagination  we needed to understand which parts of the city people find beautiful. At the University of Cambridge  with colleagues  we thought about this simple experiment. If I were to show you these two urban scenes  and I were to ask you which one is more beautiful  which one would you say  Don't be shy. Who says A  Who says B  Brilliant. Based on that idea  we built a crowdsourcing platform  a web game. Players are shown pairs of urban scenes  and they're asked to choose which one  is more beautiful  quiet and happy. Based on thousands of user votes  then we are able to see where consensus emerges. We are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy. After that work  I joined Yahoo Labs  and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano  and together  we aggregated those winning locations in London to build a new map of the city  a cartography weighted for human emotions. On this cartography  you're not only able to see and connect from point A to point B  the shortest segments  but you're also able to see the happy segment  the beautiful path  the quiet path. In tests  participants found the happy  the beautiful  the quiet path far more enjoyable than the shortest one  and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time. Participants also love to attach memories to places. Shared memories    that's where the old BBC building was  and personal memories    that's where I gave my first kiss. They also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded. So what if we had a mapping tool that would return the most enjoyable routes based not only on aesthetics but also based on smell  sound   and memories  That's where our research is going right now. More generally  my research  what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path  to avoid robbing people of fully experiencing the city in which they live. Walk the path through the park  not through the car park  and you have an entirely different path. Walk the path full of people you love and not full of cars  and you have an entirely different path. It's that simple. I would like to end with this thought  do you remember  The Truman Show   It's a media satire in which a real person doesn't know he's living in a fabricated world. Perhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency. Look at some of your daily habits  and as Truman did in the movie  escape the fabricated world. Why  Well  if you think that adventure is dangerous  try routine. It's deadly. Thank you. I'm a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder  but this is not how I started. When I was seven years old  I remember watching television and seeing people throwing rocks  and thinking  this must be a fun thing to do. So I got out to the street and threw rocks  not realizing I was supposed to throw rocks at Israeli cars. Instead  I ended up stoning my neighbors' cars.  Laughter  They were not enthusiastic about my patriotism. This is my picture with my brother. This is me  the little one  and I know what you're thinking   You used to look cute  what the heck happened to you   But my brother  who is older than me  was arrested when he was     taken to prison on charges of throwing stones. He was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones  and as a result  had internal injuries that caused his death soon after he was released from prison. I was angry  I was bitter  and all I wanted was revenge. But that changed when I was   . I decided that I needed Hebrew to get a job  and going to study Hebrew in that classroom was the first time I ever met Jews who were not soldiers. And we connected over really small things  like the fact that I love country music  which is really strange for Palestinians. But it was then that I realized also that we have a wall of anger  of hatred and of ignorance that separates us. I decided that it doesn't matter what happens to me. What really matters is how I deal with it. And therefore  I decided to dedicate my life to bringing down the walls that separate people. I do so through many ways. Tourism is one of them  but also media and education  and you might be wondering  really  can tourism change things  Can it bring down walls  Yes. Tourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls and to create a sustainable way of connecting with each other and creating friendships. In       I cofounded Mejdi Tours  a social enterprise that aims to connect people  with two Jewish friends  by the way  and what we'll do  the model we did  for example  in Jerusalem  we would have two tour guides  one Israeli and one Palestinian  guiding the trips together  telling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict from totally different perspectives. I remember running a trip together with a friend named Kobi    Jewish congregation from Chicago  the trip was in Jerusalem    and we took them to a refugee camp  a Palestinian refugee camp  and there we had this amazing food. By the way  this is my mother. She's cool. And that's the Palestinian food called maqluba. It means  upside down.  You cook it with rice and chicken  and you flip it upside down. It's the best meal ever. And we'll eat together. Then we had a joint band  Israeli and Palestinian musicians  and we did some belly dancing. If you don't know any  I'll teach you later. But when we left  both sides  they were crying because they did not want to leave. Three years later  those relationships still exist. Imagine with me if the one billion people who travel internationally  every year travel like this  not being taken in the bus from one side to another  from one hotel to another  taking pictures from the windows of their buses of people and cultures  but actually connecting with people. You know  I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K. going to the house of an Orthodox Jewish family  and having their first Friday night dinners  that Sabbath dinner  and eating together hamin  which is a Jewish food  a stew  just having the connection of realizing  after a while  that a hundred years ago  their families came out of the same place in Northern Africa. This is not a photo profile for your Facebook. This is not disaster tourism. This is the future of travel  and I invite you to join me to do that  to change your travel. We're doing it all over the world now  from Ireland to Iran to Turkey  and we see ourselves going everywhere to change the world. Thank you. Guatemala is recovering from a    year armed conflict. A conflict that was fought during the Cold War. It was really just  a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state. What we have as a result is         civilian victims          of those killed in the communities  small children  men  women   the elderly even. And then we have  about        others  the missing  the ones we're still looking for today. We call them the Desaparecidos. Now     percent of the victims  are Mayan victims  victims that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of  Central America. And only about    percent are of  European descent. But the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to  defend us  the police  the military  are the ones that committed most of the crimes. Now the families  they want information. They want to know what happened. They want the bodies of their loved ones. But most of all  what they want is they want you  they want everyone to know that their loved ones did nothing wrong. Now  my case was that my father received death threats in     . And we left. We left Guatemala and we came here. So I grew up in New York  I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact  and I went to New Utrecht High School and I graduated from Brooklyn College. The only thing was that I really didn't know what  was happening in Guatemala. I didn't care for it  it was too painful. But it wasn't till      that I decided to do something about it. So I went back. I went back to Guatemala   to look for the bodies  to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well. The way we work is that we give people information. We talk to the family members and we let them choose. We let them decide to tell us the stories  to tell us what they saw  to tell us about their loved ones. And even more important  we let them choose to give us a piece of themselves. A piece  an essence  of who they are. And that DNA is what we're  going to compare to the DNA that comes from the skeletons. While we're doing that  though  we're looking for the bodies. And these are skeletons by now  most of these crimes  happened    years ago. When we find the grave  we take out the dirt and eventually clean  the body  document it  and exhume it. We literally bring the  skeleton out of the ground. Once we have those bodies  though  we take them back to the city  to our lab  and we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things  One is how people died. So here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head or a machete wound  for example. The other thing we want to understand is who they are. Whether it's a baby  or an adult. Whether it's a woman or a man. But when we're done with that analysis what we'll do is we'll take a small  fragment of the bone and we'll extract DNA from it. We'll take that DNA and then we'll compare it with the DNA of the families  of course. The best way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases. The first is the case  of the military diary. Now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in     . And what you see there is the state following individuals  people that  like you   wanted to change their country  and they jotted everything down. And one of the things that they wrote  down is when they executed them. Inside that yellow rectangle   you see a code  it's a secret code     . And then you see a date. The     means  executed  and the date  means when they were executed. Now that's going to come into play in a second. What we did is we conducted an exhumation in       where we exhumed     bodies from    graves in a military base. Grave    though  matched the family of Sergio Saul Linares. Now Sergio was a professor at the university. He graduted from Iowa State University and went back to Guatemala to change his country. And he was captured on  February         . And if you can see there  he was  executed on March           which was incredible. We had the body  we had the family's  information and their DNA  and now we have documents that told us exactly what happened. But most important is about two weeks later  we go another hit  another match from the same grave to Amancio Villatoro. The DNA of that body also matched the DNA of that family. And then we noticed that he was also in the diary. But it was amazing to see that he was  also executed on March         . So that led us to think  hmm   how many bodies were in the grave  Six. So then we said  how many people were executed on March           That's right  six as well. So we have Juan de Dios  Hugo  Moises and Zoilo. All of them executed on the same date   all captured at different locations and at different moments. All put in that grave. The only thing we needed now was the DNA of those four families So we went and we looked for them and we found them. And we identified those six bodies and gave them back to the families. The other case I want to tell you about is that of a military base  called CREOMPAZ. It actually means   to believe in peace   but the acronym really means Regional Command Center for Peacekeeping Operations. And this is where the Guatemalan military trains peacekeepers from other countries  the ones that serve with the U.N. and go to countries like Haiti and the Congo. Well  we have testimony that said that within this military base  there were bodies  there were graves. So we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in  we found the first of    graves   a total of     bodies. Now  if you think about that  peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies. It's very ironic. But the bodies    face down  most of them  hands tied behind their backs  blindfolded  all types of trauma    these were people who were defenseless who were being executed. People that     families are looking for. So we're going to focus on Grave   . Grave     what we noticed  was a grave full of women and children     of them. And that immediately made us think  my goodness  where is there a case like this  When I got to Guatemala in       I heard of a case of a massacre that happened on May           where the army came in  killed the men  and took the women and children  in helicopters to an unknown location. Well  guess what  The clothing from this grave matched the  clothing from the region where these people were taken from  where these women and children  were taken from. So we conducted some DNA analysis  and guess what  We identified Martina Rojas  and Manuel Chen. Both of them disappeared in that case  and now we could prove it. We have physical evidence that proves that this happened and that those people  were taken to this base. Now  Manuel Chen was three years old. His mother went to the river to wash  clothes  and she left him with a neighbor. That's when the army came and that's when he was taken away in  a helicopter and never seen again until we found him in Grave   . So now with science  with archaeology   with anthropology  with genetics  what we're doing is  we're giving a voice to the voiceless. But we're doing more than that. We're actually providing  evidence for trials  like the genocide trial that happened  last year in Guatemala where General R os Montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to    years. So I came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere    it's happening in Mexico right in front of us today    and we can't let it go on anymore. We have to now come together and decide that we're not going to have  any more missing. So no more missing  guys. Okay  No more missing. Thank you. When the Portuguese arrived in Latin America about     years ago  they obviously found this amazing tropical forest. And among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before  they found one species that caught their attention very quickly. This species  when you cut the bark  you find a very dark red resin that was very good to paint and dye fabric to make clothes. The indigenous people called this species pau brasil  and that's the reason why this land became  land of Brasil   and later on  Brazil. That's the only country in the world that has the name of a tree. So you can imagine that it's very cool to be a forester in Brazil  among other reasons. Forest products are all around us. Apart from all those products  the forest is very important for climate regulation. In Brazil  almost    percent of the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the forest. Just the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere    billion tons of water every day. This is more than what the Amazon River  which is the largest river in the world  puts in the sea per day  which is    billion tons. If we had to boil water to get the same effect as evapotranspiration  we would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world. So it's a hell of a service for all of us. We have in the world about four billion hectares of forests. This is more or less China  U.S.  Canada and Brazil all together  in terms of size  to have an idea. Three quarters of that is in the temperate zone  and just one quarter is in the tropics  but this one quarter  one billion hectares  holds most of the biodiversity  and very importantly     percent of the living biomass  the carbon. Now  we used to have six billion hectares of forest       percent more than what we have          years ago. We've actually lost two billion hectares in the last       years. But in the last     years  we lost half of that. That was when we shifted from deforestation of temperate forests to deforestation of tropical forests. So think of this  In     years  we lost the same amount of forest in the tropics that we lost in       years in temperate forests. That's the speed of the destruction that we are having. Now  Brazil is an important piece of this puzzle. We have the second largest forest in the world  just after Russia. It means    percent of all the world's forests are in Brazil  most of that in the Amazon. It's the largest piece of forest we have. It's a very big  large area. You can see that you could fit many of the European countries there. We still have    percent of the forest cover. That's the good news. But we lost    percent in just    years. So if you go with that speed  very soon  we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the Amazon that regulates our climate. Deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end of the '  s and the beginning of the     s. Twenty seven thousand square kilometers in one year. This is  .  million hectares. It's almost like half of Costa Rica every year. So at this moment    this is               I happened to be coming to work in the government. And together with other teammates in the National Forest Department  we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation  and make a plan to combat that at a national level  involving the local governments  the civil society  business  local communities  in an effort that could tackle those causes. So we came up with this plan with     actions in different areas. Now I will go through all of them one by one    no  just giving some examples of what we had done in the next few years. So the first thing  we set up a system with the national space agency that could actually see where deforestation is happening  almost in real time. So now in Brazil   we have this system  DETER  where every month  or every two months  we get information on where deforestation is happening so we can actually act when it's happening. And all the information is fully transparent so others can replicate that in independent systems. This allows us  among other things  to apprehend  .  million cubic meters of logs that were illegally taken. Part of that we saw and sell  and all the revenue becomes a fund that now funds conservation projects of local communities as an endowment fund. This also allows us to make a big operation to seize corruption and illegal activities that ended up having     people in prison  including a lot of public servants. Then we made the connection that areas that have been doing illegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance. So we cut this through the bank system and then linked this to the end users. So supermarkets  the slaughterhouses  and so on that buy products from illegal clear cut areas  they also can be liable for the deforestation. So making all these connections to help to push the problem down. And also we work a lot on land tenure issues. It's very important for conflicts. Fifty million hectares of protected areas were created  which is an area the size of Spain. And of those  eight million were indigenous lands. Now we start to see results. So in the last    years  deforestation came down in Brazil    percent. So if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade  we saved  .  million hectares  which is the size of Austria. But more importantly  it avoided the emission of three billion tons of CO  in the atmosphere. This is by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  until today  as a positive action. One may think that when you do these kinds of actions to decrease  to push down deforestation  you will have an economic impact because you will not have economic activity or something like that. But it's interesting to know that it's quite the opposite. In fact  in the period when we have the deepest decline of deforestation  the economy grew  on average  double from the previous decade  when deforestation was actually going up. So it's a good lesson for us. Maybe this is completely disconnected  as we just learned by having deforestation come down. Now this is all good news  and it's quite an achievement  and we obviously should be very proud about that. But it's not even close to sufficient. In fact  if you think about the deforestation in the Amazon in       that was over half a million hectares  which means that every minute  an area the size of two soccer fields is being cut in the Amazon last year  just last year. If we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in Brazil  we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world. It's more or less like we are forest heroes  but still deforestation champions. So we can't be satisfied  not even close to satisfied. So the next step  I think  is to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in Brazil and to have that as a goal for     . That's our next step. Now I've always been interested in the relationship between climate change and forests. First  because    percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation  so it's a big part of the problem. But also  forests can be a big part of the solution since that's the best way we know to sink  capture and store carbon. Now  there is another relationship of climate and forests that really stuck me in      and made me change my career from forests to working with climate change. I went to visit Canada  in British Columbia  together with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a kind of alliance of them  like Canada  Russia  India  China  U.S. And when we were there we learned about this pine beetle that is literally eating the forests in Canada. What we see here  those brown trees  these are really dead trees. They are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the beetle. What happens is that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter. For many years now  they don't have the sufficient cold weather to actually control the population of this beetle. And it became a disease that is really killing billions of trees. So I came back with this notion that the forest is actually one of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change. So I was thinking  if I succeed in working with all my colleagues to actually help to stop deforestation  maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change by floods  heat  fires and so on. So I decided to leave the forest service and start to work directly on climate change  find a way to think and understand the challenge  and go from there. Now  the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward. The goal is very clear. We want to limit the increase of the average temperature of the planet to two degrees. There are several reasons for that. I will not get into that now. But in order to get to this limit of two degrees  which is possible for us to survive  the IPCC  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  defines that we have a budget of emissions of       billion tons of CO  from now until the end of the century. So if we divide this by the number of years  what we have is an average budget of    billion tons of CO  per year. Now what is one ton of CO   It's more or less what one small car  running    kilometers a day  will emit in one year. Or it's one flight  one way  from S o Paulo to Johannesburg or to London  one way. Two ways  two tons. So    billion tons is twice that. Now the emissions today are    billion tons  and it's growing. It's growing and maybe it will be    by     . Now we need to go down to    by     . And while this happens  the population will grow from seven to nine billion people  the economy will grow from    trillion dollars in      to     trillion dollars. And so what we need to do is to be much more efficient in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita per person  per year  into something like one. You have to choose. You take the airplane or you have a car. So the question is  can we make it  And that's the exactly the same question I got when I was developing a plan to combat deforestation. It's such a big problem  so complex. Can we really do it  I think so. Think of this  Deforestation means    percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil in the last decade. Now it's a little bit less than    percent. In the world     percent is energy. So if we can tackle directly the energy  the same way we could tackle deforestation  maybe we can have a chance. So there are five things that I think we should do. First  we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions. We don't need to clear cut all the forests to actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy. That's what we proved when we decreased deforestation and the economy continued to grow. Same thing could happen in the energy sector. Second  we have to move the incentives to the right place. Today      billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels. Why don't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy  Third  we need to measure and make it transparent where  when and who is emitting greenhouse gases so we can have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities. Fourth  we need to leapfrog the routes of development  which means  you don't need to go to the landline telephone before you get to the mobile phones. Same way we don't need to go to fossil fuels to the one billion people who don't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy. And fifth and last  we need to share responsibility between governments  business and civil society. There is work to do for everybody  and we need to have everybody on board. So to finalize  I think the future is not like a fate that you have to just go as business as usual goes. We need to have the courage to actually change the route  invest in something new  think that we can actually change the route. I think we are doing this with deforestation in Brazil  and I hope we can do it also with climate change in the world. Thank you. When you grow up in a developing country like India  as I did  you instantly learn to get more value from limited resources and find creative ways to reuse what you already have. Take Mansukh Prajapati  a potter in India. He has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity. He can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days. That's a cool invention  literally. In Africa  if you run out of your cell phone battery  don't panic. You will find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your  cell phone using bicycles. And since we are in South America  let's go to Lima in Peru  a region with high humidity that receives only one inch of rainfall each year. An engineering college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water  generating over    liters of water every day. The Peruvians are amazing. They can literally create water out of thin air. For the past seven years  I have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in India  China  Africa and South America  and they keep amazing me. Many of them did not go to school. They don't invent stuff in big R D labs. The street is the lab. Why do they do that  Because they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted  like capital and energy  and basic services like healthcare and education are also scarce in those regions. When external resources are scarce  you have to go within yourself to tap the most abundant resource  human ingenuity  and use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources. In India  we call it Jugaad. Jugaad is a Hindi word that means an improvised fix  a clever solution born in adversity. Jugaad solutions are not sophisticated or perfect  but they create more value at lower cost. For me  the entrepreneurs who will create Jugaad solutions are like alchemists. They can magically transform adversity into opportunity  and turn something of less value into something of high value. In other words  they mastered the art of doing more with less  which is the essence of frugal innovation. Frugal innovation is the ability  to create more economic and social value using fewer resources. Frugal innovation is not about making do  it's about making things better. Now I want to show you how  across emerging markets  entrepreneurs and companies are adopting  frugal innovation on a larger scale to cost effectively deliver healthcare and energy to billions of people who may have little income but very high aspirations. Let's first go to China  where the country's largest I.T. service provider  Neusoft  has developed a telemedicine solution to help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients in Chinese villages. This solution is based on simple to use medical devices that less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics. China desperately needs these frugal medical solutions because by      it will be home to over half a billion senior citizens. Now let's go to Kenya  a country where half the population uses M Pesa  a mobile payment solution. This is a great solution for the African continent because    percent of Africans don't have a bank account  but what is exciting is that M Pesa is now becoming the source of other disruptive business models in sectors like energy. Take M KOPA  the home solar solution that comes literally in a box that has a solar rooftop panel  three LED lights  a solar radio  and a cell phone charger. The whole kit  though  costs     dollars  which is too expensive for most Kenyans  and this is where mobile telephony can make the solution more affordable. Today  you can buy this kit by making an initial deposit of just    dollars  and then pay off the rest by making a daily micro payment of    cents using your mobile phone. Once you've made     micro payments  the system is unlocked  and you own the product and you start  receiving clean  free electricity. This is an amazing solution for Kenya  where    percent of people live off the grid. This shows that with frugal innovation what matters is that you take what is most abundant  mobile connectivity  to deal with what is scarce  which is energy. With frugal innovation  the global South is actually catching up and in some cases  even leap frogging the North. Instead of building expensive hospitals  China is using telemedicine to cost effectively treat millions of patients  and Africa  instead of building banks and electricity grids  is going straight to mobile payments and distributed clean energy. Frugal innovation is diametrically opposed to the way we innovate in the North. I live in Silicon Valley  where we keep chasing the next big technology thing. Think of the iPhone       then     . Companies in the West spend billions of dollars investing in R D  and use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products  to differentiate their brands from competition  and they charge customers more money for new features. So the conventional business model  in the West is more for more. But sadly  this more for more model is running out of gas  for three reasons  First  a big portion of customers in the West because of the diminishing purchasing power  can no longer afford these expensive products. Second  we are running out of natural water and oil. In California  where I live  water scarcity is becoming a big problem. And third  most importantly  because of the growing income disparity between the rich  and the middle class in the West  there is a big disconnect between existing products and services and basic needs of customers. Do you know that today  there are over    million Americans today who are underbanked  because existing banking services are not designed to address their basic needs. The prolonged economic crisis in the West is making people think that they are about to lose the high standard of living and face deprivation. I believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West is if we learn to do more with less. The good news is  that's starting to happen. Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers. Let me give you two examples. When I first saw this building  I told myself it's some kind of postmodern house. Actually  it's a small manufacturing plant set up by Grameen Danone  a joint venture between  Grameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus and the food multinational Danone to make high quality yogurt in Bangladesh. This factory is    percent the size of existing Danone factories and cost much less to build. I guess you can call it a low fat factory. Now this factory  unlike Western factories that are highly automated  relies a lot on manual processes in order  to generate jobs for local communities. Danone was so inspired by this model that combines economic efficiency and social sustainability  they are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well. Now  when you see this example  you might be thinking   Well  frugal innovation is low tech.  Actually  no. Frugal innovation is also about making high tech more affordable and more accessible to more people. Let me give you an example. In China  the R D engineers of Siemens Healthcare have designed a C.T. scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers  like nurses and technicians. This device can scan more patients on a daily basis  and yet consumes less energy  which is great for hospitals  but it's also great for patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by    percent and radiation dosage by up to    percent. This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market  but now it's selling like hotcakes in the U.S. and Europe  where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost. But the frugal innovation revolution in the West is actually led by creative entrepreneurs who are coming up with amazing solutions to address basic needs in the U.S. and Europe. Let me quickly give you three examples of startups that personally inspire me. The first one happens to be launched by my neighbor in Silicon Valley. It's called gThrive. They make these wireless sensors designed like plastic rulers that farmers can stick in different parts of the field and start collecting detailed information like soil conditions. This dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy while improving quality of the products and the yields  which is a great solution for California  which faces major water shortage. It pays for itself within one year. Second example is Be Bound  also in Silicon Valley  that enables you to connect to the Internet even in no bandwidth areas where there's no wi fi or  G or  G. How do they do that  They simply use SMS  a basic technology  but that happens to be the most reliable and most widely available around the world. Three billion people today with  cell phones can't access the Internet. This solution can connect them to the Internet in a frugal way. And in France  there is a startup calle Compte Nickel  which is revolutionizing the banking sector. It allows thousands of people to walk into a Mom and Pop store and in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products  an international bank account number and an international debit card. They charge a flat annual  maintenance fee of just    Euros. That means you can do all banking transactions    send and receive money  pay with your debit card    all with no additional charge. This is what I call low cost banking without the bank. Amazingly     percent of the customers using this service are the middle class French who can't afford high banking fees. Now  I talked about frugal innovation  initially pioneered in the South  now being adopted in the North. Ultimately  we would like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity. The exciting news is that's starting to happen. Let's go to Nairobi to find that out. Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams. When I first saw them  I thought   Holy cow.  Literally  because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in Nairobi. To ease the situation  the engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya are piloting a solution called Megaffic  which initially was designed by the Japanese engineers. Unlike in the West  Megaffic doesn't rely on roadside sensors  which are very expensive to install in Nairobi. Instead they process images  traffic data  collected from a small number of low resolution webcams in Nairobi streets  and then they use analytic software to predict congestion points  and they can SMS drivers alternate routes to take. Granted  Megaffic is not as sexy as self driving cars  but it promises to take Nairobi drivers from point A to point B at least    percent faster. And earlier this year  UCLA Health launched its Global Lab for Innovation  which seeks to identify frugal healthcare  solutions anywhere in the world that will be at least    percent cheaper than existing solutions in the U.S. and yet more effective. It also tries to bring together innovators from North and South to cocreate affordable healthcare solutions for all of humanity. I gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world  but the question is  how do you go about adopting frugal innovation  Well  I gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world that I want to share with you that you can apply in your own organization to do more with less. The first principle is  Keep it simple. Don't create solutions to impress customers. Make them easy enough to use and widely accessible  like the C.T. scanner we saw in China. Second principle   Do not reinvent the wheel. Try to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available  like using mobile telephony to offer clean energy or Mom and Pop stores to offer banking services. Third principle is  Think and act horizontally. Companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses  but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity  you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units  like Grameen Bank has shown. The South pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity. The North is now learning to do more and better with less as it faces resource constraints. As an Indian born French national who lives in the United States  my hope is that we transcend this artificial North South divide so that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world to cocreate frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world  while preserving our precious planet. Thank you very much. Let's go south. All of you are actually going south. This is the direction of south  this way  and if you go       kilometers out of the back of this room  you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on Earth  the Pole itself. Now  I am not an explorer. I'm not an environmentalist. I'm actually just a survivor  and these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous. They are the ice melt of the South and North Poles. And ladies and gentlemen  we need to listen to what these places are telling us  and if we don't  we will end up with our own survival situation here on planet Earth. I have faced head on these places  and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing that's ever happened to me. Antarctica is such a hopeful place. It is protected by  the Antarctic Treaty  signed in     . In       a    year agreement was entered into that stops any exploitation in Antarctica  and this agreement could be altered  changed  modified  or even abandoned starting in the year     . Ladies and gentlemen  people already far up north from here in the Arctic are already taking advantage of this ice melt  taking out resources from areas already that have been covered in ice for the last                         years. Can they not join the dots and think   Why is the ice actually melting   This is such an amazing place  the Antarctic  and I have worked hard for the last    years on this mission to make sure that what's happening up here in the North does never happen   cannot happen in the South. Where did this all begin  It began for me at the age of   . Check out that haircut.  It's a bit odd.  Laughter  And at the age of      I was inspired by the real explorers to want to try to be the first to walk to both Poles. I found it incredibly inspiring that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls  at parties when I was at university. That was a bit more inspiring. And after years  seven years of fundraising  seven years of being told no  seven years of being told by my family to seek counseling and psychiatric help  eventually three of us found ourselves marching to the South Geographic Pole on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on Earth in history. In this photograph  we are standing in an area the size of the United States of America  and we're on our own. We have no radio  communications  no backup. Beneath our feet     percent of all the world's ice     percent of all the world's fresh water. We're standing on it. This is the power of Antarctica. On this journey  we faced the danger of crevasses  intense cold  so cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing  your teeth can crack  water can freeze in your eyes. Let's just say it's a bit chilly.  Laughter  And after    desperate days  we arrive at the South Pole. We had done it. But something happened to me on that    day journey in      that brought me here  and it hurt. My eyes changed color in    days through damage. Our faces blistered out. The skin ripped off and we wondered why. And when we got home  we were told by NASA that a hole in the ozone had been discovered above the South Pole  and we'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered. Ultraviolet rays down  hit the ice  bounced back  fried out the eyes  ripped off our faces. It was a bit of a shock     Laughter     and it started me thinking. In       we now head north. Sixty days  every step away from the safety of land across a frozen ocean. It was desperately cold again. Here's me coming in from washing naked at     Celsius. And if anybody ever says to you   I am cold      Laughter     if they look like this   they are cold  definitely. And       kilometers away from the safety of land  disaster strikes. The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history  and we're       kilometers from safety. The ice is crashing around us  grinding  and I'm thinking   Are we going to die   But something clicked in my head on this day  as I realized we  as a world  are in a survival situation  and that feeling has never gone away for    long years. Back then  we had to march or die. And we're not some TV survivor program. When things go wrong for us  it's life or death  and our brave African American Daryl  who would become the first American to walk to the North Pole  his heel dropped off  from frostbite     klicks out. He must keep going  he does  and after    days on the ice  we stood at the North Pole. We had done it. Yes  I became the first person in history stupid enough to walk to both Poles  but it was our success. And sadly  on return home  it was not all fun. I became very low. To succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen. I was empty  lonely  financially destroyed. I was without hope  but hope came in the form of the great Jacques Cousteau  and he inspired me to take on  the      mission. Being Jacques  he gave me clear instructions  Engage the world leaders  talk to industry and business  and above all  Rob  inspire young people  because they will choose the future of the preservation of Antarctica. For the world leaders  we've been to every world Earth Summit  all three of them  with our brave yacht        twice to Rio  once in '    once in       and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg  we made the longest overland voyage ever made with a yacht         kilometers around the whole of Southern Africa doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person about      and about their environment. For the last    years  we have taken over       people  people from industry and business  women and men from companies  students from all over the world  down to Antarctica  and during those missions  we've managed to pull out over       tons of twisted metal left in Antarctica. That took eight years  and I'm so proud of it because we recycled all of it  back here in South America. I have been inspired ever since I could walk to recycle by my mum. Here she is  and my mum    my mum is still recycling  and as she is in her    th year  isn't that fantastic  And when    I love my mum. But when Mum was born  the population of our planet was only  .  billion people  and talking in terms of billions  we have taken young people from industry and business from India  from China. These are game changing nations  and will be hugely important in the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic. Unbelievably  we've engaged and inspired women to come from the Middle East  often for the first time they've  represented their nations in Antarctica. Fantastic people  so inspired. To look after Antarctica  you've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place  form a relationship  form a bond  form some love. It is such a privilege to go to Antarctica  I can't tell you. I feel so lucky  and I've been    times in my life  and all those people who come with us return home as great champions  not only for Antarctica  but for local issues back in their own nations. Let's go back to where we began  the ice melt of the North and South Poles. And it's not good news. NASA informed us six months ago that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf is now disintegrating. Huge areas of ice    look how big Antarctica is even compared to here    Huge areas of ice  are breaking off from Antarctica  the size of small nations. And NASA have calculated that the sea level will rise  it is definite  by one meter in the next     years  the same time that my mum has been on planet Earth. It's going to happen  and I've realized that  the preservation of Antarctica and our survival here on Earth are linked. And there is a very simple solution. If we are using more renewable energy in the real world  if we are being more efficient with the energy here  running our energy mix in a cleaner way  there will be no financial reason to go and exploit Antarctica. It won't make financial sense  and if we manage our energy better  we also may be able to slow down  maybe even stop  this great ice melt that threatens us. It's a big challenge  and what is our response to it  We've got to go back one last time  and at the end of next year  we will go back to the South Geographic Pole  where we arrived    years ago on foot  and retrace our steps of       kilometers  but this time only using renewable energy to survive. We will walk across those icecaps  which far down below are melting  hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue. This is my son  Barney. He is coming with me. He is committed to walking side by side with his father  and what he will do is to translate these messages and inspire these messages to the minds of future young leaders. I'm extremely proud of him. Good on him  Barney. Ladies and gentlemen   a survivor    and I'm good    a survivor sees a problem and doesn't go   Whatever.  A survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem before it becomes a threat. We have    years to preserve the Antarctic. We all own it. We all have responsibility. The fact that nobody owns it  maybe means that we can succeed. Antarctica is a moral line in the snow  and on one side of that line we should fight  fight hard for this one beautiful  pristine place left alone on Earth. I know it's possible. We are going to do it. And I'll leave you with these words from Goethe. I've tried to live by them.  If you can do  or dream you can  begin it now  for boldness has genius  power and magic in it.  Good luck to you all. Thank you very much. We can cut violent deaths around the world by    percent in the next three decades. All we have to do is drop killing by  .  percent a year  and we'll hit that target. You don't believe me  Well  the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world seem to think we can  and so do I  but only if we focus on our cities  especially the most fragile ones. You see  I've been thinking about this a lot. For the last    years  I've been working in countries and cities ripped apart by conflict  violence  terrorism  or some insidious combination of all. I've tracked gun smugglers from Russia to Somalia  I've worked with warlords in Afghanistan and the Congo  I've counted cadavers in Colombia  in  Haiti  in Sri Lanka  in Papua New Guinea. You don't need to be on the front line  though  to get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control  right  There's this feeling that international instability is the new normal. But I want you to take a closer look  and I think you'll see that the geography of violence is changing  because it's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime as our cities  Aleppo  Bamako  Caracas   Erbil  Mosul  Tripoli  Salvador. Violence is migrating to the metropole. And maybe this is to be expected  right  After all  most people today  they live in cities  not the countryside. Just     cities  including    megacities  account for two thirds of global GDP. But when it comes to cities  the conversation is dominated by the North  that is  North America  Western Europe  Australia and Japan  where violence is  actually at historic lows. As a result  city enthusiasts  they talk about the triumph of the city  of the creative classes  and the mayors that will rule the world. Now  I hope that mayors do one day rule the world  but  you know  the fact is  we don't hear any conversation  really  about what is happening in the South. And by South  I mean Latin America  Africa  Asia  where violence in some cases is accelerating  where infrastructure is overstretched  and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality. Now  some diplomats and development experts and specialists  they talk about    to    fragile states that will shape security in the   st century. I think it's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder. That's because warfare and humanitarian action are going to be concentrated in our cities  and the fight for development  whether you define that as eradicating poverty  universal healthcare  beating back climate change  will be won or lost in the shantytowns  slums and favelas of our cities. I want to talk to you about four megarisks that I think will define fragility in our time  and if we can get to grips with these  I think we can do something with that lethal violence problem. So let me start with some good news. Fact is  we're living in the most peaceful moment in human history. Steven Pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict is actually at an all time low. Now  Gaza  Syria  Sudan  Ukraine  as ghastly as these conflicts are  and they are horrific  they represent a relatively small blip upwards in a    year long secular decline. What's more  we're seeing a dramatic reduction in homicide. Manuel Eisner and others have shown that for centuries  we've seen this incredible drop in murder  especially in the West. Most Northern cities today are     times safer than they were just     years ago. These two facts    the decline in armed  conflict and the decline in murder    are amongst the most extraordinary  if unheralded  accomplishments of human history  and we should be really excited  right  Well  yeah  we should. There's just one problem  These two scourges are still with us. You see          people    men  women  boys and girls    die violently every single year. Research I've been doing with Keith Krause and others has shown that between        and        people are dying in war zones violently. The rest  almost         people  are dying outside of conflict zones. In other words     times more people are dying outside of war than inside war. What's more  violence is moving south  to Latin America and the Caribbean  to parts of Central and Southern Africa  and to bits of the Middle East and Central Asia. Forty of the    most dangerous  cities in the world are right here in Latin America     in Brazil  and the most dangerous of all  it's  San Pedro Sula  Honduras' second city  with a staggering homicide rate of     murders per         people. That's    times the global average. Now  if violence is re concentrating geographically  it's also being reconfigured to the world's new topography  because when it comes to cities  the world ain't flat  like Thomas Friedman likes to say. It's spiky. The dominance of the city as the primary mode of urban living is one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history  and it all happened so fast. You all know the figures  right  There's  .  billion people in the world today  there will be  .  billion by     . But consider this one fact  In the     s  one in    people lived in cities  today it's one in two  and tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there. And this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable. The vast majority     percent  will be happening in the South  in cities of the South. So urban geographers and demographers  they tell us that it's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence  no. Tokyo  with    million people  is one of the largest  and some might say safest  urban metropolises in the world. No  it's the speed of urbanization that matters. I call this turbo urbanization  and it's  one of the key drivers of fragility. When you think about the incredible expansion of these cities  and you think about turbo urbanization  think about Karachi. Karachi was about         people in       a hustling  bustling city. Today  it's    million people  and apart from accounting for three quarters of Pakistan's GDP  it's also one of the most violent cities in South Asia. Dhaka  Lagos  Kinshasa  these cities are now    times larger than they were in the     s. Now take a look at New York. The Big Apple  it took     years to get to eight million people. S o Paulo  Mexico City  took    to reach that same interval. Now  what do these medium  large  mega   and hypercities look like  What is their profile  Well  for one thing  they're young. What we're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge. Now  this is actually a good news story. It's a function of reductions in child mortality rates. But the youth bulge is something we've got to watch. What it basically means is the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities is much larger than those living  in our healthier and wealthier ones. In some fragile cities     percent of the population is under the age of   . Think about that  Three in four people are under   . It's like Palo Alto on steroids. Now  if you look at Mogadishu for example  in Mogadishu the mean age is    years old. Ditto for Dhaka  Dili and Kabul. And Tokyo  It's   . Same for most Western European cities. Now  it's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence. That's one factor among many  but youthfulness combined with unemployment  lack of education  and    this is the kicker     being male  is a deadly proposition. They're statistically correlated  all those risk factors  with youth  and they tend to relate to increases in violence. Now  for those of you who are parents of teenage sons  you know what I'm talking about  right  Just imagine your boy without any structure with those unruly friends of his  out there cavorting about. Now  take away the parents  take away the education  limit the education possibilities  sprinkle in a little bit of drugs  alcohol and guns  and sit back and watch the fireworks. The implications are disconcerting. Right here in Brazil  the life expectancy is   .  years. If you live in Rio  I'm sorry  shave off two right there. But if you're young  you're uneducated  you lack employment  you're black  and you're male  your life expectancy drops to less than    years old. There's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers in this country. Okay  so it's not all doom and gloom in our cities. After all  cities are hubs of innovation  dynamism  prosperity   excitement  connectivity. They're where the smart people gather. And those young people I just mentioned  they're more digitally savvy and tech aware than ever before. And this explosion  the Internet  and mobile technology  means that the digital divide separating the North and the South between countries and within them  is shrinking. But as we've heard so many times  these new technologies are dual edged  right  Take the case of law enforcement. Police around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data to anticipate crime. Some cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens. The future crime scenario  it's here today  and we've got to be careful. We have to manage the issues of the public safety against rights to individual privacy. But it's not just the cops who are innovating. We've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups who are engaging in local  and global collective action  and this is leading to digital protest and real revolution. But most worrying of all are criminal gangs who are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace. In Ciudad Ju rez in Mexico  where I've been working  groups like the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel are hijacking social media. They're using it to recruit  to sell their products  to coerce  to intimidate and to kill. Violence is going virtual. So this is just a partial sketch of a fast moving and dynamic and complex situation. I mean  there are many other megarisks that are going to define fragility in our time  not least income inequality  poverty  climate change  impunity. But we're facing a stark dilemma where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth and others are going to stumble and pull it backwards. If we're going to change course  we need to start a conversation. We can't only focus on those cities that work  the Singapores  the Kuala Lumpurs  the Dubais  the Shanghais. We've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation. One way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones  kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices  of what works and what doesn't. A wonderful example of this is coming from El Salvador and Los Angeles  where the mayors in San Salvador and Los Angeles are collaborating on getting ex gang members to work with current gang members  offering tutoring  education  and in the process are helping incubate cease fires and truces  and we've seen homicide rates go down in San Salvador  once the world's most violent city  by    percent. We can also focus  on hot cities  but also hot spots. Place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities. Did you know that between one and two percent of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to    percent of violent crime  Take the case of S o Paulo  where I've been working. It's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest  and it did this by doubling down on information collection  hot spot mapping  and police reform  and in the process  it dropped homicide by    percent in just over    years. We also got to focus on those hot people. It's tragic  but being young  unemployed  uneducated  male  increases the risks of being killed and killing. We have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children  our youngest children  and valorize them  not stigmatize them. There's wonderful work that's happening that I've been involved with in Kingston  Jamaica and right here in Rio  which is putting education  employment  recreation up front for these high risk groups  and as a result  we're seeing violence going down in their communities. We've also got to make our cities safer  more inclusive  and livable for all. The fact is  social cohesion matters. Mobility matters in our cities. We've got to get away from this model of segregation  exclusion  and cities with walls. My favorite example of how to do this comes from Medell n. When I lived in Colombia in the late     s  Medell n was the murder capital  of the world  but it changed course  and it did this by deliberately investing in its low income and most violent areas and integrating them with the middle class ones through a network of cable cars  of public transport  and first class infrastructure  and in the process  it dropped homicide by    percent in just under two decades. And finally  there's technology. Technology has enormous promise but also peril. We've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation  and much of it coming from this room  The police are engaging  in predictive analytics. Citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions. Even my own group is involved in developing applications to provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens. But we need to be careful. If I have one single message for you  it's this  There is nothing inevitable about lethal violence  and we can make our cities safer. Folks  we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime. So I have just one question  What are we waiting for  Thank you. It's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back. The first time I visited the prison  I was not surprised by the noise of the padlocks  or the closing doors  or the cell bars  or by any of the things I had imagined. Maybe because the prison is in a quite open space. You can see the sky. Seagulls fly overhead  and you feel like you're next to the sea  that you're really close to the beach. But in fact  the gulls are looking for food in the dump near the prison. I went farther inside and I suddenly saw inmates moving across the corridors. Then it was as if I stepped back and thought that I could have very well been one of them. If I had another story  another context  different luck. Because nobody   nobody   can choose where they're born. In       I was invited to join a project that San Mart n National University conducted at the Unit    penitentiary  to coordinate a writing workshop. The prison service ceded some land at the end of the prison  which is where they constructed the University Center building. The first time I met with the prisoners  I asked them why they were asking for a writing workshop and they told me they wanted  to put on paper all that they couldn't say and do. Right then I decided that I wanted poetry to enter the prison. So I said to them why don't we work with poetry  if they knew what poetry was. But nobody had a clue what poetry really was. They also suggested to me that the workshop should be not just for the inmates taking university classes   but for all the inmates. And so I said that to start this workshop  I needed to find a tool that we all had in common. That tool was language. We had language  we had the workshop. We could have poetry. But what I hadn't considered was that inequality exists in prison  too. Many of the prisoners hadn't even completed grammar school. Many couldn't use cursive  could barely print. They didn't write fluently  either. So we started looking for short poems. Very short  but very powerful. And we started to read  and we'd read one author  then another author  and by reading such short poems  they all began to realize that what the poetic language did was to break a certain logic  and create another system. Breaking the logic of language also breaks the logic of the system under which they've learned to respond. So a new system appeared  new rules that made them understand very quickly    very quickly   that with poetic language they would be able to say absolutely whatever they wanted. It's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back. And they have plenty of hell. Plenty of hell. One of them once said   In prison you never sleep. You can never sleep in jail. You can never close your eyelids.  And so  like I m doing now  I gave them a moment of silence  then said   That's what poetry is  you guys. It's in this prison universe that you have all around you. Everything you say about how you never sleep  it exudes fear. All the things that go unwritten    all of that is poetry.  So we started appropriating that hell  we plunged ourselves  headfirst  into the seventh circle. And in that seventh circle of hell  our very own  beloved circle  they learned that they could make the walls invisible  that they could make the windows yell  and that we could hide inside the shadows. When the first year of the workshop had ended  we organized a little closing party  like you do when a job is done with so much love  and you want to celebrate with a party. We called family  friends   the university authorities. The only thing the inmates had to do was read a poem  and receive their diplomas and applause. That was our simple party. The only thing I want to leave you with is the moment in which those men  some of them just huge when standing next to me  or the young boys   so young  but with an enormous pride  held their papers and trembled like little kids and sweated  and read their poems with their voices completely broken. That moment made me think a lot that for most of them  it was surely the very first time that someone applauded them for something they had done. In prison there are things that can't be done. In prison  you can't dream. In prison  you can't cry. There are words that are virtually forbidden  like the word  time   the word  future   the word  wish . But we dared to dream  and to dream a lot. We decided that they were going to write a book. Not only did they write a book  but they also bound it themselves. That was at the end of     . Then  we doubled the bet and wrote another book. And we bound that one  too. That was a short time ago  at the end of last year. What I see week after week  is how they're turning into different people  how they're being transformed. How words are empowering them with a dignity they had never known  that they couldn't even imagine. They had no idea such dignity could come from them. At the workshop  in that beloved hell we share  we all give something. We open our hands and hearts and give what we have  what we can. All of us  all of us equally. And so you feel that at least in a small way you're repairing that huge social fracture which makes it so that for many of them  prison is their only destination. I remember a verse by a tremendous poet  a great poet  from our Unit    workshop  Nicol s Dorado   I will need an infinite thread to sew up this huge wound.  Poetry does that  it sews up the wounds of exclusion. It opens doors.  Poetry works as a mirror. It creates a mirror  which is the poem. They recognize themselves  they look at themselves in the poem and write from who they are  and are from what they write. In order to write  they need to appropriate the moment of writing which is a moment of extraordinary freedom. They have to get into their heads  search for that bit of freedom that can never be taken away when they write and that is also useful to realize that freedom is possible even inside a prison  and that the only bars we have in our wonderful space is the word  bars   and that all of us in our hell burn with happiness when we light the wick of the word. I told you a lot about the prison  a lot about what I experience every week  and how I enjoy it and transform myself with the inmates. But you don't know how much I'd like it if you could feel  live  experience  even for a few seconds  what I enjoy every week and what makes me who I am. Mart n Bustamante   The heart chews tears of time  blinded by that light  it hides the speed of existence where the images go rowing by. It fights  it hangs on. The heart cracks under sad gazes  rides on storms that spread fire  lifts chests lowered by shame  knows that it's not just reading and going on  it also wishes to see the infinite blue. The heart sits down to think about things  fights to avoid being ordinary  tries to love without hurting  breathes the sun  giving courage to itself  surrenders  travels toward reason. The heart fights among the swamps  skirts the edge of the underworld  falls exhausted  but won't give in to what's easy  while irregular steps of intoxication wake up  wake the stillness. I'm Mart n Bustamante  I'm a prisoner in Unit    of San Mart n  today is my day of temporary release. And for me  poetry and literature have changed my life. Thank you very much  Cristina Domenech  Thank you  So we humans have an extraordinary potential for goodness  but also an immense power to do harm. Any tool can be used to build or to destroy. That all depends on our motivation. Therefore  it is all the more important to foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one. So now we indeed are facing  many challenges in our times. Those could be personal challenges. Our own mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy. There's also societal challenges  poverty in the midst of plenty  inequalities  conflict  injustice. And then there are the new challenges  which we don't expect. Ten thousand years ago  there were about five million human beings on Earth. Whatever they could do  the Earth's resilience  would soon heal human activities. After the Industrial and Technological Revolutions  that's not the same anymore. We are now the major agent of impact on our Earth. We enter the Anthropocene  the era of human beings. So in a way  if we were to say we need to continue this endless growth  endless use of material resources  it's like if this man was saying    and I heard a former head of state  I won't mention who  saying     Five years ago  we were at the edge of the precipice. Today we made a big step forward.  So this edge is the same that has been defined by scientists as the planetary boundaries. And within those boundaries  they can carry a number of factors. We can still prosper  humanity can still prosper for         years if we keep the same stability of climate as in the Holocene for the last        years. But this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity  growing qualitatively  not quantitatively. So in       as you can see  we were well within the limits of safety. Now  in      came the great acceleration. Now hold your breath  not too long  to imagine what comes next. Now we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries. Just to take biodiversity   at the current rate  by          percent of all species  on Earth will have disappeared. Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge  that's not going to be reversible. So here I am sitting in front of a       meter high          foot glacier in Bhutan. At the Third Pole        glaciers are melting fast  faster than the Arctic. So what can we do in that situation  Well  however complex politically  economically  scientifically the question of the environment is  it simply boils down to a question of altruism versus selfishness. I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency. Groucho Marx said   Why should I care about future generations  What have they ever done for me   Unfortunately  I heard the billionaire Steve Forbes  on Fox News  saying exactly  the same thing  but seriously. He was told about the rise of the ocean  and he said   I find it absurd to change my behavior today for something that will happen  in a hundred years.  So if you don't care for future generations  just go for it. So one of the main challenges of our times is to reconcile three time scales  the short term of the economy  the ups and downs of the stock market  the end of the year accounts  the midterm of the quality of life    what is the quality every moment of our  life  over    years and    years     and the long term of the environment. When the environmentalists speak with economists  it's like a schizophrenic dialogue  completely incoherent. They don't speak the same language. Now  for the last    years  I went around the world meeting economists  scientists  neuroscientists  environmentalists  philosophers  thinkers  in the Himalayas  all over the place. It seems to me  there's only one concept that can reconcile those three time scales. It is simply having more consideration for others. If you have more consideration for others  you will have a caring economics  where finance is at the service of society and not society at the service of finance. You will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with. If you have more consideration for others  you will make sure that you remedy inequality  that you bring some kind  of well being within society  in education  at the workplace. Otherwise  a nation that is the most powerful and the richest but everyone is miserable  what's the point  And if you have more consideration for others  you are not going to ransack that planet that we have and at the current rate  we don't have three planets to continue that way. So the question is  okay  altruism is the answer  it's not just a novel ideal  but can it be a real  pragmatic solution  And first of all  does it exist  true altruism  or are we so selfish  So some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish. But are we really all just like rascals  That's good news  isn't it  Many philosophers   like Hobbes  have said so. But not everyone looks like a rascal. Or is man a wolf for man  But this guy doesn't seem too bad. He's one of my friends in Tibet. He's very kind. So now  we love cooperation. There's no better joy  than working together  is there  And then not only humans. Then  of course  there's the struggle for life  the survival of the fittest  social Darwinism. But in evolution  cooperation    though competition exists  of course    cooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity. We are super cooperators  and we should even go further. So now  on top of that  the quality of human relationships. The OECD did a survey among    factors  including income  everything. The first one that people said  that's the main thing for my happiness  is quality of social relationships. Not only in humans. And look at those great grandmothers. So now  this idea  that if we go deep within  we are irredeemably selfish  this is armchair science. There is not a single sociological study  psychological study  that's ever shown that. Rather  the opposite. My friend  Daniel Batson   spent a whole life putting people in the lab in very complex situations. And of course we are sometimes selfish  and some people more than others. But he found that systematically  no matter what  there's a significant number of people who do behave altruistically  no matter what. If you see someone deeply wounded  great suffering  you might just help out of empathic distress    you can't stand it  so it's better to help than to keep on looking at that person. So we tested all that  and in the end   he said  clearly people can be altruistic. So that's good news. And even further  we should look at the banality of goodness. Now look at here. When we come out  we aren't  going to say   That's so nice. There was no fistfight while this mob  was thinking about altruism.  No  that's expected  isn't it  If there was a fistfight  we would speak of that for months. So the banality of goodness is something that doesn't attract your attention  but it exists. Now  look at this. So some psychologists said  when I tell them I run     humanitarian  projects in the Himalayas that give me so much joy  they said   Oh  I see  you work for the warm glow. That is not altruistic. You just feel good.  You think this guy  when he jumped in front of the train  he thought   I'm going to feel so good when this is over   But that's not the end of it. They say  well  but when you interviewed him  he said   I had no choice. I had to jump  of course.  He has no choice. Automatic behavior. It's neither selfish nor altruistic. No choice  Well of course  this guy's not going to think for half an hour   Should I give my hand  Not give my hand   He does it. There is a choice  but it's obvious  it's immediate. And then  also  there he had a choice. There are people who had choice  like Pastor Andr  Trocm  and his wife  and the whole village of Le Chambon sur Lignon in France. For the whole Second World War  they saved       Jews  gave them shelter  brought them to Switzerland  against all odds  at the risk of their lives and those of their family. So altruism does exist. So what is altruism  It is the wish  May others be happy and find the cause of happiness. Now  empathy is the affective resonance or cognitive resonance that tells you  this person is joyful  this person suffers. But empathy alone is not sufficient. If you keep on being confronted with suffering  you might have empathic distress  burnout  so you need the greater sphere of loving kindness. With Tania Singer at the Max Planck  Institute of Leipzig  we showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving kindness are different. Now  that's all well done  so we got that from evolution  from maternal care  parental love  but we need to extend that. It can be extended even to other species. Now  if we want a more altruistic society  we need two things  individual change and societal change. So is individual change possible  Two thousand years of contemplative study said yes  it is. Now     years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics said yes  our brains change when you train in altruism. So I spent     hours in an MRI machine. This is the first time I went after two and a half hours. And then the result has been published in many scientific papers. It shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love. Just to give you an idea  this is the meditator at rest on the left  meditator in compassion meditation  you see all the activity  and then the control group at rest  nothing happened  in meditation  nothing happened. They have not been trained. So do you need        hours  of meditation  No  you don't. Four weeks     minutes a day  of caring  mindfulness meditation already brings a structural change in the brain compared to a control group. That's only    minutes a day for four weeks. Even with preschoolers    Richard Davidson did that in Madison. An eight week program  gratitude  loving  kindness  cooperation  mindful breathing. You would say    Oh  they're just preschoolers.  Look after eight weeks  the pro social behavior  that's the blue line. And then comes the ultimate scientific test  the stickers test. Before  you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class  their least favorite child  an unknown child  and the sick child  and they have to give stickers away. So before the intervention  they give most of it to their best friend. Four  five years old      minutes three times a week. After the intervention  no more discrimination  the same amount of stickers to their  best friend and the least favorite child. That's something we should do in all the schools in the world. Now where do we go from there  When the Dalai Lama heard that  he told Richard Davidson   You go to    schools      schools  the U.N.  the whole world.  So now where do we go from there  Individual change is possible. Now do we have to wait for an altruistic  gene to be in the human race  That will take        years  too much for the environment. Fortunately  there is the evolution of culture. Cultures  as specialists have shown  change faster than genes. That's the good news. Look  attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years. So now individual change and cultural  change mutually fashion each other  and yes  we can achieve a more altruistic society. So where do we go from there  Myself  I will go back to the East. Now we treat         patients a year in our projects. We have        kids in school  four percent overhead. Some people say   Well  your stuff works in practice  but does it work in theory   There's always positive deviance. So I will also go back to my hermitage to find the inner resources to better serve others. But on the more global level  what can we do  We need three things. Enhancing cooperation  Cooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning  Unconditional cooperation within corporations    there can be some competition between corporations  but not within. We need sustainable harmony. I love this term. Not sustainable growth anymore. Sustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality. In the future  we do more with less  and we continue to grow qualitatively  not quantitatively. We need caring economics. The Homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty  cannot deal with the problem of the common goods of the atmosphere  of the oceans. We need a caring economics. If you say economics should be compassionate  they say   That's not our job.  But if you say they don't care  that looks bad. We need local commitment  global responsibility. We need to extend altruism to the other  .  million species. Sentient beings  are co citizens in this world. and we need to dare altruism. So  long live the altruistic revolution. Viva la revoluci n de altruismo. Thank you. My students and I work on very tiny robots. Now  you can think of these as robotic versions of something that you're all very familiar with  an ant. We all know that ants and other insects at this size scale can do some pretty incredible things. We've all seen a group of ants  or some version of that  carting off your potato chip at a picnic  for example. But what are the real challenges of engineering these ants  Well  first of all  how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale  Well  first we need to figure out how to make them move when they're so small. We need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomotion  and we need the sensors  power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi intelligent ant robot. And finally  to make these things really functional  we want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things. So I'll start with mobility. Insects move around amazingly well. This video is from UC Berkeley. It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over  and it's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials  which is what we traditionally use to make robots  and soft materials. Jumping is another really interesting way to get around when you're very small. So these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly to get the high power they need to jump out of water  for example. So one of the big contributions from my lab has been to combine rigid and soft materials in very  very small mechanisms. So this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side  so really tiny. The hard material here is silicon  and the soft material is silicone rubber. And the basic idea is that we're going to compress this  store energy in the springs  and then release it to jump. So there's no motors on board this right now  no power. This is actuated with a method that we call in my lab  graduate student with tweezers.   Laughter  So what you'll see in the next video is this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps. So this is Aaron  the graduate student in question  with the tweezers  and what you see is this  four millimeter sized mechanism jumping almost    centimeters high. That's almost     times its own length. And it survives  bounces on the table  it's incredibly robust  and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it's very tiny. Ultimately  though  we want to add motors to this too  and we have students in the lab working on millimeter sized motors to eventually integrate onto small  autonomous robots. But in order to look at mobility and locomotion at this size scale to start  we're cheating and using magnets. So this shows what would eventually be part of a micro robot leg  and you can see the silicone rubber joints and there's an embedded magnet that's being moved around by an external magnetic field. So this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier. The really interesting thing that this robot can help us figure out is how insects move at this scale. We have a really good model for how everything from a cockroach up to an elephant moves. We all move in this  kind of bouncy way when we run. But when I'm really small   the forces between my feet and the ground are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass  which is what causes that bouncy motion. So this guy doesn't work quite yet  but we do have slightly larger versions that do run around. So this is about a centimeter cubed  a centimeter on a side  so very tiny  and we've gotten this to run about    body lengths per second  so    centimeters per second. It's pretty quick for a little  small guy  and that's really only limited  by our test setup. But this gives you some idea of how it works right now. We can also make  D printed versions  of this that can climb over obstacles  a lot like the cockroach that you saw earlier. But ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot. We want sensing  power  control  actuation all together  and not everything needs to be bio inspired. So this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac. And in this case  instead of magnets or muscles to move this around  we use rockets. So this is a micro fabricated energetic material  and we can create tiny pixels of this  and we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot  and this robot  then  is going to jump when it senses an increase in light. So the next video is one of my favorites. So you have this     milligram robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air. It's only four by four by seven millimeters in size. And you'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off  and the robot tumbling through the air. So there was that big flash  and you can see the robot jumping up through the air. So there's no tethers on this  no wires connecting to this. Everything is onboard  and it jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it. So I think you can imagine all the cool things that we could do with robots that can run and crawl and jump and roll at this size scale. Imagine the rubble that you get after  a natural disaster like an earthquake. Imagine these small robots running through that rubble to look for survivors. Or imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge in order to inspect it and make sure it's safe so you don't get collapses like this  which happened outside of  Minneapolis in     . Or just imagine what you could do if you had robots that could swim through your blood. Right   Fantastic Voyage   Isaac Asimov. Or they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place. Or we could radically change the way we build things if we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do  and they build these incredible eight meter high mounds  effectively well ventilated apartment buildings for other termites in Africa and Australia. So I think I've given you some of the possibilities of what we can do with these small robots. And we've made some advances so far  but there's still a long way to go  and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination. Thanks very much. It is very fashionable and proper  to speak about food in all its forms  all its colors   aromas and tastes. But after the food goes through  the digestive system  when it is thrown out as crap  it is no longer fashionable to speak about it. It is rather revolting. I'm a guy who has graduated  from bullshit to full shit. My organization  Gram Vikas  which means  village development organization   was working in the area  of renewable energy. On the most part  we were  producing biogas  biogas for rural kitchens. We produce biogas in India  by using animal manure  which usually  in India   is called cow dung. But as the gender sensitive  person that I am  I would like to call it bullshit. But realizing later on how important were sanitation and the disposal of crap in a proper way  we went into the arena of sanitation. Eighty percent of all diseases  in India and most developing countries are because of poor quality water. And when we look at the reason  for poor quality water  you find that it is our abysmal attitude  to the disposal of human waste. Human waste  in its rawest form  finds its way back to drinking water  bathing water  washing water  irrigation water  whatever water you see. And this is the cause for    percent  of the diseases in rural areas. In India  it is unfortunately only the women who carry water. So for all domestic needs  women have to carry water. So that is a pitiable state of affairs. Open defecation is rampant. Seventy percent of India defecates in the open. They sit there out in the open  with the wind on their sails  hiding their faces  exposing their bases  and sitting there in pristine glory       percent of India. And if you look at the world total     percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by Indians. A fantastic distinction. I don't know if we Indians can be proud of such a distinction. So we  together with a lot of villages  we began to talk about how to really  address this situation of sanitation. And we came together and formed  a project called MANTRA. MANTRA stands for Movement and Action Network for Transformation of Rural Areas. So we are speaking about transformation  transformation in rural areas. Villages that agree  to implement this project  they organize a legal society where the general body  consists of all members who elect a group of men and women who implement the project and  later on  who look after the operation and maintenance. They decide to build a toilet  and a shower room. And from a protected water source  water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households through three taps  one in the toilet  one in the shower   one in the kitchen     hours a day. The pity is that our cities  like New Delhi and Bombay  do not have a    hour water supply. But in these villages  we want to have it. There is a distinct difference  in the quality. Well in India  we have a theory  which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter  that poor people deserve poor solutions and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions. This  combined with  a Nobel Prize worthy theory that the cheapest is the most economic  is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink. We are fighting against this. We feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries. And even in sanitation  they should not be humiliated. Sanitation is more about dignity than about human disposal of waste. And so you build these toilets  and very often  we have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses. And you can see that in front are  the attached houses and the others are the toilets. So these people  without a single exception of a family in a village  decide to build a toilet  a bathing room. And for that  they come together  collect all the local materials    local materials like rubble   sand  aggregates  usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost  of external materials like cement  steel  toilet commode. And they build a toilet  and a bathing room. Also  all the unskilled laborers  that is  daily wage earners  mostly landless  are given an opportunity to be  trained as masons and plumbers. So while these people are being trained   others are collecting the materials. And when both are ready  they build a toilet  a shower room  and of course also a water tower   an elevated water reservoir. We use a system of two leach pits  to treat the waste. From the toilet  the muck comes into the first leach pit. And when it is full  it is blocked  and it can go to the next. But we discovered that if you plant banana trees  papaya trees on the periphery of these leach pits  they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get very tasty bananas  papayas. If any of you come to my place  I would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you. So there you can see  the completed toilets  the water towers. This is in a village where  most of the people are even illiterate. It is always a    hour water supply because water gets polluted very often when you store it    a child dips his or her hand into it  something falls into it. So no water is stored. It's always on tap. This is how an elevated  water reservoir is constructed. And that is the end product. Because it has to go high  and there is some space available  two or three rooms are made under the water tower  which are used by the village for  different committee meetings. We have had clear evidence of the great impact of this program. Before we started  there were  as usual  more than    percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases. But after this  we have empirical evidence that    percent  on average  among all these villages          villages have completed it    waterborne diseases  have come down    percent. Women usually used to spend   especially in the summer months  about six to seven hours  a day carrying water. And when they went to carry water  because  as I said earlier  it's only women who carry water  they used to take their little children  girl children  also to carry water  or else to be back at home to look after the siblings. So there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school  even if there was a school. And boys  about    percent. But girls  it has gone to about    percent and boys  almost to     percent. The most vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers who are the daily wage earners. Because they have gone  through this training to be masons and plumbers and bar benders  now their ability to earn has  increased     to     percent. So this is a democracy in action because there is a general body   a governing board  the committee. People are questioning   people are governing themselves  people are learning to manage their own affairs  they are taking their own futures into their hands. And that is democracy at the grassroots level in action. More than       villages  have so far done this. It benefits over         people and it's still going on. And I hope it continues to move ahead. For India and such developing countries  armies and armaments  software companies and spaceships may not be as important as taps and toilets. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. When I was young  I prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative U.S. state I live in  Kansas. I didn't follow along with the crowd. I wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles. I was outspoken and extremely social. Even these pictures and postcards  of my London semester abroad    years ago show that I obviously didn't care if I was perceived as weird or different. But that same year  I was in London     years ago  I realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique  and that changed everything. I became the opposite of who I thought I once was. I stayed in my room instead of socializing. I stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities. I didn't want to stand out in the crowd anymore. I told myself it was because I was growing up and maturing  not that I was suddenly looking for acceptance. I had always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance. After all  I was a bit unconventional. But I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding. Hiding is a progressive habit  and once you start hiding  it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out. In fact  even now  when I was talking to people about what this talk was about  I made up a cover story and I even hid the truth about my TED Talk. So it is fitting and scary that I have returned  to this city    years later and I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding. What have I been hiding for    years  I am a lesbian. Thank you. I've struggled to say those words  because I didn't want to be defined by them. Every time I would think about coming out in the past  I would think to myself  but I just want to be known as Morgana  uniquely Morgana  but not  my lesbian friend Morgana   or  my gay coworker Morgana.  Just Morgana. For those of you from large metropolitan areas  this may not seem like a big deal to you. It may seem strange  that I have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long. But I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted. And I'm not alone  of course. A      Deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity. Of all the employees they surveyed     percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work. Of all the gay  lesbian and bisexual employees     percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves so they would not  appear at work  too gay.  The study found that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion programs  employees struggle to be themselves at work because they believe  conformity is critical to their long term career advancement. And while I was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves  I was scared when I discovered that my silence has life or death consequences and long term social repercussions. Twelve years  the length by which  life expectancy is shortened for gay  lesbian and bisexual people in highly anti gay communities compared to accepting communities. Twelve years reduced life expectancy. When I read that in The Advocate  magazine this year  I realized I could no longer afford to keep silent. The effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination. The study found that gays in anti gay communities had higher rates of heart disease  violence and suicide. What I once thought was simply a personal matter I realized had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine. My choice to hide and not share who I really am may have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment and atmosphere of discrimination. I'd always told myself there's no reason to share that I was gay  but the idea that my silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when I missed an opportunity to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of Kansas. In February  the Kansas House of  Representatives brought up a bill for vote that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services. A former coworker and friend of mine has a father who serves in the Kansas House of Representatives. He voted in favor of the bill  in favor of a law that would allow  businesses to not serve me. How does my friend feel about lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender  queer and questioning people  How does her father feel  I don't know  because I was never honest  with them about who I am. And that shakes me to the core. What if I had told her my story years ago  Could she have told  her father my experience  Could I have ultimately helped change his vote  I will never know  and that made me realize I had done nothing to try to make a difference. How ironic that I work in human resources  a profession that works to welcome  connect and encourage the development of employees  a profession that advocates that the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace  and yet I have done nothing to advocate for diversity. When I came to this company one year ago  I thought to myself  this company  has anti discrimination policies that protect gay  lesbian  bisexual and transgender people. Their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs. When I walk through the doors of this company  I will finally come out. But I didn't. Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity  I did nothing. When I was looking through my London journal and scrapbook from my London semester abroad    years ago  I came across this modified quote from Toni Morrison's book   Paradise.   There are more scary things inside than outside.  And then I wrote a note to myself at the bottom   Remember this.  I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore London  but the message I missed was the need  to start exploring and embracing myself. What I didn't realize until all these years later is that the biggest obstacles I will ever have to overcome are my own fears and insecurities. I believe that by facing my fears inside  I will be able to change reality outside. I made a choice today to reveal a part of myself that I have hidden for too long. I hope that this means I will never hide again  and I hope that by coming out today  I can do something to change the data and also to help others who feel different be more themselves and more fulfilled in both their professional and personal lives. Thank you. On June           precisely at      in a balmy winter afternoon in S o Paulo  Brazil  a typical South American winter afternoon  this kid  this young man  that you see celebrating here like he had scored a goal  Juliano Pinto     years old  accomplished a magnificent deed. Despite being paralyzed and not having any sensation from mid chest to the tip of his toes as the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother and produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left Juliano in a wheelchair  Juliano rose to the occasion  and on this day did something that pretty much everybody that saw him  in the six years deemed impossible. Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick of the      Brazilian  World Soccer Cup here just by thinking. He could not move his body  but he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball. He was an athlete before the lesion. He's a para athlete right now. He's going to be in the Paralympic Games  I hope  in a couple years. But what the spinal cord lesion  did not rob from Juliano was his ability to dream. And dream he did that afternoon  for a stadium of about        people and an audience of close to a billion watching on TV. And that kick crowned  basically     years of basic research studying how the brain  how this amazing universe that we have between our ears that is only comparable to universe that we have above our head because it has about     billion elements talking to each other through electrical brainstorms  what Juliano accomplished took    years to imagine in laboratories and about    years to plan. When John Chapin and I     years ago  proposed in a paper that we would build something that we called a brain machine interface  meaning connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices  no matter how far they are from their own bodies  just by imagining what they want to do  our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help  of the psychiatry variety. And despite that  a Scot and a Brazilian persevered  because that's how we were raised in our respective countries  and for        years  we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible. And a brain machine interface is not rocket science  it's just brain research. It's nothing but using sensors to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing to generate the motor commands that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord  so we projected sensors that can read hundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously  and extract from these electrical signals the motor planning that the brain is generating to actually make us move into space. And by doing that  we converted these signals into digital commands that any mechanical  electronic  or even a virtual device can understand so that the subject can imagine what he  she or it wants to make move  and the device obeys that brain command. By sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors  as you are going to see in a moment  we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm that that voluntary motor will was being enacted  no matter where    next to the subject  next door  or across the planet. And as this message gave feedback back to the brain  the brain realized its goal  to make us move. So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago  where a monkey  without moving its body  learned to control the movements of an avatar arm  a virtual arm that doesn't exist. What you're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey as it explores three different visually identical spheres in virtual space. And to get a reward  a drop of orange juice that monkeys love  this animal has to detect  select one of these objects by touching  not by seeing it  by touching it  because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects  an electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal describing the fine texture of the surface of this object  so the animal can judge what is  the correct object that he has to grab  and if he does that  he gets a reward without moving a muscle. The perfect Brazilian lunch  not moving a muscle and getting your orange juice. So as we saw this happening  we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published    years ago. We reenacted this paper. We got it out of the drawers  and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed to actually use the brain machine interface to regain mobility. The idea was that if you suffered    and that can happen to any one of us. Let me tell you  it's very sudden. It's a millisecond of a collision  a car accident that transforms your life completely. If you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord  you cannot move because your brainstorms cannot reach your muscles. However  your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head. Paraplegic  quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night. They have that inside their head. The problem is how to get that code out of it and make the movement be created again. So what we proposed was  let's create a new body. Let's create a robotic vest. And that's exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking  because he was wearing the first brain controlled robotic vest that can be used by paraplegic  quadriplegic patients to move and to regain feedback. That was the original idea     years ago. What I'm going to show you is how     people from    countries all over the five continents of this beautiful Earth  dropped their lives  dropped their patents  dropped their dogs  wives  kids  school  jobs  and congregated to come to Brazil for    months to actually get this done. Because a couple years after Brazil was awarded the World Cup  we heard that the Brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the Germans  of course. But that's a different talk  and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that. But what Brazil wanted to do is to showcase a completely different country  a country that values science and technology  and can give a gift to millions     million people around the world that cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury. Well  we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed  well  let's have the kickoff of the      World Cup be given by a Brazilian paraplegic using a brain controlled exoskeleton that allows him to kick the ball and to feel the contact of the ball. They looked at us  thought that we were completely nuts  and said   Okay  let's try.  We had    months to do everything from zero  from scratch. We had no exoskeleton  we had no patients  we had nothing done. These people came all together and in    months  we got eight patients in a routine of training and basically built from nothing this guy  that we call Bra Santos Dumont  . The first brain controlled exoskeleton to be built was named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever  Alberto Santos Dumont  who  on October           created and flew himself the first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see. Sorry  my American friends  I live in North Carolina  but it was two years before the Wright Brothers flew on the coast of North Carolina. Flight control is Brazilian.  Laughter  So we went together with these guys and we basically put this exoskeleton together     degrees of freedom  hydraulic machine that can be commanded by brain signals recorded by a non invasive technology called electroencephalography that can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements and send his commands to the controls  the motors  and get it done. This exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin invented by Gordon Cheng  one of my greatest friends  in Munich  to allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground to be delivered back to the patient through a vest  a shirt. It is a smart shirt with micro vibrating elements that basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient's brain by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him  but it is he who is walking again. So we got this going  and what you'll see here is the first time one of our patients  Bruno  actually walked. And he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything  and you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet because Bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs to be performed  the computer is going to analyze it  Bruno is going to certify it  and when it is certified  the device starts moving under the command of Bruno's brain. And he just got it right  and now he starts walking. After nine years without being able to move  he is walking by himself. And more than that    more than just walking  he is feeling the ground  and if the speed of the exo goes up  he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos  the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident. That's why the brain is creating a new sensation in Bruno's head. So he walks  and at the end of the walk    I am running out of time already    he says   You know  guys  I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married  because I wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself. Of course  he will have it whenever he wants. And this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup  and couldn't  because for some mysterious reason  FIFA cut its broadcast in half. What you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick a few minutes before we went to the pitch and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd  and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation. Basically  the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go. It can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback  and when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball  you are going to see two streams of green and yellow light coming from the helmet and going to the legs  representing the mental commands that were taken by the exo to actually make that happen. And in basically    seconds  Juliano actually did. You can see the commands. He gets ready   the ball is set  and he kicks. And the most amazing thing is     seconds after he did that  and looked at us on the pitch  he told us  celebrating as you saw   I felt the ball.  And that's priceless. So where is this going to go  I have two minutes to tell you that it's going to the limits of your imagination. Brain actuating technology is here. This is the latest  We just published this a year ago  the first brain to brain interface that allows two animals to exchange mental messages so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment can send a mental SMS  a torpedo  a neurophysiological torpedo  to the second animal  and the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform without ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message  because the message came from the first animal's brain. So this is the first demo. I'm going to be very quick because I want to show you the latest. But what you see here is the first rat getting informed by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage that he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward. He goes there and does it. And the same time  he is sending a mental message to the second rat that didn't see any light  and the second rat  in    percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward without ever experiencing the light in the retina. Well  we took this to a little higher limit by getting monkeys to collaborate  mentally in a brain net  basically to donate their brain activity and combine them to move the virtual arm that I showed you before  and what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine their brains  synchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move. One monkey is controlling the x dimension  the other monkey is controlling the y dimension. But it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there and you ask one monkey to control x and y  the other monkey to control y and z  and the third one to control x and z  and you make them all play the game together  moving the arm in  D into a target to get the famous Brazilian orange juice. And they actually do. The black dot is the average of all these brains working in parallel  in real time. That is the definition of a biological computer  interacting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal. Where is this going  We have no idea. We're just scientists. We are paid to be children  to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there. But one thing I know  One day  in a few decades  when our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking  or a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see  or somebody speaks because of a brain to brain bypass  some of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon in a Brazilian soccer field with an impossible kick. Thank you. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Miguel  thank you for sticking to your time. I actually would have given you a couple more minutes  because there are a couple of points we want to develop  and  of course  clearly it seems that we need connected  brains to figure out where this is going. So let's connect all this together. So if I'm understanding correctly  one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse. Miguel Nicolelis   No  it's a little different. No monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys. They are getting a visual feedback in  D  but the task they have to accomplish is  D. They have to move an arm in three dimensions. But each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen that the monkey controls. And to get that thing done  you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains  but the ideal is three. So what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down  the other two monkeys enhance their performance to get the guy to come back  so this adjusts dynamically  but the global synchrony remains the same. Now  if you flip without telling the monkey the dimensions that each brain has to control  like this guy is controlling x and y  but he should be controlling now y and z  instantaneously  that animal's brain forgets about the old dimensions and it starts concentrating on the new dimensions. So what I need to say is that no Turing machine  no computer can predict what a brain net will do. So we will absorb technology as part of us. Technology will never absorb us. It's simply impossible. BG  How many times have you tested this  And how many times have you succeeded versus failed  MN  Oh  tens of times. With the three monkeys  Oh  several times. I wouldn't be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times. And I forgot to mention  because of time  that just three weeks ago  a European group just demonstrated the first man to man brain to brain connection. BG  And how does that play  MN  There was one bit of information    big ideas start in a humble way    but basically the brain activity of one subject was transmitted to a second object  all non invasive technology. So the first subject got a message  like our rats  a visual message  and transmitted it to the second subject. The second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex  or a different pulse  two different pulses. In one pulse  the subject saw something. On the other pulse  he saw something different. And he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending through the Internet across continents. Moderator  Wow. Okay  that's where we are going. That's the next TED Talk at the next conference. Miguel Nicolelis  thank you. MN  Thank you  Bruno. Thank you. I want to speak about  a forgotten conflict. It's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines. It happens right here  in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now  most people outside of Africa don't know much about the war in Congo  so let me give you a couple of key facts. The Congolese conflict is the deadliest  conflict since World War II. It has caused almost four million deaths. It has destabilized most of Central Africa for the past    years. It is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world. That's why I first went to Congo in     . I was a young humanitarian aid worker  and I met this woman who was my age. She was called Isabelle. Local militias had attacked Isabelle's village. They had killed many men  raped many women. They had looted everything. And then they wanted to take Isabelle  but her husband stepped in  and he said   No  please don't take Isabelle. Take me instead.  So he had gone to the forest with the militias  and Isabelle had never seen him again. Well  it's because of people like Isabelle and her husband that I have devoted my career to studying this war that we know so little about. Although there is one story about Congo that you may have heard. It's a story about minerals and rape. Policy statements and media reports both usually focus on a primary cause of violence in Congo    the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources    and on a main consequence    sexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war. So  not that these two issues aren't important and tragic. They are. But today I want to tell you  a different story. I want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause of the ongoing conflict. Violence in Congo is in large part driven by local bottom up conflicts that international peace efforts have failed to help address. The story starts from the fact that not only is Congo notable for being the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis  but it is also home to some of the largest international peacebuilding efforts in the world. Congo hosts the largest and most expensive United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world. It was also the site of the first European led peacekeeping mission  and for its first cases ever  the International Criminal Court chose to prosecute Congolese warlords. In       when Congo held the first  free national elections in its history  many observers thought that an end to  violence in the region had finally come. The international community lauded the  successful organization of these elections as finally an example of successful international intervention in a failed state. But the eastern provinces have continued to face massive population displacements and horrific human rights violations. Shortly before I went back there last summer  there was a horrible massacre in the province of South Kivu. Thirty three people were killed. They were mostly women and children  and many of them were hacked to death. During the past eight years  fighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited full scale civil and international war. So basically  every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace  the conflict explodes again. Why  Why have the massive international efforts failed to help Congo  achieve lasting peace and security  Well  my answer to this question revolves around two central observations. First  one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in Congo is fundamentally local    and when I say local  I really mean at the level of the individual  the family  the clan  the municipality  the community  the district  sometimes the ethnic group. For instance  you remember the story of Isabelle that I told you. Well  the reason why militias had attacked Isabelle's village was because they wanted to take the land that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive. The second central observation is that international peace efforts have failed to help address local conflicts because of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture. So what I mean is that Western and African diplomats  United Nations peacekeepers  donors  the staff of most nongovernmental organizations that work with the resolution of conflict  they all share a specific way of seeing the world. And I was one of these people  and I shared this culture  so I know all too well how powerful it is. Throughout the world  and throughout conflict zones  this common culture shapes the intervener's understanding of the causes of violence as something that is primarily located in the national and international spheres. It shapes our understanding of the path toward peace as something again that requires top down intervention to address national and international tensions. And it shapes our understanding of the roles of foreign actors as engaging in national and international peace processes. Even more importantly  this common culture enables international peacebuilders to ignore the micro level tensions that often jeopardize the macro level settlements. So for instance  in Congo  because of how they are socialized and trained  United Nations officials  donors  diplomats  the staff of most nongovernmental organizations  they interpret continued fighting and massacres as a top down problem. To them  the violence they see is the consequence of tensions between President Kabila and various national opponents  and tensions between Congo  Rwanda and Uganda. In addition  these international  peacebuilders view local conflicts as simply the result of national and international tensions  insufficient state authority  and what they call the Congolese people's so called inherent penchant for violence. The dominant culture also constructs intervention at the national and international levels as the only natural and legitimate task for United Nations staffers and diplomats. And it elevates the organization of general elections  which is now a sort of cure all  as the most crucial state reconstruction mechanism over more effective state building approaches. And that happens not only in Congo but also in many other conflict zones. But let's dig deeper  into the other main sources of violence. In Congo  continuing violence is motivated not only by the national and international causes but also by longstanding bottom up agendas whose main instigators are villagers  traditional chiefs  community chiefs or ethnic leaders. Many conflicts revolve around political  social and economic stakes that are distinctively local. For instance  there is a lot of competition at the village or district level over who can be chief of village or chief of territory according to traditional law  and who can control the distribution of land and the exploitation of local mining sites. This competition often results in localized fighting  for instance in one village or territory  and quite frequently  it escalates into generalized fighting  so across a whole province  and even at times into neighboring countries. Take the conflict between Congolese  of Rwandan descent and the so called indigenous  communities of the Kivus. This conflict started in the     s during Belgian colonization  when both communities competed over access to land and to local power. Then  in       after Congolese independence  it escalated because each camp tried to align with national politicians  but still to advance their local agendas. And then  at the time of the      genocide in Rwanda  these local actors allied with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups  but still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the Kivus. And since then  these local disputes over land and local power have fueled violence  and they have regularly jeopardized the national and international settlements. So we can wonder why in these circumstances the international peacebuilders have failed to help implement local peacebuilding programs. And the answer is that international interveners deem the resolution of grassroots conflict an unimportant  unfamiliar  and illegitimate task. The very idea of becoming involved at the local level clashes fundamentally with existing cultural norms  and it threatens key organizational interests. For instance  the very identity of the United Nations as this macro level diplomatic organization would be upended if it were to refocus on local conflicts. And the result is that neither the internal resistance to the dominant ways of working nor the external shocks have managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate their understanding of violence and intervention. And so far  there have been only very few exceptions. There have been exceptions  but only very few exceptions  to this broad pattern. So to wrap up  the story I just told you is a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture shapes the intervener's understanding of what the causes of violence are  how peace is made  and what interventions should accomplish. These understandings enable international peacebuilders to ignore the micro level foundations that are so necessary for sustainable peace. The resulting inattention to local conflicts leads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term and potential war resumption in the long term. And what's fascinating is that this analysis helps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict and international intervention failures  in Africa and elsewhere. Local conflicts fuel violence in most war and post war environments  from Afghanistan to Sudan to Timor Leste  and in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive  bottom up peacebuilding initiatives  these attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable. One of the best examples is the contrast between the relatively peaceful situation in Somaliland  which benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives  and the violence prevalent in the rest of Somalia  where peacebuilding has been mostly top down. And there are several other cases in which local  grassroots conflict resolution has made a crucial difference. So if we want international peacebuilding to work  in addition to any top down intervention  conflicts must be resolved from the bottom up. And again  it's not that national and international tensions don't matter. They do. And it's not that national and international peacebuilding isn't necessary. It is. Instead  it is that both macro level and micro level peacebuilding are needed to make peace sustainable  and local nongovernmental organizations  local authorities and  civil society representatives should be the main actors in the bottom up process. So of course  there are obstacles. Local actors often lack the funding and sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity to implement effective  local peacebuilding programs. So international actors should expand their funding and support for local conflict resolution. As for Congo  what can be done  After two decades of conflict and the deaths of millions  it's clear that we need to change our approach. Based on my field research  I believe that international and Congolese actors should pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict and the promotion of inter community reconciliation. So for instance  in the province of the Kivus  the Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese partners have set up inter community forums to discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land  and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence. That's the kind of program that is sorely needed throughout eastern Congo. It's with programs like this that we can help people like Isabelle and her husband. So these will not be magic wands  but because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence  they could definitely be game changers. Thank you. Hi. Today I'm going to share my personal journey with female genital mutilation  FGM. Feel free to cry  laugh  cross your legs  or do anything your body feels like doing. I'm not going to name the things your body does. I was born in Sierra Leone. Did anybody watch  Blood Diamond   If you have any thoughts    I don't have any diamonds  on me  by the way. If you have heard of Ebola  well  that's in Sierra Leone as well. I don't have Ebola. You're all safe. Don't rush to the door. Be seated. You're fine. I was checked before I got here. My grandfather had three wives. Don't ask me why a man needs more than one wife. Men  do you need more than one wife  I don't think so. There you go. He was looking for a heart attack  that's what I say. Oh yeah  he was. When I was three  war broke out in Sierra Leone in     . I remember literally going to bed one night  everything was good. The next day  I woke up  bombs were dropping everywhere  and people were trying to kill me and my family. We escaped the war and ended up in Gambia  in West Africa. Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it. While we were there as refugees  we didn't know what was going to become of us. My mom applied for refugee status. She's a wonderful  smart woman  that one  and we were lucky. Australia said  we will take you in. Good job  Aussies. Before we were meant to travel  my mom came home one day  and said   We're going on  a little holiday  a little trip.  She put us in a car  and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in Gambia. In this bush  we found two huts. An old lady came towards us. She was ethnic looking  very old. She had a chat with my mom  and went back. Then she came back and walked away from us into a second hut. I'm standing there thinking   This is very confusing. I don't know what's going on.  The next thing I knew  my mom took me into this hut. She took my clothes off  and then she pinned me down on the floor. I struggled and tried to get her off me  but I couldn't. Then the old lady came towards me with a rusty looking knife  one of the sharp knives  orange looking  has never seen water or sunlight before. I thought she was going to slaughter me  but she didn't. She slowly slid down my body and ended up where my vagina is. She took hold of what I now know to be my clitoris  she took that rusty knife  and started cutting away  inch by inch. I screamed  I cried  and asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop  but all she did was say   Be quiet.  This old lady sawed away at my flesh for what felt like forever  and then when she was done  she threw that piece of flesh across the floor as if it was the most disgusting thing she's ever touched. They both got off me  and left me there bleeding  crying  and confused as to what just happened. We never talked about this again. Very soon  we found that we were coming to Australia  and this is when you had the Sydney Olympics at the time  and people said we were going to the end of the world  there was nowhere else to go after Australia. Yeah  that comforted us a bit. It took us three days to get here. We went to Senegal  then France  and then Singapore. We went to the bathroom to wash our hands. We spent    minutes opening the tap like this. Then somebody came in  slid their hand under and water came out  and we thought  is this what we're in for  Like  seriously. We got to Adelaide  small place  where literally they dumped us in Adelaide  that's what I would say. They dumped us there. We were very grateful. We settled and we liked it. We were like   We're home  we're here.  Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall. Adelaide has only one mall. It's this small place. And we saw a lot of Asian people. My mom said all of a sudden  panicking   You brought us to the wrong place. You must take us back to Australia.  Yeah. It had to be explained to her that  there were a lot of Asians in Australia and we were in the right place. So fine  it's all good. My mom then had this brilliant idea that I should go to a girls school because they were less racist. I don't know where she read  that publication.  Laughter  Never found evidence of it to this day. Six hundred white kids   and I was the only black child there. No  I was the only person with a bit of a color on me. Let me say that. Chocolate color. There were no Asians  no indigenous. All we had was some tan girls  girls who felt the need to be under the sun. It wasn't the same as my chocolate  though. Not the same. Settling in Australia was quite hard  but it became harder when I started volunteering for an organization called Women's Health Statewide  and I joined their female genital mutilation program without any awareness of what this program was actually about  or that it related to me in any way. I spent months educating nurses and doctors about what female genital mutilation was and where it was practiced  Africa  the Middle East  Asia  and now  Australia and London and America  because  as we all know  we live in a multicultural society  and people who come from those backgrounds come with their culture  and sometimes they have cultural practices that we may not agree with  but they continue to practice them. One day  I was looking at the chart of the different types of female genital mutilation  FGM  I will just say FGM for short. Type I is when they cut off the hood. Type II is when they cut off the whole clitoris and some of your labia majora  or your outer lips  and Type III is when they  cut off the whole clitoris and then they sew you up so you only have a little hole to pee and have your period. My eyes went onto Type II. Before all of this  I pretty much had amnesia. I was in so much shock  and traumatized by what had happened  I didn't remember any of it. Yes  I was aware something bad happened to me  but I had no recollection of what had happened. I knew I had a scar down there  but I thought everybody had a scar down there. This had happened to everybody else. But when I looked at Type II  it all came back to me. I remembered what was done to me. I remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down. Words cannot express the pain I felt  the confusion that I felt  because now I realized that  what was done to me was a terrible thing that in this society was called barbaric  it was called mutilation. My mother had said it was called circumcision  but here it was mutilation. I was thinking  I'm mutilated  I'm a mutilated person. Oh my God. And then the anger came. I was a black angry woman.  Laughter  Oh yeah. A little one  but angry nevertheless. I went home and said to my mom   You did something.  This is not the African thing to do  pointing at your mother  but hey  I was ready for any consequences.  You did something to me.  She's like   What are you talking about  Khadija   She's used to me mouthing off. I'm like   Those years ago  You circumcised me. You cut away something that belonged to me.  She said   Yes  I did. I did it for your own good. It was in your best interest. Your grandmother did it to me  and I did it to you. It's made you a woman.  I'm like   How   She said   You're empowered  Khadija. Do you get itchy down there   I'm like   No  why would I get itchy down there   She said   Well  if you were not circumcised  you would get itchy down there. Women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time. Then they sleep around with everybody. You are not going to sleep around with anybody.  And I thought  her definition of empowerment was very strange.  Laughter  That was the end of our first conversation. I went back to school. These were the days when we had  Dolly and Girlfriend magazines. There was always the sealed section. Anybody remember those sealed sections  The naughty bits  you know  Oh yeah  I love those.  Laughter  Anyway  there was always an article about pleasure and relationships and  of course  sex. But it always assumed that you had a clitoris  though  and I thought  this doesn't fit me. This doesn't talk about people like me. I don't have a clitoris. I watched TV and those women would moan like   Oh  Oh   I was like  these people and their damned clitoris. What is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life  That's what I want to know. I want to do that too     Oh  Oh   and all of that. Didn't happen. So I came home once again and said to my mom   Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure  that I should be having orgasms  and that white men should figure out how to find the clitoris.  Apparently  white men have a problem finding the clitoris. Just saying  it wasn't me. It was Dolly that said that. And I thought to myself  I had an inner joke in my head that said   I will marry a white man. He won't have that problem with me.   Laughter  So I said to my mom   Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure  and do you know what you have taken away from me  what you have denied me  You have invaded me in the most sacred way. I want pleasure. I want to get horny  dammit  as well.  And she said to me   Who is Dolly and Girlfriend  Are they your new friends  Khadija   I was like   No  they're not. That's a magazine  mom  a magazine.  She didn't get it. We came from two different worlds. When she was growing up  not having a clitoris was the norm. It was celebrated. I was an African Australian girl. I lived in a society that was very clitoris centric. It was all about the damn clitoris  And I didn't have one  That pissed me off. So once I went through this strange phase of anger and pain and confusion  I remember booking an appointment with my therapist. Yes  I'm an African  who has a therapist. There you go. And I said to her   I was   . I was a child. I was settling in a new country  I was dealing with racism and discrimination  English is my third language  and then there it was.  I said to her   I feel like I'm not a woman because of what was done to me. I feel incomplete. Am I going to be asexual   Because from what I knew about FGM  the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women. It's so that we don't have any sexual desire. And I said   Am I asexual now  Will I just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex  not enjoying sex   She couldn't answer my questions  so they went unanswered. When I started having my period around the age of     I realized I didn't have  normal periods because of FGM. My periods were heavy  they were long  and they were very painful. Then they told me I had fibroids. They're like these little balls sitting there. One was covering one of my ovaries. And there came then the big news.  We don't think you can have children  Khadija.  And once again  I was an angry black woman. I went home and I said to my mom   Your act  your action  no matter what your may defense may be     because she thought she did it out love     what you did out of love  is harming me  and it's hurting me. What do you have to say for that   She said   I did what I had to do as a mother.  I'm still waiting for an apology  by the way. Then I got married. And once again    FGM is like the gift that keeps giving. You figure that out very soon. Sex was very painful. It hurt all the time. And of course I realized  they said   You can't have kids.  I thought   Wow  is this my existence  Is this what life is all about   I'm proud to tell you  five months ago  I was told I was pregnant. I am the lucky girl. There are so many women out there who have gone through FGM who have infertility. I know a nine year old girl who has incontinence  constant infections  pain. It's that gift. It doesn't stop giving. It affects every area of your life  and this happened to me because I was born a girl in the wrong place. That's why it happened to me. I channel all that anger   all that pain  into advocacy because I needed my pain to be worth something. So I'm the director of an organization called No FGM Australia. You heard me right. Why No FGM Australia  FGM is in Australia. Two days ago  I had to call Child Protective Services  because somewhere in Australia  there's a four year old there's a four year old whose mom  is planning on performing FGM on her. That child is in kindy. I'll let that sink in  four years old. A couple of months ago  I met a lady who is married to a Malaysian man. Her husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters back to Malaysia to cut off their clitoris. And she said   Why   He said they were dirty. And she said   Well  you married me.  He said   Oh  this is my cultural belief.  They then went into a whole discussion where she said to him   Over my dead body will you do that to my daughters.  But imagine if this woman wasn't aware of what FGM was  if they never had that conversation  Her children would have been flown over to Malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives. Do you know the millions of dollars it would take us to deal with an issue like that   Three children per day  in Australia are at risk of having FGM performed on them. This is an Australian problem  people. It's not an African problem. It's not a Middle Eastern problem. It's not white  it's not black  it has no color  it's everybody's problem. FGM is child abuse. It's violence against women. It's saying that women don't have a right to sexual pleasure. It says we don't have a right to our bodies. Well  I say no to that  and you know what  Bullshit. That's what I have to say to that. I am proud to say that I'm doing my part in ending FGM. What are you going to do  There may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of FGM. There may be a patient who comes to your hospital who is at risk of FGM. But this is the reality  that even in our beloved Australia  the most wonderful place in the world  children are being abused because of a culture. Culture should not be a defense for child abuse. I want ever single one of you to see FGM as an issue for you. Make it personal. It could be your daughter  your sister  your cousin. I can't fight FGM alone. I could try  but I can't. So my appeal to you is  please join me. Sign my petition on Change.org and type in Khadija  my name  and it'll come up  and sign it. The aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them  because every child has a right to pleasure. Every child has a right to their bodies being left intact  and dammit  ever child has a right to a clitoris. So please join me in ending this act. My favorite quote is   All it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men and women to do nothing.  Are you going to let this evil of female genital mutilation to prevail in Australia  I don't think so  so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation. Thank you. I'm a blogger  a filmmaker and a butcher  and I'll explain how these identities come together. It started four years ago  when a friend and I opened our first Ramadan fast at one of the busiest mosques in New York City. Crowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets. It was an FBI agent's wet dream.  Laughter  But being a part of this community  we knew how welcoming this space was. For years  I'd seen photos  of this space being documented as a lifeless and cold monolith  much like the stereotypical image painted of the American Muslim experience. Frustrated by this myopic view  my friend and I had this crazy idea  Let's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state each night of Ramadan and share those stories on a blog. We called it     Mosques in    Days   and we drove to all the    states and shared stories from over     vastly different Muslim communities  ranging from the Cambodian refugees in the L.A. projects to the black Sufis living in the woods of South Carolina. What emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America. The media coverage forced local journalists to revisit their Muslim communities  but what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world being inspired to take their own    mosque journey. There were even these two NFL athletes who took a sabbatical from the league to do so. And as    Mosques was blossoming around the world  I was actually stuck in Pakistan working on a film. My codirector  Omar  and I were at  a breaking point with many of our friends on how to position the film. The movie is called  These Birds Walk   and it is about wayward street kids who are struggling to find some semblance of family. We focus on the complexities of youth and family discord  but our friends kept on nudging us to comment on drones and target killings to make the film  more relevant   essentially reducing these people who have entrusted us with their stories into sociopolitical symbols. Of course  we didn't listen to them  and instead  we championed the tender gestures of love and headlong flashes of youth. The agenda behind our cinematic  immersion was only empathy  an emotion that's largely  deficient from films that come from our region of the world. And as  These Birds Walk  played at film  festivals and theaters internationally  I finally had my feet planted at home in New York  and with all the extra time and still no real money  my wife tasked me to cook more for us. And whenever I'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat  something felt off. For those that don't know  halal is a term used for meat that is raised and slaughtered humanely following very strict Islamic guidelines. Unfortunately  the majority of halal meat in America doesn't rise to the standard that my faith calls for. The more I learned about these unethical practices  the more violated I felt  particularly because businesses from my own community were the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy. So  with emotions running high  and absolutely no experience in butchery  some friends and I opened a meat store in the heart of the East Village fashion district. We call it Honest Chops  and we're reclaiming halal by sourcing organic  humanely raised animals  and by making it accessible and affordable to working class families. There's really nothing like it in America. The unbelievable part is actually that    percent of our in store customers are not even Muslim. For many  it is their first time  interacting with Islam on such an intimate level. So all these disparate projects     Laughter     are the result of a restlessness. They are a visceral response to the businesses and curators who work hard to oversimplify my beliefs and my community  and the only way to beat their machine is to play by different rules. We must fight with an inventive approach. With the trust  with the access  with the love that only we can bring  we must unapologetically reclaim our beliefs in every moving image  in every cut of meat  because if we whitewash our stories for the sake of mass appeal  not only will we fail  but we will be trumped by those with more money and more resources to tell our stories. But the call for creative courage is not for novelty or relevance. It is simply because our communities are so damn unique and so damn beautiful. They demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected. Thank you.
