So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl   If you say a word often enough  it becomes you.  And having grown up in a segregated city  Baltimore  Maryland  I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder    thank God for technology    to interview people  thinking that if I walked in their words    which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform    if I walked in their words  that I could sort of absorb America. I was also inspired by Walt Whitman  who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him. So these four characters are going to be from that work that I've been doing for many years now  and well over  I don't know  a couple of thousand people I've interviewed. Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel  that old radio man  So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history. You know  he was  born in       the year the Titanic sank  greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg  and bam  it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow  some century.  So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.  Defining moment in American history  I don't think there's one  you can't say Hiroshima  that's a big one    I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment. The gradual slippage    'slippage' is the word used by the people in Watergate  moral slippage    it's a gradual kind of thing  combination of things. You see  we also have the technology. I say  less and less the human touch.  Oh  let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit. The Atlanta airport is a modern airport  and they should leave the gate there. These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination. And these trains are smooth  and they're quiet and they're efficient. And there's a voice on the train  you know the voice was a human voice. You see in the old days we had robots  robots imitated humans. Now we have humans imitating robots. So we got this voice on this train  Concourse One  Omaha  Lincoln. Concourse Two  Dallas  Fort Worth. Same voice. Just as a train is about to go  a young couple rush in and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors. And that voice  without losing a beat  says  'Because of late entry  we're delayed    seconds.' Just then  everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple's going like this  you know  shrinking. Well  I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding    I do that to steel my nerves    and so I imitate a train call  holding my hand on my    'George Orwell  your time has come ' you see. Well  some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs when I say that  but not on this train. Silence. And so suddenly they're looking at me. So here I am with the couple  the three of us shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up  you know.  Just then I see a baby  a little baby in the lap of a mother. I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion. So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby  holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be     proof  I say to the baby  'Sir or Madam  what is your considered opinion of the human species ' And the baby looks  you know  the way babies look at you clearly  starts laughing  starts busting out with this crazy little laugh. I say  'Thank God for a human reaction  we haven't lost yet.'  But you see  the human touch  you see  it's disappearing. You know  you see  you've got to question the official truth. You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain    you know we honor Mark Twain  but we don't read him. We read 'Huck Finn ' of course  we read 'Huck Finn' of course. I mean  Huck  of course  was tremendous. Remember that great scene on the raft  remember what Huck did  You see  here's Huck  he's an illiterate kid  he's had no schooling  but there's something in him. And the official truth  the truth was  the law was  that a black man was a property  was a thing  you see. And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim  a slave  see. And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them  and Huck says  'Ooh  oh my God  ooh  ooh    that woman  that woman never did anybody any harm. Ooh  he's going to steal  he's going to steal  he's going to do a terrible thing.' Just then  two slavers caught up  guys chasing slaves  looking for Jim. 'Anybody up on that raft with you ' Huck says  'Yeah.' 'Is he black or white ' 'White.' And they go off. And Huck said  'Oh my God  oh my God  I lied  I lied  ooh  I did a terrible thing  did a terrible thing    why do I feel so good '  But it's the goodness of Huck  that stuff that Huck's been made of  you see  all been buried  it's all been buried. So the human touch  you see  it's disappearing. So you ask about a defining moment    ain't no defining moment in American history for me. It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now  where trivia becomes news. And more and more  less and less awareness of the pain of the other. Huh. You know  I don't know if you could use this or not  but I was quoting Wright Morris  a writer from Nebraska  who says  'We're more and more into communications and less and less into communication.' Okay  kids  I got to scram  got to go see my cardiologist.  And that's Studs Terkel. So  talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes. You know  most actors want to do characters that are likeable    well  not always  but the notion  especially at a conference like this  I like to inspire people. But since this was called  risk taking   I'm doing somebody who I never do  because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in. And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk  at a conference like this  as a good thing. But there are certain other connotations to the word  risk   and the same thing about the word  nature.  What is nature  Maxine Greene  who's a wonderful philosopher who's as old as Studs  and was the head of a philosophy    great  big philosophy kind of an organization    I went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know  that she still wants to know. And she said   Well  personally  I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university. And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee for my male colleagues  even though I've outlived most of them.  And she said   And then intellectually  I don't know enough about the negative imagination. And September   th certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate.  So this piece is about a negative imagination. It raises questions about what nature is  what Mother Nature is  and about what a risk can be. And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women. Everything I do is word for word off a tape. And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems  and this is called  A Mirror to Her Mouth.  And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.  I began to learn how to cover it up  because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home. I want everybody to think we were a normal family. I mean we had all the materialistic things  but that didn't make my children pain any less  that didn't make their fears subside. I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses. And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family  it was a nightmare. And I failed them dramatically  because I allowed it to go on and on and on.  But the night that Myesha got killed    and the intensity just grew and grew and grew  until one night we came home from getting drugs  and he got angry with Myesha  and he started beating her  and he put her in a bathtub. Oh  he would use a belt. He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that Myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other    that would be his reason. I'm just talking about the particular night that she died. And so he put her in the bathtub  and I was in the bedroom with the baby.  And four months before this happened  four months before Myesha died  I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him    insane    thinking that if I gave him his own kid  he would leave mine alone. And it didn't work  didn't work. And I ended up with three children  Houston  Myesha and Dominic  who was four months old when I came to jail.  And I was in the bedroom. Like I said  he had her in the bathroom and he    he    every time he hit her  she would fall. And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously  repeatedly. I could hear it  but I dared not to move. I didn't move. I didn't even go and see what was happening. I just sat there and listened. And then he put her in the hallway. He told her  just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours. And then he told her  get up. And when she got up  she says she couldn't see. Her face was bruised. She had a black eye. All around her head was just swollen  her head was about two sizes of its own size. I told him  'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.  The next morning she was dead. He went in to check on her for school  and he got very excited. He says  'She won't breathe.' I knew immediately that she was dead. I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead  so I went in and I put a mirror to her mouth    there was no thing  nothing  coming out of her mouth. He said  he said  he said  'We can't  we can't let nobody find out about this.' He say  'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.  I mean  I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years  so it just seemed like second hand to me  just to keep on keeping it a secret. So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had  like  lost her  that she was missing. We told a security guard that she was missing  though she wasn't missing. And we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard that we had put on her.  And then we got the baby and my other child  and we drove out to  like  I   . I was so petrified and so numb  all I could look was in the rear view mirror. And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway. My own child  I let that happen to.  So that's an investigation of the negative imagination. When I started this project called  On the Road  A Search For an American Character  with my tape recorder  I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects    bull riders  cowboys  pig farmers  drum majorettes    but I sort of got tripped on race relations  because my first big show was a show about a race riot. And so I went to both    two race riots  one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that. Because this is what I would say I've learned the most about race relations  from this piece. It's a kind of an aria  I would say  and in many tapes that I have. Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King. It was captured on videotape    technology    and it was played all over the world. Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail. They did not  so there were riots. And what a lot of people forget  is there was a second trial  ordered by George Bush  Sr. And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial. And I mean  the people just danced in the streets because they were afraid there was going to be another riot. Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way. So there was a community that didn't    the Korean Americans  whose stores had been burned to the ground. And so this woman  Mrs. Young Soon Han  I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race. And she asks also a question that Studs talks about  this notion of the  official truth   to question the  official truth.  So what she's questioning here  she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society. And this is called   Swallowing the Bitterness.   I used to believe America was the best. I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie. I never saw any poor man  any black. Until       I used to believe America was the best    I still do  I don't deny that because I am a victim. But at the end of '    when we were in such turmoil  and having all the financial problems  and all the mental problems  I began to really realize that Koreans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing. Why  Why do we have to be left out  We didn't qualify for medical treatment  no food stamp  no GR  no welfare  anything. Many African Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive. We didn't get any because we have a car and a house. And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice   OK. OK  OK. OK. Many African Americans probably think that they won by the trial. I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict  and all the day they were having a party  they celebrated  all of South Central  all the churches. And they say  'Well  finally justice has been done in this society.' Well  what about victims' rights  They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants. They have a lot of respect  as I do  for Dr. Martin King. He is the only model for black community  I don't care Jesse Jackson. He is the model of non violence  non violence    and they would all like to be in his spirit.  But what about       They destroyed innocent people. And I wonder if that is really justice for them  to get their rights in that way. I was swallowing the bitterness  sitting here alone and watching them. They became so hilarious  but I was happy for them. I was glad for them. At least they got something back  OK. Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them. They fought for their rights for over two centuries  and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities  Hispanic  Asian  we would suffer more in the mainstream. That's why I understand  that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.  But I wish that  I wish that  I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment. I wish that I could live together with black people. But after the riot  it's too much difference. The fire is still there. How do you say it   Unclear . Igniting  igniting  igniting fire. Igniting fire. It's still there  it can burst out anytime.  Mrs. Young Soon Han. The other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody  walking really in somebody else's shoes. And I told you that in    you know  I didn't give you the year  but in '   I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that  and I got sidetracked on race relations. Finally  I did find a bull rider  two years ago. And I've been going to the rodeos with him  and we've bonded. And he's the lead in an op ed I did about the Republican Convention. He's a Republican    I won't say anything about my party affiliation  but anyway    so this is my dear  dear Brent Williams  and this is on toughness  in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this. And this is called  Toughness.   Well  I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist. I mean  you know  I mean  it's like my wife  Jolene  her family's always saying  you know  you ever think he's just a born loser  It seems like he has so much bad luck  you know. But then when that bull stepped on my kidney  you know  I didn't lose my kidney    I could have lost my kidney  I kept my kidney  so I don't think I'm a born loser. I think that's good luck.  And  I mean  funny things like this happen. I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan  and there was a Reader's Digest  October     . It was like  'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says if you want to get lucky  you know  you've got to be around positive people. I mean  like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me  she's like  'She's just talking  she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'  And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet. She said  'Look who she is. You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.' And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because I've never been to college  and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything. I said  'Well look  the woman talked to me for four hours. You know  if I wasn't talking    you know  like  you know  she wanted me to talk  I don't think she would even come out here.'  Confidence  Well  I think I ride more out of determination than confidence. I mean  confidence is like  you know  you've been on that bull before  you know you can ride him. I mean  confidence is kind of like being cocky  but in a good way. But determination  you know  it's like just  you know  'Fuck the form  get the horn.' That's Tuff Hedeman  in the movie '  Seconds.' I mean  like  Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy  he say  'You know  you got more try than any kid I ever seen.' And try and determination is the same thing. Determination is  like  you're going to hang on that bull  even if you're riding upside down. Determination's like  you're going to ride till your head hits the back of the dirt.  Freedom  It would have to be the rodeo.  Beauty  I don't think I know what beauty is. Well  you know  I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too. I mean  look how we are  the roughy family  palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me. It's like  you know  racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas. We ride together  we  you know  we  we eat together and we sleep together. I mean  I can't even imagine what it's going to be like the last day I rodeo. I mean  I'll be alright. I mean  I have my ranch and everything  but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes. I mean  I guess it just be like    I guess it be like the day my brother died.  Toughness  Well  we was in West Jordan  Utah  and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a    you know  busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital. And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out. And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night  so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia  or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up. And then they had to straighten out my nose  and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head  and everybody said that it should have killed me  but it didn't  because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain. But the good thing was  once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out  I could breathe  and I hadn't been able to breathe since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo.  Thank you. So anyway  who am I  I usually say to people  when they say   What do you do   I say   I do hardware   because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do. And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event  to which he replied   How quaint.  And I sort of really was dumbstruck. And I really should have said something smart. And now I've had a little bit of time to think about it  I would have said   Well  you know  if we look at the next     years and we've seen all these problems in the last few days  most of the big issues    clean water  clean energy    and they're interchangeable in some respects    and cleaner  more functional materials    they all look to me to be hardware problems. This doesn't mean we should ignore software  or information  or computation.  And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about. So  this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future. Now  TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker about  do this  do that  and you fill out all these forms  and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you  and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist. And I've always been nervous about the term  futurist   because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it. And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have  and said   You know  well  if I have to talk about the future  what is it   And George Homsey  a great guy  said   Oh  the future is amazing. It is so much stranger than you think. We're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut  and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint.  So  you may think that's sort of really crazy  but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible. So  this isn't my work  but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT. This is called the registry of standard biological parts. This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very  very bright individuals. Basically  what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system. Literally  think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program. Now  this is actually becoming such an interesting idea. This is a state diagram. That's an extremely simple computer. This one is a two bit counter. So that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches. And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology. And from the results of the same competition last year  a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off. So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do  if then for  statements in materials  in structure. This is a pretty interesting trend  because we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly   Form follows function   but I think I've sort of grown up in a world    you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday  I was in a lab associated with his    where it's really a world where information defines form and function. I spent six years thinking about that  but to show you the power of art over science    this is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called  HowToons.  I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta. Took me six years at MIT  and about that many pages to describe what I was doing  and it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker. He's an interesting little kid    and his sister  Celine    and what he's doing here is observing the self assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl. And in fact you can program the self assembly of things  so he starts chocolate dipping edges  changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity. In theory  if you program those sufficiently  you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure. In this case  he's done self replication of a complex  D structure. And that's what I thought about for a long time  because this is how we currently make things. This is a silicon wafer  and essentially that's just a whole bunch of layers of two dimensional stuff  sort of layered up. The feature side is    you know  people will say   unclear  down around about    nanometers now. On the right  that's a radiolara. That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans. And that has feature sizes down to about    nanometers  and it's a complex  D structure. We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way. The secret to biology is  it builds computation into the way it makes things. So this little thing here  polymerase  is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA. And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins. I thought about this in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials  but can we do similar things  Can we get self replicating type behavior  Can we get complex  D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems  Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems  like higher speed semiconductors  etc. So  this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self replicating system. And this is sort of Babbage's revenge. These are little mechanical computers. These are five state state machines. So  that's about three light switches lined up. In a neutral state  they won't bind at all. Now  if I make a string of these  a bit string  they will be able to replicate. So we start with white  blue  blue  white. That encodes  that will now copy. From one comes two  and then from two comes three. And so you've got this sort of replicating system. It was work actually by Lionel Penrose  father of Roger Penrose  the tiles guy. He did a lot of this work in the '  s  and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution  but it's now coming back. So now I'm going to show you the hands free  autonomous self replication. So we've tracked in the video the input string  which was green  green  yellow  yellow  green. We set them off on this air hockey table. You know  high science uses air hockey tables       and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy  but what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here. So we've got autonomous replication of bit strings. So  why would you want to replicate bit strings  Well  it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme  that you can take a linear string  which is a convenient thing to copy  and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex  D structure. So I was trying to  you know  take the engineer's version  Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing  So what I'm showing you here is that we can make a  D shape    the B    assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules. And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here  and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design  was that you don't need digital logic to do computation. And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips. So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process. So  Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday  I believe  but I'll show you again. This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles. Each different color has a different magnetic polarity  and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out. Now  hopefully  those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that  and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary  D structure  and in fact  you know  I can now take a dog  carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. And now I can actually define that three dimensional object as a sequence of bits. So  you know  it's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently. And the universe is now a compiler. And so I'm thinking about  you know  what are the programs for programming the physical universe  And how do we think about materials and structure  sort of as an information and computation problem  Not just where you attach a micro controller to the end point  but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic  are the computers. Having totally absorbed this philosophy  I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently. With the universe as a computer  you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations. You set a couple of boundary conditions  like gravity  the surface tension  density  etc.  and then you press  execute   and magically  the universe produces you a perfect ball lens. So  this actually applied to the problem of    so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world don't have access to cheap eyeglasses. So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site  This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition. If it's circular  you make a spherical lens. If it's elliptical  you can make an astigmatic lens. You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure    so that's part of the extra program. And literally with only those two inputs    so  the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure    you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error  from minus    to plus eight diopters  up to four diopters of cylinder. And then literally  you now pour on a monomer. You know  I'll do a Julia Childs here. This is three minutes of UV light. And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it. Pop it out. I've seen this video  but I still don't know if it's going to end right. So you reverse this. This is a very old movie  so with the new prototypes  actually both surfaces are flexible  but this will show you the point. Now you've finished the lens  you literally pop it out. That's next year's Yves Klein  you know  eyeglasses shape. And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters. And as I rotate it against this side shot  you'll see that that has cylinder  and that was programmed in    literally into the physics of the system. So  this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things  like this. This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment  called  electronic rope.  So literally  you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave. And under no load  it's one structure. Under a different load  it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor. So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope. Just by thinking about the physics of the world  materials as the computer  you can start to do things like this. I'm going to segue a little here. I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this. One thing I'm really interested about this right now is  how  if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer  how do we make things in a very general sense  and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware  And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems  share the information and work on those things together. So  a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time  and unless Lisa Randall changes that  we'll continue to move in linear time. So that means anything you do  or anything you make  you produce a sequence of steps    and I think Lego in the '  s nailed this  and they did it most elegantly. But they can show you how to build things in sequence. So  I'm thinking about  how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things  so you end up with this sort of guy  right  And I think this applies across a very broad    sort of  a lot of concepts. You know  Cameron Sinclair yesterday said   How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity   And if you've seen Amy Smith  she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti. And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things  so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other's source code for structure. I don't know exactly how to do this yet  but  you know  it's something being actively thought about. So  you know  that leads to questions like  is this a compiler  Is this a sub routine  Interesting things like that. Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract  but you know  this is the sort of    returning to our comic characters    this is sort of the universe  or a different universe view  that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future    from biotech to materials assembly. It was great to hear Bill Joy. They're starting to invest in materials science  but these are the new things in materials science. How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas  and see the world in a different way  And it's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe    it's sort of an analog computer. But it's definitely an interesting new worldview. I've gone too far. So that sounds like it's it. I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions  or I can show    I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction  so I may have to explain that. So maybe I'll do that with this short video. So this is actually a       square foot kite  which also happens to be a minimal energy surface. So returning to the droplet  again  thinking about the universe in a new way. This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp. And why do you want a       square foot kite  So that's a kite the size of your house. And so you want that to tow boats very fast. So I've been working on this a little  also  with a couple of other guys. But  you know  this is another way to look at the    if you abstract again  this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe. You could just hang it as a bed sheet  but again  the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape. And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future. This meeting has really been about a digital revolution  but I'd like to argue that it's done  we won. We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it. And I'd like to look after that  to look what comes after the digital revolution. So  let me start projecting forward. These are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT  looking what comes after computers. This first one  Internet Zero  up here    this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag    about a dollar    that can go in every light bulb and doorknob  and this is getting commercialized very quickly. And what's interesting about it isn't the cost  it's the way it encodes the Internet. It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet so you could send it optically  you can communicate acoustically through a power line  through RF. It takes the original principle of the Internet  which is inter networking computers  and now lets devices inter network. That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero  this internet of devices. So this is the next step from there to here  and this is getting commercialized today. A step after that is a project on fungible computers. Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded. So  half as much grain is half as much useful  but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer  and we've been trying to make computers that work that way. So  what you see in the background is a prototype. This was from a thesis of a student  Bill Butow  now at Intel  who wondered why  instead of making bigger and bigger chips  you don't make small chips  put them in a viscous medium  and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch. And that's what you see here. On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer  on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made  but there's no frame buffer  IO processor  any of that stuff    it's just this material. Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully  this is a raw material. If you add twice as much of it  you have twice as much display. If you shoot a gun through the middle  nothing happens. If you need more resource  you just apply more computer. So  that's the step after this    of computing as a raw material. That's still conventional bits  the step after that is    this is an earlier prototype in the lab  this is high speed video slowed down. Now  integrating chemistry in computation  where the bits are bubbles. This is showing making bits  this is showing    once again  slowed down so you can see it  bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de multiplexing. So  now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information. And  ultimately  these are some slides from an early project I did  computing where the bits are stored quantum mechanically in the nuclei of atoms  so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules. All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further  not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms  and they lead to the following recognition. We all know we've had a digital revolution  but what is that  Well  Shannon took us  in the '  s  from here to here  from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem  that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal  you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device. And that's when we got the Internet. Von Neumann  in the '  s  did the same thing for computing  he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT  a differential analyzer  and the more you ran it  the worse the answer got. After Von Neumann  we have the Pentium  where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one. But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner. A state of the art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal  or you maybe melt some plastic. A    billion dollar chip fab uses a process a village artisan would recognize    you spread stuff around and bake it. All the intelligence is external to the system  the materials don't have information. Yesterday you heard about molecular biology  which fundamentally computes to build. It's an information processing system. We've had digital revolutions in communication and computation  but precisely the same idea  precisely the same math Shannon and Von Neuman did  hasn't yet come out to the physical world. So  inspired by that  colleagues in this program    the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT    which is a group of people  like me  who never understood the boundary between physical science and computer science. I would even go further and say computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science       because the canon    computer science    many of them are great but the canon of computer science prematurely froze a model of computation based on technology that was available in       and nature's a much more powerful computer than that. So  you'll hear  tomorrow  from Saul Griffith. He was one of the first students to emerge from this program. We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate. This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically  where you write a code  much like protein folding  that specifies their structure. So  there's no feedback to a tool metrology  the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated. So  you can  for example  do that. You can do other things. That's in  D. It works in  D. The video on the upper right    I won't show for time    shows self replication  templating so something can make something that can make something  and we're doing that now over  maybe  nine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism  in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails that code for their assembly    so  much like the magnets  but now on nanometer scales. Laser micro machining  essentially  D printers that digitally fabricate functional systems  all the way up to building buildings  not by having blueprints  but having the parts code for the structure of the building. So  these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools but computers that are tools  where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits. Now  to do that    with your tax dollars  thank you    I bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal to the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale  all in one place  because you can't segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale. So we put together focused nano beam writers and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro machining systems. But I had a problem. Once I had all these machines  I was spending too much time teaching students to use them. So I started teaching a class  modestly called   How To Make Almost Anything.  And that wasn't meant to be provocative  it was just for a few research students. But the first day of class looked like this. You know  hundreds of people came in begging  all my life I've been waiting for this class  I'll do anything to do it. Then they'd ask  can you teach it at MIT  It seems too useful  And then the next       surprising thing was they weren't there to do research. They were there because they wanted to make stuff. They had no conventional technical background. At the end of a semester they integrated their skills. I'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor  and this is what she did with her semester project. Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream  but you can't because you're at work  or you're in a classroom  or you're watching your children  or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted  Well  scream buddy is a portable space for screaming. When a user screams into scream buddy  their scream is silenced. It is also recorded for later release where  when and how the user chooses. So  Einstein would like this. This student made a web browser for parrots    lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots. This student's made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you're awake  this is one that defends    a dress that defends your personal space. This isn't technology for communication  it's technology to prevent it. This is a device that lets you see your music. This is a student who made a machine that makes machines  and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing. Just year after year    and I finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication is products for a market of one person. You don't need this for what you can get in Wal Mart  you need this for what makes you unique. Ken Olsen famously said  nobody needs a computer in the home. But you don't use it for inventory and payroll  DEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it. You need it for what makes you unique  just like personalization. So  with that  in turn     million dollars today does this     years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything. The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication. Today  when you spend that much of your money  there's a government requirement to do outreach  which often means classes at a local school  a website    stuff that's just not that exciting. So  I made a deal with my NSF program managers that instead of talking about it  I'd give people the tools. This wasn't meant to be provocative or important  but we put together these Fab Labs. It's about        dollars in equipment that approximate both what the    million dollars does and where it's going. A laser cutter to do press fit assembly with  D from  D  a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics  a micron scale  numerically controlled milling machine for precise structures  programming tools for less than a dollar      nanosecond microcontrollers. It lets you work from microns and microseconds on up  and they exploded around the world. This wasn't scheduled  but they went from inner city Boston to Pobal in India  to Secondi Takoradi on Ghana's coast to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa  to the far north of Norway  uncovering  or helping uncover  for all the attention to the digital divide  we would find unused computers in all these places. A farmer in a rural village    a kid needs to measure and modify the world  not just get information about it on a screen. That there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide bigger than the digital divide. And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses. So  in place after place we saw this same progression  that we'd open one of these Fab Labs  where we didn't    this is too crazy to think of. We didn't think this up  that we would get pulled to these places  we'd open it. The first step was just empowerment. You can see it in their face  just this joy of  I can do it. This is a girl in inner city Boston who had just done a high tech on demand craft sale in the inner city community center. It goes on from there to serious hands on technical education informally  out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs. We designed a network sensor  and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab. There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night       her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor. So she insisted on fabbing the board  learning how to stuff it  learning how to program it. She didn't really know what she was doing or why she was doing it  but she knew she just had to do it. There was something electric about it. This is late at  you know     o'clock at night and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time. And I've shown this to engineers at big companies  and they say they can't do this. Any one thing she's doing  they can do better  but it's distributed over many people and many sites and they can't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing. I made a stacking board. And  again  that was just for the joy of it. Then these labs started doing serious problem solving    instrumentation for agriculture in India  steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana  high gain antennas in thin client computers. And then  in turn  businesses started to grow  like making these antennas. And finally  the lab started doing invention. We're learning more from them than we're giving them. I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it. They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box    which  as you see up there  that's becoming a business    but their design was better than Saul's design at MIT  so there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on scaling the work of eight year old children because they had better designs. Real invention is happening in these labs. And I still kept    so  in the last year I've been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this  and I keep saying  but this isn't the real thing. Wait  like     years and then we'll be done. And I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie inventing UNIX on a PDP. PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers. They were tens of thousands of dollars  hard to use  but they brought computing down to work groups  and everything we do today happened there. These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP. The projection of digital fabrication isn't a projection for the future  we are now in the PDP era. We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then. It was very chaotic  it wasn't  sort of  clear what was going on. In the same sense we are now  today  in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication. The only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries. In DC  I go to every agency that wants to talk  you know  in the Bay Area  I go to every organization you can think of    they all want to talk about it  but it breaks their organizational boundaries. In fact  it's illegal for them  in many cases  to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology. And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention coming from this community surprised me  it's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway    this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground rather than the sky because that's where the satellites are    the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in. It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it  so they built this extraordinary village for the lab. This isn't a university  it's not a company. It's essentially a village for invention  it's a village for the outliers in society  and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs all around the world. So this program has split into an NGO foundation  a Fab Foundation to support the scaling  a micro VC fund. The person who runs it nicely describes it as  machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses   it's a cross between micro finance and VC to do fan out  and then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's making it possible. So I'd like to leave you with two thoughts. There's been a sea change in aid  from top down mega projects to bottom up  grassroots  micro finance investing in the roots  so that everybody's got that that's what works. But we still look at technology as top down mega projects. Computing  communication  energy for the rest of the planet are these top down mega projects. If this room full of heroes is just clever enough  you can solve the problems. The message coming from the Fab Labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks  they're sources. The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems. I thought that's the projection    years hence into the future  but it's where we are today. It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of. The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering  but it's here today. And  finally  any talk like this on the future of computing is required to show Moore's law  but my favorite version    this is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper    and what's happened is  year after year after year  we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled  and we've scaled and we've scaled  and we've scaled and we've scaled  and there's this looming bug of what's going to happen at the end of Moore's law  this ultimate bug is coming. But we're coming to appreciate  is the transition from  D to  D  from programming bits to programming atoms  turns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature. So  we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication  where the output of computation programs the physical world. So  together  these two projects answer questions I hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app for personal fabrication in the developed world is technology for a market of one  personal expression in technology that touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology for a very long time. And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide  people locally developing solutions to local problems. Thank you. What I'd like to start off with is an observation  which is that if I've learned anything over the last year  it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast. I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city  studio to studio  interview to interview  serving up the book in really tiny bite size chunks. Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down  but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ... so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air. And I think that    that's not really surprising though  is it  Because that's kind of the world that we live in now  a world stuck in fast forward. A world obsessed with speed  with doing everything faster  with cramming more and more into less and less time. Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock. To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher  which is in my bio there  I'll just toss it out again     These days even instant gratification takes too long.   Laughter  And if you think about how we to try to make things better  what do we do  No  we speed them up  don't we  So we used to dial  now we speed dial. We used to read  now we speed read. We used to walk  now we speed walk. And of course  we used to date and now we speed date. And even things that are by their very nature slow    we try and speed them up too. So I was in New York recently  and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course  a new evening course. And it was for  you guessed it  speed yoga. So this    the perfect solution for time starved professionals who want to  you know  salute the sun  but only want to give over about    minutes to it. I mean  these are sort of the extreme examples  and they're amusing and good to laugh at. But there's a very serious point  and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life  we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us. We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives    on our health  our diet  our work  our relationships  the environment and our community. And sometimes it takes a wake up call  doesn't it  to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives  instead of actually living them  that we're living the fast life  instead of the good life. And I think for many people  that wake up call takes the form of an illness. You know  a burnout  or eventually the body says   I can't take it anymore   and throws in the towel. Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time  or the patience  or the tranquility  to be with the other person  to listen to them. And my wake up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son  and I found that at the end of day  I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down    you know  I'd be speed reading  The Cat In The Hat.  I'd be    you know  I'd be skipping lines here  paragraphs there  sometimes a whole page  and of course  my little boy knew the book inside out  so we would quarrel. And what should have been the most relaxing  the most intimate  the most tender moment of the day  when a dad sits down to read to his son  became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills  a clash between my speed and his slowness. And this went on for some time  until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people. And one of them made reference to a series of books called  The One Minute Bedtime Story.  And I wince saying those words now  but my first reaction at the time was very different. My first reflex was to say   Hallelujah    what a great idea  This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more.  But thankfully  a light bulb went on over my head  and my next reaction was very different  and I took a step back  and I thought   Whoa    you know  has it really come to this  Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day   And I put away the newspaper    and I was getting on a plane    and I sat there  and I did something I hadn't done for a long time    which is I did nothing. I just thought  and I thought long and hard. And by the time I got off that plane  I'd decided I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture  and what it was doing to me and to everyone else. And I had two questions in my head. The first was  how did we get so fast  And the second is  is it possible  or even desirable  to slow down  Now  if you think about how our world got so accelerated  the usual suspects rear their heads. You think of  you know  urbanization  consumerism  the workplace  technology. But I think if you cut through those forces  you get to what might be the deeper driver  the nub of the question  which is how we think about time itself. In other cultures  time is cyclical. It's seen as moving in great  unhurried circles. It's always renewing and refreshing itself. Whereas in the West  time is linear. It's a finite resource  it's always draining away. You either use it  or lose it.  Time is money   as Benjamin Franklin said. And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation. Time is scarce  so what do we do  Well    well  we speed up  don't we  We try and do more and more with less and less time. We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line    a finish line  incidentally  that we never reach  but a finish line nonetheless. And I guess that the question is  is it possible to break free from that mindset  And thankfully  the answer is yes  because what I discovered  when I began looking around  that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better  and that busier is best. Right across the world  people are doing the unthinkable  they're slowing down  and finding that  although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down  you're road kill  the opposite turns out to be true  that by slowing down at the right moments  people find that they do everything better. They eat better  they make love better  they exercise better  they work better  they live better. And  in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration  lie what a lot of people now refer to as the  International Slow Movement.  Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy  I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food  many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement. Started in Italy  but has spread across the world  and now has         members in    countries. And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message  which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate  cook and consume it at a reasonable pace. I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement  and the renaissance of farmers' markets  are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable. They want to get back to slower rhythms. And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement  which has started in Italy  but has spread right across Europe and beyond. And in this  towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape  so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another. So they might curb traffic  or put in a park bench  or some green space. And in some ways  these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts  because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City  it's kind of like a philosophical declaration. It's saying to the rest of world  and to the people in that town  that we believe that in the   st century  slowness has a role to play. In medicine  I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine. And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine  which tend to tap into sort of slower  gentler  more holistic forms of healing. Now  obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies  and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever  you know  gain mainstream approval. But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage  and even just relaxation  clearly have some kind of benefit. And blue chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work  and what we might learn from them. Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around  isn't there  I was coming to    well    no pun intended there. I was making my way  let's say  slowly to Oxford  and I went through a news agent  and I saw a magazine  a men's magazine  and it said on the front   How to bring your partner to orgasm in    seconds.  So  you know  even sex is on a stopwatch these days. Now  you know  I like a quickie as much as the next person  but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex    from slowing down in the bedroom. You know  you tap into that    those deeper  sort of  psychological  emotional  spiritual currents  and you get a better orgasm with the buildup. You can get more bang for your buck  let's say. I mean  the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently  didn't they  when they sang the praises of  a lover with a slow hand.  Now  we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric  but you fast forward a few years  and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops  or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms  finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex. And of course  in Italy where    I mean  Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure    they've launched an official Slow Sex movement. The workplace. Right across much of the world    North America being a notable exception    working hours have been coming down. And Europe is an example of that  and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less  and also that their hourly productivity goes up. Now  clearly there are problems with the    hour workweek in France    too much  too soon  too rigid. But other countries in Europe  notably the Nordic countries  are showing that it's possible to have a kick ass economy without being a workaholic. And Norway  Sweden  Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth  and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy. And if you go beyond sort of the country level  down at the micro company level  more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug    to take a lunch break  or to go sit in a quiet room  to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops    you at the back    mobile phones  during the work day or on the weekend  so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought. It's not just  though  these days  adults who overwork  though  is it  It's children  too. I'm     and my childhood ended in the mid '  s  and I look at kids now  and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework  more tutoring  more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago. And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout  pleading with me to write to their parents  to help them slow down  to help them get off this full throttle treadmill. But thankfully  there is a backlash there in parenting as well  and you're finding that  you know  towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month  so that people can  you know  decompress and have some family time  and slow down. Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years  and now they're discovering that less can be more. So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee paying  high achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of     and the high achieving parents freaked out and said   What are you    you know  our kids will fall     the headmaster said   No  no  your children need to slow down at the end of the day.  And just this last month  the exam results came in  and in math  science  marks went up    percent on average last year. And I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities  who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much  are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks  they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars  to the point that would make your eyes water. But they lack spark  they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside    they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools  and Oxford and Cambridge and so on  are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit. And in Harvard  for instance  they send out a letter to undergraduates    freshmen    telling them that they'll get more out of life  and more out of Harvard  if they put on the brakes  if they do less  but give time to things  the time that things need  to enjoy them  to savor them. And even if they sometimes do nothing at all. And that letter is called    very revealing  I think     Slow Down      with an exclamation mark on the end. So wherever you look  the message  it seems to me  is the same  that less is very often more  that slower is very often better. But that said  of course  it's not that easy to slow down  is it  I mean  you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness  and that's true  but that's not all of it. I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time. And if that's not shaming enough  I got that ticket in Italy. And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway  you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going. But why is it so hard to slow down  I think there are various reasons. One is that speed is fun  you know  speed is sexy. It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up. I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension    that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger  deeper questions. We fill our head with distraction  with busyness  so that we don't have to ask  am I well  Am I happy  Are my children growing up right  Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf  Another reason    although I think  perhaps  the most powerful reason    why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.  Slow  is a dirty word in our culture. It's a byword for  lazy    slacker   for being somebody who gives up. You know   he's a bit slow.  It's actually synonymous with being stupid. I guess what the Slow Movement    the purpose of the Slow Movement  or its main goal  really  is to tackle that taboo  and to say that yes  sometimes slow is not the answer  that there is such a thing as  bad slow.  You know  I got stuck on the M    which is a ring road around London  recently  and spent three and a half hours there. And I can tell you  that's really bad slow. But the new idea  the sort of revolutionary idea  of the Slow Movement  is that there is such a thing as  good slow   too. And good slow is  you know  taking the time to eat a meal with your family  with the TV switched off. Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work. Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life. Now  one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out  is the reaction to it. And I knew that when my book on slowness came out  it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade  but it's also been taken up  with great gusto  by the corporate world    you know  business press  but also big companies and leadership organizations. Because people at the top of the chain  people like you  I think  are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system  there's too much busyness  and it's time to find  or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. Another encouraging sign  I think  is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world  in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status    China  Brazil  Thailand  Poland  and so on    these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement  many people in them  and there's a debate going on in their media  on the streets. Because I think they're looking at the West  and they're saying   Well  we like that aspect of what you've got  but we're not so sure about that.  So all of that said  is it  I guess  is it possible  That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible to slow down  And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes. And I present myself as Exhibit A  a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed aholic. I still love speed. You know  I live in London  and I work as a journalist  and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness  and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things. I play squash and ice hockey  two very fast sports  and I wouldn't give them up for the world. But I've also  over the last year or so  got in touch with my inner tortoise. And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously. My default mode is no longer to be a rush aholic. I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near  or at least not as much as I did before. I can actually hear it now  because I see my time is ticking off. And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier  healthier  more productive than I ever have. I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it. And perhaps  the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper  richer  stronger. And for me  I guess  the litmus test for whether this would work  and what it would mean  was always going to be bedtime stories  because that's sort of where the journey began. And there too the news is rosy. You know  at the end of the day  I go into my son's room. I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer  so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket  and I just slow down to his pace and we read. And because children have their own tempo and internal clock  they don't do quality time  where you schedule    minutes for them to open up to you. They need you to move at their rhythm. I find that    minutes into a story  you know  my son will suddenly say   You know  something happened in the playground today that really bothered me.  And we'll go off and have a conversation on that. And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to do list  something that I dreaded  because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly. It's become my reward at the end of the day  something I really cherish. And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon  which goes a little bit like this  a few months ago  I was getting ready to go on another book tour  and I had my bags packed. I was downstairs by the front door  and I was waiting for a taxi  and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it. He'd gone and stapled two cards  very like these  together  and put a sticker of his favorite character  Tintin  on the front. And he said to me  or he handed this to me  and I read it  and it said   To Daddy  love Benjamin.  And I thought   Aw  that's really sweet. Is that a good luck on the book tour card   And he said   No  no  no  Daddy    this is a card for being the best story reader in the world.  And I thought   Yeah  you know  this slowing down thing really does work.  Thank you very much.
