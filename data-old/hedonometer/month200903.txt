Back in       I started working for a company called Interval Research  which was just then being founded by David Lidell and Paul Allen as a for profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley. I met with David to talk about what I might do in his company. I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books    after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell. And David and I discovered that we had a question in common  that we really wanted the answer to  and that was   Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls   Why is that  It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy. These people aren't that smart. There's six billion dollars on the table. They would go for it if they could figure out how. So  what is the deal here  And as we thought about our goals    I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution  in the classical sense that humanism  at its best  finds a way to combine clear eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people. The basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life  that we can do good things  that there are things worth doing because they're good things to do  and that clear eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them. So  contrary to popular belief  there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values. And Interval Research is kind of the living example of how that can be true. So David and I decided to go find out  through the best research we could muster  what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer  to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games. We spent two and a half years conducting research  we spent another year and a half in advance development. Then we formed a spin off company. In the research phase of the project at Interval  we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research  and these people    Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland    changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be. They taught me how to look and see  and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child   Of all these things we already make you  which do you like best      which gives you zero answers that are usable. So  what we did for the first two and a half years was four things  We did an extensive review of the literature in related fields  like cognitive psychology  spatial cognition  gender studies  play theory  sociology  primatology. Thank you Frans de Waal  wherever you are  I love you and I'd give anything to meet you. After we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing    because  after all  that's really what this is about    we moved to the second phase of our work  where we interviewed adult experts in academia  some of the people who'd produced the literature that we found relevant. Also  we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day  like playground supervisors. We talked to them  confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions about gender difference and play. Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work  interviewed       children  boys and girls  ages seven to     all over the United States    except for Silicon Valley  Boston and Austin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a representative sample. And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States  after two years  we pulled together some survey data from another        children  drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research  and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics  for designing computer based products    and  in fact  any kind of products    for little girls  ages eight to   . And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software and testing them with little girls. In       in November  we formed the company Purple Moon which was a spinoff of Interval Research  and our chief investors were Interval Research  Vulcan Northwest  Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company. We launched a website on September  nd that has now served    million pages  and has        registered young girl users. They visit an average of one and a half times a day  spend an average of    minutes a visit  and look at    pages a visit. So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls. We launched two titles in October     Rockett's New School     the first of a series of products    is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place  with a blank slate  which allows girls to play with the question of   What will I be like when I'm older    What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school  Who are my friends    to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior  and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves. The other title that we launched is called  Secret Paths in the Forest   which addresses the more fantasy oriented  inner lives of girls. These two titles both showed up in the top    entertainment titles in PC Data    entertainment titles in PC Data in December  right up there with  John Madden Football   which thrills me to death. So  we're real  and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls. We've made half a billion impressions with marketing and PR for this brand  Purple Moon. Ninety six percent of them  roughly  have been positive  four percent of them have been  other.  I want to talk about the other  because the politics of this enterprise  in a way  have been the most fascinating part of it  for me. There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received. One kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be  and won't show the product to little girls. The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be. And so it's funny to me that these interesting  odd bedfellows have one thing in common  they don't listen to little girls. They haven't looked at children and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them. I'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two and a half years of research that we did    actually  some of the voices are more recent. And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives  of the things that they value and care about. These are pictures the girls themselves never saw  but they gave to us This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to those who want to do humanistic work. Girl    Yeah  my character is usually a tomboy. Hers is more into boys. Girl    Uh  yeah. Girl    We have    in the very beginning of the whole game  always we do this  we each have a piece of paper  we write down our name  our age    are we rich  very rich  not rich  poor  medium  wealthy  boyfriends  dogs  pets    what else    sisters  brothers  and all those. Girl    Divorced    parents divorced  maybe. Girl    This is my pretend  unclear  one. Girl    We make a school newspaper on the computer. Girl    For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers. Girl    Like  if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy  you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy. Girl    I run track  I played soccer  I play basketball  and I love a lot of things to do. And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation  like when I get Mondays and all those days off. Girl    Well  sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team    all this different stuff that I have to do  and sometimes it gets overwhelming. Girl    My friend Justine kinda took my friend Kelly  and now they're being mean to me. Girl     Well  sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters  or brother or sister  when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves. Girl     Because my older sister  she gets everything and  like  when I ask my mom for something  she'll say   No     all the time. But she gives my sister everything. Brenda Laurel  I want to show you  real quickly  just a minute of  Rockett's Tricky Decision   which went gold two days ago. Let's hope it's really stable. This is the second day in Rockett's life. The reason I'm showing you this is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar  now that you've listened to some girls' voices. And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them in the game that we've created. Miko  Hey Rockett  C'mere  Rockett  Hi Miko  What's going on  Miko  Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend  She asked me to make sure you knew about it. Nakilia invited Reuben too  but    Rockett  But what  Isn't he coming  Miko  I don't think so. I mean  I heard his band is playing at another party the same night. Rockett  Really  What other party  Girl  Max's party is going to be so cool  Whitney. He's invited all the best people. BL  I'm going to fast forward to the decision point because I know I don't have a lot of time. After this awful event occurs  Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it. Rockett  Who'd want to show up at that party anyway  I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to. Gee  I doubt I'll make Max's best people list. BL  OK  so we're going to emotionally navigate. If we were playing the game  that's what we'd do. If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters  we can go into this hidden hallway  and I'll quickly just show you the interface. We can  for example  go find Miko's locker and get some more information about her. Oops  I turned the wrong way. But you get the general idea of the product. I wanted to show you the ways  innocuous as they seem  in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls    their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility  and to play around with the social complexity of their lives. I want to make the point that what we're giving girls  I think  through this effort  is a kind of validation  a sense of being seen. And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives. We love them. We see them. We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be. But we're really  really happy about who they are. It turns out they're really great. I want to close by showing you a videotape that's a version of a future game in the Rockett series that our graphic artists and design people put together  that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.  Rockett      Rockett  It's like I'm just waking up  you know  BL  Thanks. I was walking in the market one day with my wife  and somebody stuck a cage in my face. And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I've ever seen. There was a very sick orangutan baby  my first encounter. That evening I came back to the market in the dark and I heard  uhh  uhh   and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap. Of course  the cage was salvaged. I took up the little baby  massaged her  forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally. This is Uce. She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain  and this is Matahari  her second son  which  by the way  is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued  Dodoy. That changed my life quite dramatically  and as of today  I have almost       babies in my two centers. No. No. No. Wrong. It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild. It's not good. This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing. Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together  just now like victims for every baby  six have disappeared from the forest. The deforestation  especially for oil palm  to provide biofuel for Western countries is what's causing these problems. And those are the peat swamp forests on    meters of peat  the largest accumulation of organic material in the world. When you open this for growing oil palms you're creating CO  volcanoes that are emitting so much CO  that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world  after China and the United States. And we don't have any industry at all    it's only because of this deforestation. And these are horrible images. I'm not going to talk too long about it  but there are so many of the family of Uce  which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest  that still have to go through that process. And I don't know anymore where to put them. So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests  to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing  in that way  the loss of habitat and all those victims. So I created the place Samboja Lestari  and the idea was  if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left  no one will have an excuse to say   Yeah  but ...  No. Everyone should be able to follow this. So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started. As you can see there's only yellow terrain. There's nothing left    just a bit of grass there. In      we had about    percent of the people jobless there. There was a huge amount of crime. People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water. There was no agricultural productivity left. This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife. This was like a biological desert. When I stood there in the grass  it's hot    not even the sound of insects    just this waving grass. Still  four years later we have created jobs for about       people. The climate has changed. I will show you  no more flooding  no more fires. It's no longer the poorest district  and there is a huge development of biodiversity. We've got over       species. We have     bird species as of today. We have    species of reptiles. So what happened here  We created a huge economic failure in this forest. So basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm. But we saw the same thing. We had slash and burn agriculture  people cannot afford the fertilizer  so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there  the fires become more frequent  and after a while you're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left. There are no trees left. Still  in this place  in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill  four years later  there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ... And there are all these animals  and all these people happy  and there's this economic value. So how's this possible  It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps  we bought the land  we dealt with the fire  and then only  we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry. Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary. But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that. The people would become the defenders of that forest. So we do the  people  profit  planet  principles  but we do it in addition to a sure legal status    because if the forest belongs to the state  people say   It belongs to me  it belongs to everyone.  And then we apply all these other principles like transparency  professional management  measurable results  scalability   unclear   etc. What we did was we formulated recipes    how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation. You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control  whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice. And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out. Now in this recipe you also have the cost. You also know how much labor is needed. If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil  on a clay soil  on a steep slope  on flat soil  you put those different recipes  if you combine them  out of that comes a business plan  comes a work plan  and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have  and you can do it. This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of. It exudes  unclear  like compounds from the roots. The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro climate  to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses. And after eight years they might actually yield some timber    that is  if you can preserve it in the right way  which we can do with bamboo peels. It's an old temple building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire susceptible. So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again. So we plant it later  along the waterways to filter the water  provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available. So the idea is  how to integrate these flows in space  over time and with the limited means you have. So we plant the trees  we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between  to reduce the competition for the trees  the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops  for the people  but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land  the system yields early income  the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money. So beautiful. What a theory. But is it really that easy  Not really  because if you looked at what happened in       the fire started. This is an area of about    million hectares. January. February. March. April. May. We lost  .  million hectares in just a matter of a few months. This is because we have        of those underground fires that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States. And once the soil gets dried  you're in a dry season    you get cracks  oxygen goes in  flames come out and the problem starts all over again. So how to break that cycle  Fire is the biggest problem. This is what it looked like for three months. For three months  the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark. We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year  they lost    IQ points. It was a disaster for orangutans and people. So these fires are really the first things to work on. That was why I put it as a single point up there. And you need the local people for that because these grasslands  once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall    going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there. So you have to do it with the local people. That is the short term solution but you also need a long term solution. So what we did is  we created a ring of sugar palms around the area. These sugar palms turn out to be fire resistant    also flood resistant  by the way    and they provide a lot of income for local people. This is what it looks like  the people have to tap them twice a day    just a millimeter slice    and the only thing you harvest is sugar water  carbon dioxide  rain fall and a little bit of sunshine. In principle  you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells. And you can create so much energy from this    they produce three times more energy per hectare per year  because you can tap them on a daily basis. You don't need to harvest  unclear  or any other of the crops. So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics  which is still unexploited  and doing it in combination with technology. But also your legal side needs to be in very good order. So we bought that land  and here is where we started our project    in the middle of nowhere. And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil  and we were actually monitoring  measuring every single tree in these       hectares        acres. And this forest is quite different. What I really did was I just followed nature  and nature doesn't know monocultures  but a natural forest is multilayered. That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light  it can store more carbon in the system  it can provide more functions. But  it's more complicated. It's not that simple  and you have to work with the people. So  just like nature  we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that  we grow the slower growing  primary grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light. Then  what is just as important  get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves  bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within    hours. And they become like nutrient pumps. You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen  and without those microorganisms  you won't have any performance at all. And then we started planting    only       trees a day. We could have planted many  many more  but we didn't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable. We didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation. And we do a lot of work here. We use indicator plants to look at what soil types  or what vegetables will grow  or what trees will grow here. And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space. This is what it looks like in reality  you have this irregular ring around it  with strips of     meters wide  with sugar palms that can provide income for     families. It's only a small part of the area. The nursery  in here  is quite different. If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe  for instance  from the Urals up to England  you know how many     . In this nursery  we're going to grow    times more than the number of species. Can you imagine  You do need to know what you are working with  but it's that diversity which makes it work. That you can go from this zero situation  by planting the vegetables and the trees  or directly  the trees in the lines in that grass there  putting up the buffer zone  producing your compost  and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used. In the beginning  maybe pineapples and beans and corn  in the second phase  there will be bananas and papayas  later on  there will be chocolate and chilies. And then slowly  the trees start taking over  bringing in produce from the fruits  from the timber  from the fuel wood. And finally  the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income. On the top left  underneath those green stripes  you see some white dots    those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space. And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before. So this is after one year. And this is after two years. And that's green. If you look from the tower    this is when we start attacking the grass. We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas  the papayas  all the crops for the local people  but the trees are growing up fast in between as well. And three years later      species of birds are living here. So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius. Air humidity is up    percent. Cloud cover    I'm going to show it to you    is up. Rainfall is up. And all these species and income. This ecolodge that I built here  three years before  was an empty  yellow field. This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency    it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture. Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon  how the forest is developing  and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation. We can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology. We actually have it already with Google Earth. If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks  and use Google Earth in combination with that  you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced  which company is stealing the timber  and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here. So this is the Samboja Lestari area. You measure how the trees grow back  but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back. And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced  how many medicines can be kept here. And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain. This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water  it's    percent surrounded by seawater  and we have now a lot of intrusion there. Now we looked at the clouds above this forest  we looked at the reforestation area  the semi open area and the open area. And look at these images. I'll just run them very quickly through. In the tropics  raindrops are not formed from ice crystals  which is the case in the temperate zones  you need the trees with  unclear   chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops. So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate  and you have the trees to initiate the rain. And look  there's now   .  percent more clouds    already  after three years. If you look at rainfall  it was already up    percent at that time. Let's look at the next year  and you can see that that trend is continuing. Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall  that cap is now widening and getting higher. And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari  it used to be the driest place  but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there. So you can actually change the climate. When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears  but afterwards  as soon as the wind stabilizes  you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area. So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do  because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies. And it's nice to have the science  but it still depends mostly upon the people  on your education. We have our farmer schools. But the real success of course  is our band    because if a baby is born  we will play  so everyone's our family and you don't make trouble with your family. This is how it looks. We have this road going around the area  which brings the people electricity and water from our own area. We have the zone with the sugar palms  and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans    that we provide with a place to live in the middle    and the people apart. And inside  we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive  because for the last    years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared. All the seeds get eaten. So now we do the monitoring on the inside    from towers  satellites  ultralights. Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back. And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees    you have the shade trees planted in year one  then you underplanted with the sugar palms  and you plant this thorny fence. And after a few years  you can remove some of those shade trees. The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel  and they can build a house  they have some fuel wood to cook with. And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like. They have enough income for three families. But whatever you do in that program  it has to be fully supported by the people  meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local  cultural values. There is no simple one recipe for one place. You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt    that it's transparent. Like here  in Samboja Lestari  we divide that ring in groups of    families. If one member trespasses the agreement  and does cut down trees  the other    members have to decide what's going to happen to him. If the group doesn't take action  the other    groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them. In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative    they have a democratic culture there  so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system. In summary  if you look at it  in year one the people can sell their land to get income  but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation  the working with the orangutans  and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft. They also get free land in between the trees  where they can grow their crops. They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project. They get building material for houses  a contract for selling the sugar  so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally. They get all these other benefits  environmentally  money  they get education    it's a great deal. And everything is based upon that one thing    make sure that forest remains there. So if we want to help the orangutans    what I actually set out to do    we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit. Now I think the real key to doing it  to give a simple answer  is integration. I hope    if you want to know more  you can read more. Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature  their complex structure  the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty. I used to climb trees for fun all the time and now  as a grown up  I have made my profession understanding trees and forests  through the medium of science. The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy. And Dr. Terry Erwin  in       called the canopy   the last biotic frontier.  I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy  and share with you what canopy researchers are asking and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science. Let's start our journey on the forest floor of one of my study sites in Costa Rica. Because of the overhanging leaves and branches  you'll notice that the understory is very dark  it's very still. And what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy  not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses  but rather showing you a very short clip from a National Geographic film called  Heroes of the High Frontier.  This was filmed in Monteverde  Costa Rica and I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like to climb a giant strangler fig. So what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field  and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted to make their way and their life in the canopy. Common groups  like the sloth here  have clear adaptations for forest canopies  hanging on with their very strong claws. But I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity and tell you about the ants. There are        species of ants that taxonomists    people who describe and name animals    have named.       of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy. One of the reasons I tell you about ants is because of my husband  who is in fact an ant taxonomist and when we got married  he promised to name an ant after me  which he did    Procryptocerus nalini  a canopy ant. We've had two children  August Andrew and Erika and actually  he named ants after them. So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us. But my passion    in addition to Jack and my children    are the plants  the so called epiphytes  those plants that grow up on trees. They don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor. But rather  it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog. These plants occur in great diversity  over        species around the world. They grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests  that we find in Washington state. These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses. One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes  as they die and decompose  they actually construct an arboreal soil  both in the temperate zone and in the tropics. And these mosses  generated by decomposing  are like peat moss in your garden. They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water. One of the surprising things I discovered is that  if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes  what you'll find underneath them are connections  networks of what we call canopy roots. These are not epiphyte roots  these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves. And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor. I was interested  and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest. We've done stripping experiments where we've removed mats of epiphytes and looked at the rates of recolonization. We had predicted that they would grow back very quickly and that they would come in encroaching from the side. What we found  however  was that they took an extremely long time    over    years    to regenerate  starting from the bottom and growing up. And even now  after    years  they're not up there  they have not recolonized completely. And I use this little image to say this is what happens to mosses. If it's gone  it's gone  and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom. So  recolonization is really very slow. These canopy communities are fragile. Well  when we look out  you and I  over that canopy of the intact primary forest  what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon. One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered. We know it's a lot  but we do not yet know the answers to how much  and by what processes  carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere  held in its biomass  and moving on through the ecosystem. So I hope I've showed you that canopy dwellers are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy that Tarzan and Jane were interested in  but rather that they foster biodiversity contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles  and they also help to keep our global climate stable. Up in the canopy  if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems  you would also see scenes like this. Scenes of forest destruction  forest harvesting and forest fragmentation  thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans. I've also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives. People who grew up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees and forests  as I did when I was a young girl. This troubles me. Here in       you know  it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist  gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them. And especially  you know  as a small brown woman in a little college  in the upper northwest part of our country  far away from the areas of power and money  I really have to ask myself   What can I do about this  How can I reconnect people with trees   Well  I think that I can do something. I know that as a scientist  I have information and as a human being  I can communicate with anybody  inside or outside of academia. And so  that's what I've begin doing  and so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here. We consult to the media about canopy questions  we have a canopy newsletter  we have an email LISTSERV. And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy  the beauty of the canopy  the necessity of intact canopies  to people outside of academia. We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make    those videos and so forth    you know  they don't reach everybody  and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia  and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to. Treetop Barbie is a great example of that. What we do  my students in my lab and I  is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village  we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses and we send her out with a canopy handbook. And my feeling is    Thank you.    that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing. We've also made partnerships with artists  with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty of trees and forest canopies. And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects  which is the generation of Canopy Confluences. What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds  and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms  and we look at nature  we look at trees  we look at the canopy  and we communicate  and exchange  and express what we see together. The results have been fantastic. I'll just give you a few examples. This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department at Rhode Island School of Design. He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences in the Pacific Northwest  and created this beautiful sculpture. We've had dance people up in the canopy. Jodi Lomask  and her wonderful troupe Capacitor  joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica. They made a fabulous dance called  Biome.  They danced in the forest  and we are taking this dance  my scientific outreach communications  and also linking up with environmental groups  to go to different cities and to perform the science  the dance and the environmental outreach that we hope will make a difference. We brought musicians to the canopy  and they made their music    and it's fantastic music. We had wooden flutists  we had oboists  we had opera singers  we had guitar players  and we had rap singers. And I brought a little segment to give you of Duke Brady's  Canopy Rap.  This experience of working with Duke also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science. I saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth    an audience  you know  I as a middle aged professor  I don't have a hope of getting to    in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands. So I engaged Caution  this rap singer  with a group of young people from inner city Tacoma. We went out to the forest  I would pick up a branch  Caution would rap on it  and suddenly that branch was really cool. And then the students would come into our sound studios  they would make their own rap songs with their own beats. They ended up making a CD which they took home to their family and friends  thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium. The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart  and it involves an economic and social value that is associated with epiphytic plants. In the Pacific Northwest  there's a whole industry of moss harvesting from old growth forests. These mosses are taken from the forest  they're used by the floriculture industry  by florists  to make arrangements and make hanging baskets. It's a     million dollar industry and it's increasing rapidly. If you remember that bald guy  you'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the Pacific Northwest old growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back. So this whole industry is unsustainable. What can I  as an ecologist  do about that  Well  my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses  and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild. And I thought  if I had some partners that could help me with this  that would be great. And so  I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women    who don't have access to nature  who often have a lot of time  they often have space  and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses    would be great partners. And they have become excellent partners. The best I can imagine. They were very enthusiastic. They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work. They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses  which  to tell you the truth  is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do. And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses. We've been successful as partners in figuring out which species grow the fastest  and I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been. Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well  I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons. I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison. We gave talks once a month  and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons    organic gardens  worm culture  recycling  water catchment and beekeeping.  Applause  Our latest endeavor  with a grant from the Department of Corrections at Washington state  they've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons. And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon. So they will raise them    in captivity  of course    from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs. And they will have the pleasure  many of them  of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop  helped nurture  move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild. And so  I think for many reasons    ecological  social  economic and perhaps even spiritual    this has been a tremendous project and I'm really looking forward to not only myself and my students doing it  but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this. As many of you are aware  the world of academia is a rather inward looking one. I'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community. And so I'm hoping that my husband Jack  the ant taxonomist  can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken. Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together and make an opera about AIDS. Or perhaps Al Gore and Naturally   could make a song about climate change that would really make you clap your hands. So  although it's a little bit of a fantasy  I think it's also a reality. Given the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times  it is time for scientists to reach outward  and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well. I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science. By making these partnerships that I described to you  I have really opened my mind and  I have to say  my heart to have a greater understanding  to make other discoveries about nature and myself. When I look into my heart  I see trees    this is actually an image of a real heart    there are trees in our hearts  there are trees in your hearts. When we come to understand nature  we are touching the most deep  the most important parts of our self. In these partnerships  I have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into IT people  and movie star people  and scientists  but when we share nature  when we share our perspectives about nature  we find a common denominator. Finally  as a scientist and as a person and now  as part of the TED community  I feel that I have better tools to go out to trees  to go out to forests  to go out to nature  to make new discoveries about nature    and about humans' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are. Thank you very much. The  Dirty Jobs  crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado  called Craig. It's only a couple dozen square miles. It's in the Rockies. And the job in question was sheep rancher. My role on the show  for those of you who haven't seen it    it's pretty simple. I'm an apprentice  and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question. And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people  for one day in their life. The job in question  herding sheep. Great. We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work. So  normally  I never do any research at all. But  this is a touchy subject  and I work for the Discovery Channel  and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do  and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals. So I called the Humane Society and I say   Look  I'm going to be castrating some lambs  Can you tell me the deal   And they're like   Yeah  it's pretty straightforward.  They use a band    basically a rubber band  like this  only a little smaller. This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday  but it had a certain familiarity to it. And I said   Well  what exactly is the process   And they said   The band is applied to the tail  tightly. And then another band is applied to the scrotum  tightly. Blood flow is slowly retarded  a week later the parts in question fall off.  Great    got it.  OK  I call the SPCA to confirm this    they confirm it. I also call PETA  just for fun  and they don't like it    but they confirm it. OK  that's basically how you do it. So the next day I go out. And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built  and we go about the business of animal husbandry. Melanie is the wife of Albert. Albert is the shepherd in question. Melanie picks up the lamb    two hands    one hand on both legs on the right  likewise on the left. Lamb goes on the post  she opens it up. Alright. Great. Albert goes in  I follow Albert  the crew is around. I always watch the process done the first time before I try it. Being an apprentice  you know  you do that. Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out  you know  this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife. And I'm like that's not rubber at all  you know. And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies  it was very    it was  it was impressive. In the space of about two seconds  Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail  right next to the butt of the lamb  and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding. A second later  with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger  he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp. And he pulled it toward him  like so  and he took the knife and he put it on the tip. Now you think you know what's coming  Michael    you don't  OK  He snips it  throws the tip over his shoulder  and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward  and then his head dips down  obscuring my view  but what I hear is a slurping sound  and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding. Can we roll the video  No I'm kidding    we don't    I thought it best to talk in pictures. So  I do something now I've never ever done on a  Dirty Jobs  shoot  ever. I say   Time out. Stop.  You guys know the show  we use take one  we don't do take two. There's no writing  there's no scripting  there's no nonsense. We don't fool around  we don't rehearse    we shoot what we get  I said   Stop. This is nuts.  I mean  you know.  This is crazy. We can't do this.  And Albert's like   What   And I'm like   I don't know what just happened  but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it.  And he said  Well  that's how we do it.  And I said   Why would you do it this way   And before I even let him explain  I said   I want to do it the right way  with the rubber bands.  And he says   Like the Humane Society   And I said   Yes  like the Humane Society. Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed    we're on in five continents  dude. We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel    we can't do this.  He says   OK.  He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands. Melanie picks up another lamb  puts it on the post  band goes on the tail  band goes on the scrotum. Lamb goes on the ground  lamb takes two steps  falls down  gets up  shakes a little  takes another couple steps  falls down. I'm like  this is not a good sign for this lamb  at all. Gets up  walks to the corner  it's quivering  and it lies down and it's in obvious distress. And I'm looking at the lamb and I say   Albert  how long  When does he get up   He's like   A day.  I said   A day  How long does it take them to fall off    A week.  Meanwhile  the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is  you know  he's just prancing around  bleeding stopped. He's  you know  nibbling on some grass  frolicking. And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was  in that second. And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am  so much of the time. And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done  and there are like     of these lambs in the pen  and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno  and I'm like ...  Laughter  Melanie picks up the lamb  puts it on the post  opens it up. Albert hands me the knife. I go in  tail comes off. I go in  I grab the scrotum  tip comes off. Albert instructs   Push it way up there.  I do.  Push it further.  I do. The testicles emerge    they look like thumbs  coming right at you    and he says   Bite 'em. Just bite 'em off.  And I heard him  I heard all the words. Like  how did    how did I get here  How did    you know    I mean    how did I get here  It's just    it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own  and suddenly  I'm standing there  in the Rockies  and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy. You know  Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity. And I'm like   What is this jacked up metaphor  I don't like what I'm thinking right now.  And I can't get this thought out of my head  and I can't get that vision out of my sight  so I did what I had to do. I went in and I took them. I took them like this  and I yanked my face back. And I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin. And now I can't get    I can't shake the metaphor. OK  I'm still in  Poetics   in Aristotle  and I'm thinking    out of nowhere  two terms come crashing into my head that I haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there. And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia. Anagnorisis and peripeteia. Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery. Literally  the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis. It's what our network does  it's what  Dirty Jobs  is. And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day. Great. The other word  peripeteia  that's the moment in the great tragedies  you know    Euripides and Sophocles    the moment where Oedipus has his moment  where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother. OK. That's peripety or peripeteia. And this metaphor in my head    I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin. I got to tell you  it's such a great device though. When you start to look for peripetia  you find it everywhere. I mean  Bruce Willis in  The Sixth Sense   right  Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people  and then  boom     Oh  I'm dead     peripetia. You know  It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way. Neo in  The Matrix   you know   Oh  I'm living in a computer program     that's weird. These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations  and I've been having them  over     dirty jobs  I have them all the time  but that one    that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for. And  as I stood there  looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled    but it looked OK. Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on  and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often  in a literal way  what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon  Because  look  I'm not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is. And I talk to him. And he says   Hey Mike. Look  I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not  but do you realize you've shot in every state  You've worked in mining  you've worked in fishing  you've worked in steel  you've worked in every major industry. You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years  right   I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye  dribbling down her chin  with the steel workers. I mean  these are the people that I work with every single day.  And if you have something to say about their thoughts  collectively  it might be time to think about it. Because  dude  you know  four years.  You know  that's in my head  testicles are on my chin  thoughts are bouncing around. And  after that shoot  Dirty Jobs really didn't change  in terms of what the show is  but it changed for me  personally. And now  when I talk about the show  I no longer just tell the story you heard and     like it. I do  but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong  some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct  and they're not. People with dirty jobs are happier than you think. As a group  they're the happiest people I know. And I don't want to start whistling  Look for the Union Label   and all that happy worker crap. I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work. Roadkill picker uppers whistle while they work. I swear to God    I did it with them. They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life. And I see it over and over and over again. So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows. Follow your passion    we've been talking about it here for the last    hours. Follow your passion    what could possibly be wrong with that  Probably the worst advice I ever got. You know  follow your dreams and go broke  right  I mean  that's all I heard growing up. I didn't know what to do with my life  but I was told if you follow your passion  it's going to work out. I can give you    examples  right now    Bob Combs  the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine. Why  Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed  and he is one rich pig farmer  and he is good for the environment  and he spends his days doing this incredible service  and he smells like hell  but God bless him. He's making a great living. You ask him   Did you follow your passion here   and he'd laugh at you. The guy's worth    he just got offered like    million dollars for his farm and turned it down  outside of Vegas. He didn't follow his passion. He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way. And I hear that story over and over. Matt Froind  a dairy farmer in New Canaan  Connecticut  who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk  if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots. Now  he's selling them to Walmart. Follow his passion  The guy's    come on. So I started to look at passion  I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness    as Tim talked about earlier  that's a huge distinction. I started to look at teamwork and determination  and basically all those platitudes they call  successories  that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now. That stuff    it's suddenly all been turned on its head. Safety    safety first  Going back to  you know  OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society  what if OSHA got it wrong  I mean    this is heresy  what I'm about to say    but what if it's really safety third  Right  No  I mean really. What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with  but the ones who really get it done  they're not out there talking about safety first. They know that other things come first    the business of doing the work comes first  the business of getting it done. And I'll never forget  up in the Bering Sea  I was on a crab boat with the  Deadliest Catch  guys    which I also work on    in the first season. We're about     miles off the coast of Russia     foot seas  big waves  green water coming over the wheelhouse  right  Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen  and I was back with a guy  lashing the pots down. So  I'm    feet off the deck  which is like looking down at the top of your shoe  you know  and it's doing this in the ocean. Unspeakably dangerous. I scamper down  I go into the wheelhouse and I say  with some level of incredulity   Captain  OSHA.  And he says   OSHA  Ocean.  And he points out there. But in that moment  what he said next can't be repeated in the lower   . It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site. But he looked at me  and he said   Son     he's my age  by the way  he calls me son  I love that    he says   Son  I'm a captain of a crab boat. My responsibility is not to get you home alive. My responsibility is to get you home rich.  You want to get home alive  that's on you. And for the rest of that day  safety first. I was like    So  the idea that we create this false    this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility as though it's our own  and vice versa. Anyhow  a whole lot of things. I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong. But  what it all comes down to is this. I formed a theory  and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and    seconds. It goes like this    we've declared war on work  as a society  all of us. It's a civil war. It's a cold war  really. We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way  but we've done it. And we've waged this war on at least four fronts  certainly in Hollywood. The way we portray working people on TV    it's laughable. If there's a plumber  he's     pounds and he's got a giant butt crack. Admit it. You see him all the time. That's what plumbers look like  right  We turn them into heroes  or we turn them into punch lines. That's what TV does. We try hard on  Dirty Jobs  not to do that  which is why I do the work and I don't cheat. But  we've waged this war on Madison Avenue. I mean  so many of the commercials that come out there    in the way of a message  what's really being said  Your life would be better if you could work a little less  if you didn't have to work so hard  if you could get home a little earlier  if you could retire a little faster  if you could punch out a little sooner    it's all in there  over and over  again and again. Washington  I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don't really know. I just know that that's a front in this war. And right here guys  Silicon Valley  I mean    how many people have an iPhone on them right now  How many people have their Blackberries  We're plugged in  we're connected. I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution. Good grief  not to this crowd. But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time. And nobody celebrates imitation the way  Dirty Jobs  guys know it has to be done. Your iPhone without those people making the same interface  the same circuitry  the same board  over and over  All of that  That's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it. So  we've got this new toolbox  you know. Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks. They look like the stuff we walk around with. And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs. And I realized  probably too late in this game    I hope not  because I don't know if I can do     more of these things    but we're going to do as many as we can. And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with  is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things  not just the testicles on my chin. I got a lot wrong. So  we're thinking    by we  I mean me    that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work  manual labor  skilled labor. Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits. I'm talking about grandfather stuff  the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of    you know  kind of lost a little. Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs. The infrastructure is a huge deal. This war on work  that I suppose exists  has casualties like any other war. The infrastructure's the first one  declining trade school enrollments are the second one. Every single year  fewer electricians  fewer carpenters  fewer plumbers  fewer welders  fewer pipefitters  fewer steamfitters. The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys    the ones that have been in decline  over and over. Meanwhile  we've got two trillion dollars    at a minimum  according to the American Society of Civil Engineers    that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure  which is currently rated at a D minus. So  if I were running for anything  and I'm not  I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want. And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us  but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites. They're two sides of the same coin  just like innovation and imitation  like risk and responsibility  like peripetia and anagnorisis  like that poor little lamb  who I hope isn't quivering anymore  and like my time that's gone. It's been great talking to you and get back to work  will you  The new me is beauty. Yeah  people used to say   Norman's OK  but if you followed what he said  everything would be usable but it would be ugly.  Well  I didn't have that in mind  so ... This is neat. Thank you for setting up my display. I mean  it's just wonderful. And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for  but I want it. And that's my new life. My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about  and  pretty   and  emotions.  The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun. And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer  produced by Alessi. It's just neat  it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house    but I have it in the entryway  I don't use it to make juice. In fact  I bought the gold plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says   Don't use this juicer to make juice.  The acid will ruin the gold plating. So actually  I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture. Beneath it is a wonderful knife. It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan. First of all  look at the shape    it's just wonderful to look at. Second of all  it's really beautifully balanced  it holds well  it feels well. And third of all  it's so sharp  it just cuts. It's a delight to use. And so it's got everything  right  It's beautiful and it's functional. And I can tell you stories about it  which makes it reflective  and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion. And those are the three components. Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping pong table and placed a projector above it  and on the ping pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it. And as you play ping pong  whenever the ball hits part of the table  the ripples spread out and the fish run away. But of course  then the ball hits the other side  the ripples hit the    poor fish  they can't find any peace and quiet. Is that a good way to play ping pong  No. But is it fun  Yeah  Yeah. Or look at Google. If you type in  oh say   emotion and design   you get    pages of results. So Google just took their logo and they spread it out. Instead of saying   You got        results. This is one through   . Next   they just give you as many o's as there are pages. It's really simple and subtle. I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it. That's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it    it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn't know why. And it's just clever. And of course  what's especially good is  if you type  design and emotion   the first response out of those    pages is my website. Now  the weird thing is Google lies  because if I type  design and emotion   it says   You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway.  So  OK. So I type  design emotion  and my website wasn't first again. It was third. Oh well  different story. There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile. It said   You know  this is a car that has lots of faults. Buy it anyway. It's so much fun to drive.  And if you look at the inside of the car    I mean  I loved it  I wanted to see it  I rented it  this is me taking a picture while my son is driving    and the inside of the car  the whole design is fun. It's round  it's neat. The controls work wonderfully. So that's my new life  it's all about fun. I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better  and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out    look ... I'm going to put a plank on the ground. So  imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and    feet long and I'm going to walk on it  and you see I can walk on it without looking  I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down. No problem. Now I'm going to put the plank     feet in the air    and I'm not going to go near it  thank you. Intense fear paralyzes you. It actually affects the way the brain works. So  Paul Saffo  before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk  and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus. That's what fear and anxiety does  it causes you to be    what's called depth first processing    to focus  not be distracted. And I couldn't force myself across that. Now some people can    circus workers  steel workers. But it really changes the way you think. And then  a psychologist  Alice Isen  did this wonderful experiment. She brought students in to solve problems. So  she'd bring people into the room  and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here. It was an empty room  except for a table with a bunch of crap on it    some papers and scissors and stuff. And she'd bring them in  and she'd say   This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life. Would you tie those two strings together   So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string. Still can't reach it. And  basically  none of them could solve it. You bring in a second group of people  and you say   Oh  before we start  I got this box of candy  and I don't eat candy. Would you like the box of candy   And turns out they liked it  and it made them happy    not very happy  but a little bit of happy. And guess what    they solved the problem. And it turns out that when you're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain  which focuses you makes you depth first. And when you're happy    what we call positive valence    you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes  which makes you a breadth first problem solver  you're more susceptible to interruption  you do out of the box thinking. That's what brainstorming is about  right  With brainstorming we make you happy  we play games  and we say   No criticism   and you get all these weird  neat ideas. But in fact  if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say   Oh  I got a new way of doing it.  So to get work done  you've got to set a deadline  right  You've got be anxious. The brain works differently if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative. You get a little problem  you say   Ah  I'll figure it out.  No big deal. There's something I call the visceral level of processing  and there will be visceral level design. Biology    we have co adapted through biology to like bright colors. That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants  because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed. There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain. We dislike bitter tastes  we dislike loud sounds  we dislike hot temperatures  cold temperatures. We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces  we like symmetrical faces  etc.  etc. So that's the visceral level. In design  you can express visceral in lots of ways  like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot  exciting. Or the      Jaguar  It's actually a crummy car  falls apart all the time  but the owners love it. And it's beautiful    it's in the Museum of Modern Art. A water bottle  You buy it because of the bottle  not because of the water. And when people are finished  they don't throw it away. They keep it for    you know  it's like the old wine bottles  you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again  which proves it's not the water. It's all about the visceral experience. The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done. Visceral is subconscious  you're unaware of it. Behavioral is subconscious  you're unaware of it. Almost everything we do is subconscious. I'm walking around the stage    I'm not attending to the control of my legs. I'm doing a lot  most of my talk is subconscious  it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot. Most of what we do is subconscious. Automatic behavior    skilled behavior    is subconscious  controlled by the behavioral side. And behavioral design is all about feeling in control  which includes usability  understanding    but also the feel and heft. That's why the Global knives are so neat. They're so nicely balanced  so sharp  that you really feel you're in control of the cutting. Or  just driving a high performance sports car over a demanding curb    again  feeling that you are in complete control of the environment. Or the sensual feeling. This is a Kohler shower  a waterfall shower  and actually  all those knobs beneath are also showerheads. It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours    and not waste water  by the way  because it recirculates the same dirty water. Or this    this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago. It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot. That's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back  and you put tea in  and then you fill it with water. The water then seeps over the tea. And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right    the tea is to the right of this line. There's a little ledge inside  so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that. And when the tea is ready  or almost ready  you tilt it. And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing. And when it's finished  you put it vertically  and now the tea is    you remember    above this line and the water only comes to here    and so it keeps the tea out. On top of that  it communicates  which is what emotion does. Emotion is all about acting  emotion is really about acting. It's being safe in the world. Cognition is about understanding the world  emotion is about interpreting it    saying good  bad  safe  dangerous  and getting us ready to act  which is why the muscles tense or relax. And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else    because their muscles are acting  subconsciously  except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion. Well  this has emotions if you like  because it signals the waiter that   Hey  I'm finished. See    upright.  And the waiter can come by and say   Would you like more water   It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design. And the third level is reflective  which is  if you like the superego  it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do  no control over the    doesn't see the senses  doesn't control the muscles. It looks over what's going on. It's that little voice in your head that's watching and saying   That's good. That's bad.  Or   Why are you doing that  I don't understand.  It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness. Here's a great reflective product. Owners of the Hummer have said   You know I've owned many cars in my life    all sorts of exotic cars  but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention.  It's about attention. It's about their image  not about the car. If you want a more positive model    this is the GM car. And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment. And you'll buy it to protect the environment  even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected. But that's reflective design as well. Or an expensive watch  so you can impress people     Oh gee  I didn't know you had that watch.  As opposed to this one  which is a pure behavioral watch  which probably keeps better time than the         watch I just showed you. But it's ugly. This is a clear Don Norman watch. And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other  the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying   It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe.  If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart  you'd never go on the ride. So  it's pitting one against the other. The other neat thing ... So Jake Cress is this furniture maker  and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture. And this is his chair with claw  and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices. And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story. And that's what's nice about emotion. So that's the new me. I'm only saying positive things from now on. I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense    a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across. And some of you may argue   Well  don't today's cell phones do that already   But I would say no. When you meet someone here at TED    and this is the top networking place  of course  of the year    you don't shake somebody's hand and then say   Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you   Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers  you don't take out your cell phone  and open a browser  and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make. So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way  without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior. And I'm here to unveil our latest effort  and most successful effort so far  which is still very much a work in process. I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf    and that  by the way  only cost     dollars at this point in time. I'm wearing a camera  just a simple web cam  a portable  battery powered projection system with a little mirror. These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device. And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry  who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system. And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him. The system tracks the four significant fingers. In this case  he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize. But if you want a more stylish version  you could also paint your nails in different colors. And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to  for example  a map of Long Beach  zoom in and out  etc. The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the  take a picture  gesture  and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you. And when he then walks back to the Media Lab  he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken  sort through them and organize them  and re size them  etc.  again using all natural gestures. So  some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han  or some of you may think   Well  doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table   And yes  you also interact using natural gestures  both hands  etc. But the difference here is that you can use any surface  you can walk up to any surface  including your hand  if nothing else is available  and interact with this projected data. The device is completely portable  and can be    So  one important difference is that it's totally mobile. Another even more important difference is that in mass production  this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging    could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck. But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in  Minority Report   the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you. So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels. And  as he picks up a product  the system can recognize the product that he's picking up  using either image recognition or marker technology  and give him the green light or an orange light. He can ask for additional information. So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice  given his personal criteria. Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice. If he picks up a book in the bookstore  he can get an Amazon rating    it gets projected right on the cover of the book. This is Juan's book  our previous speaker  which gets a great rating  by the way  at Amazon. And so  Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book    reader comments  maybe sort of information by his favorite critic  etc. If he turns to a particular page  he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page. Reading the newspaper    it never has to be outdated. You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about. You can get the latest sports scores  etc. This is a more controversial one. As you interact with someone at TED  maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags  the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages. In this case  the student is interested in cameras  etc. On your way to the airport  if you pick up your boarding pass  it can tell you that your flight is delayed  that the gate has changed  etc. And  if you need to know what the current time is  it's as simple as drawing a watch    on your arm. So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across. My student Pranav  who's really  like I said  the genius behind this. He does deserve a lot of applause  because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months  actually. And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either. But it's not perfect yet  it's very much a work in progress. And who knows  maybe in another    years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant. Thank you. I was speaking to a group of about     kids  ages six to eight  at a children's museum  and I brought with me a bag full of legs  similar to the kinds of things you see up here  and had them laid out on a table for the kids. And  from my experience  you know  kids are naturally curious about what they don't know  or don't understand  or is foreign to them. They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way  and maybe censors that natural curiosity  or you know  reins in the question asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids. So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids  saying   Now  whatever you do  don't stare at her legs.  But  of course  that's the point. That's why I was there  I wanted to invite them to look and explore. So I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own. The doors open  the kids descend on this table of legs  and they are poking and prodding  and they're wiggling toes  and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that. And I said   Kids  really quickly    I woke up this morning  I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house    nothing too big  two or three stories    but  if you could think of any animal  any superhero  any cartoon character  anything you can dream up right now  what kind of legs would you build me   And immediately a voice shouted   Kangaroo    No  no  no  Should be a frog    No. It should be Go Go Gadget    No  no  no  It should be the Incredibles.  And other things that I don't    aren't familiar with. And then  one eight year old said   Hey  why wouldn't you want to fly too   And the whole room  including me  was like   Yeah.  And just like that  I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as  disabled  to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet. Somebody that might even be super abled. Interesting. So some of you actually saw me at TED     years ago. And there's been a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees  and I am no exception. TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration. At the time  the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics. I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah  which you may have seen on stage yesterday. And also these very life like  intrinsically painted silicone legs. So at the time  it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs. So that we can stop compartmentalizing form  function and aesthetic  and assigning them different values. Well  lucky for me  a lot of people answered that call. And the journey started  funny enough  with a TED conference attendee    Chee Pearlman  who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today. She was the editor then of a magazine called ID  and she gave me a cover story. This started an incredible journey. Curious encounters were happening to me at the time  I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world. And people would come up to me after the conference  after my talk  men and women. And the conversation would go something like this   You know Aimee  you're very attractive. You don't look disabled.  I thought   Well  that's amazing  because I don't feel disabled.  And it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored  about beauty. What does a beautiful woman have to look like  What is a sexy body  And interestingly  from an identity standpoint  what does it mean to have a disability  I mean  people    Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do. Nobody calls her disabled. So this magazine  through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville  went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen  and photographer Nick Knight  who were also interested in exploring that conversation. So  three months after TED I found myself on a plane to London  doing my first fashion shoot  which resulted in this cover     Fashion able   Three months after that  I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash. Nobody knew    everyone thought they were wooden boots. Actually  I have them on stage with me  grapevines  magnolias    truly stunning. Poetry matters. Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art. It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look  and look a little longer  and maybe even understand. I learned this firsthand with my next adventure. The artist Matthew Barney  in his film opus called the  The Cremaster Cycle.  This is where it really hit home for me    that my legs could be wearable sculpture. And even at this point  I started to move away from the need to replicate human ness as the only aesthetic ideal. So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane  a.k.a. bowling ball material. Heavy  Then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them  and beetroots out the top  and a very lovely brass toe. That's a good close up of that one. Then another character was a half woman  half cheetah    a little homage to my life as an athlete.    hours of prosthetic make up to get into a creature that had articulated paws  claws and a tail that whipped around  like a gecko. And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these    look like jellyfish legs  also polyurethane. And the only purpose that these legs can serve  outside the context of the film  is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination. So whimsy matters. Today  I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me  and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet  and I can change my height    I have a variable of five different heights. Today  I'm  '  . And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan  my first night out on the town  I went to a very fancy party. And a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal  '  . Her mouth dropped open when she saw me  and she went   But you're so tall   And I said   I know. Isn't it fun   I mean  it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts  but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams that I never expected I would ever have. And I was having fun with it. And she looked at me  and she said   But  Aimee  that's not fair.  And the incredible thing was she really meant it. It's not fair that you can change your height  as you want it. And that's when I knew    that's when I knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade. It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency. It's a conversation about augmentation. It's a conversation about potential. A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore. It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space. So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment. And what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting edge technology    robotics  bionics    with the age old poetry  we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity. I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity  we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have. I think of Shakespeare's Shylock   If you prick us  do we not bleed  and if you tickle us  do we not laugh   It is our humanity  and all the potential within it  that makes us beautiful. Thank you. So  here we go  a flyby of play. It's got to be serious if the New York Times puts a cover story of their February   th Sunday magazine about play. At the bottom of this  it says   It's deeper than gender. Seriously  but dangerously fun. And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution.  Not bad  except if you look at that cover  what's missing  You see any adults  Well  lets go back to the   th century. This is a courtyard in Europe  and a mixture of     different kinds of play. All ages  solo play  body play  games  taunting. And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then. I think we may have lost something in our culture. So I'm gonna take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence. North of Churchill  Manitoba  in October and November  there's no ice on Hudson Bay. And this polar bear that you see  this      pound male  he's wild and fairly hungry. And Norbert Rosing  a German photographer  is there on scene  making a series of photos of these huskies  who are tethered. And from out of stage left comes this wild  male polar bear  with a predatory gaze. Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you  there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble. But on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow  wagging her tail. And something very unusual happens. That fixed behavior    which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal    changes. And this polar bear stands over the husky  no claws extended  no fangs taking a look. And they begin an incredible ballet. A play ballet. This is in nature  it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death. And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear  and look a little more closely  they're in an altered state. They're in a state of play. And it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible. They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals. And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us. Now how did I get involved in this  John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers  and I have. The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes  in retrospect  when we studied his tragic mass murder  to the importance of play  in that that individual  by deep study  was found to have severe play deprivation. Charles Whitman was his name. And our committee  which consisted of a lot of hard scientists  did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated. And that finding has stood the test of time    unfortunately even into more recent times  at Virginia Tech. And other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play  but I didn't really understand what it was. And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it. And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it  by any means. But there are ways of looking at it that I think can give you    give us all a taxonomy  a way of thinking about it. And this image is  for humans  the beginning point of play. When that mother and infant lock eyes  and the infant's old enough to have a social smile  what happens    spontaneously    is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother. And she begins to babble and coo and smile  and so does the baby. If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram  the right brain of each of them becomes attuned  so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on. And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans. And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play  but it's never just singularly one thing. We're going to look at body play  which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity. This is a mountain goat. If you're having a bad day  try this  jump up and down  wiggle around    you're going to feel better. And you may feel like this character  who is also just doing it for its own sake. It doesn't have a particular purpose  and that's what's great about play. If its purpose is more important than the act of doing it  it's probably not play. And there's a whole other type of play  which is object play. And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball  and he or she's going to roll down a hill. And    they don't throw it at each other  but this is a fundamental part of being playful. The human hand  in manipulation of objects  is the hand in search of a brain  the brain is in search of a hand  and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way. JPL we heard this morning    JPL is an incredible place. They have located two consultants  Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson  who are    Frank Wilson is a neurologist  Nate Johnson is a mechanic. He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach  and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems. And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion  quite on his own  that the students who could no longer solve problems  such as fixing cars  hadn't worked with their hands. Frank Wilson had written a book called  The Hand.  They got together    JPL hired them. Now JPL  NASA and Boeing  before they will hire a research and development problem solver    even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech    if they haven't fixed cars  haven't done stuff with their hands early in life  played with their hands  they can't problem solve as well. So play is practical  and it's very important. Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration.  Laughter  But it has to be safe exploration. This happens to be OK    he's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good. But curiosity  exploration  are part of the play scene. If you want to belong  you need social play. And social play is part of what we're about here today  and is a byproduct of the play scene. Rough and tumble play. These lionesses  seen from a distance  looked like they were fighting. But if you look closely  they're kind of like the polar bear and husky  no claws  flat fur  soft eyes  open mouth with no fangs  balletic movements  curvilinear movements    all specific to play. And rough and tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us. Preschool kids  for example  should be allowed to dive  hit  whistle  scream  be chaotic  and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts    cognitive  emotional and physical    that come as a part of rough and tumble play. Spectator play  ritual play    we're involved in some of that. Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment    rare    where the Red Sox won the World Series. But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture  and you can get a sense that they're all at play. Imaginative play. I love this picture because my daughter  who's now almost     is in this picture  but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination  her ability to spin yarns at this age    preschool. A really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play. And I love this one  because it's also what we're about. We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story. The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story. I'm telling you a story today about play. Well  this bushman  I think  is talking about the fish that got away that was that long  but it's a fundamental part of the play scene. So what does play do for the brain  Well  a lot. We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain  because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play. I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant. They'd given me a large grant when I was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers  and I thought I had a pretty good track record  and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play  it was obvious that they were not    did not feel that play was serious. I think that    that's a few years back    I think that wave is past  and the play wave is cresting  because there is some good science. Nothing lights up the brain like play. Three dimensional play fires up the cerebellum  puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe    the executive portion    helps contextual memory be developed  and    and  and  and. So it's    for me  its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play  and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way. And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about. And this is one of the ways you can study play    is to get a     lead electroencephalogram. I'm sorry I don't have a playful looking subject  but it allows mobility  which has limited the actual study of play. And we've got a mother infant play scenario that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment. The reason I put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does. The animal world has objectified it. In the animal world  if you take rats  who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play    they squeak  they wrestle  they pin each other  that's part of their play. If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with  and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with  and then you present those rats with a cat odor saturated collar  they're hardwired to flee and hide. Pretty smart    they don't want to get killed by a cat. So what happens  They both hide out. The non players never come out    they die. The players slowly explore the environment  and begin again to test things out. That says to me  at least in rats    and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture    that play may be pretty important for our survival. And  and  and    there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about. Now  this is a consequence of play deprivation.  Laughter  This took a long time    I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT and multiple EEGs  but as a couch potato  his brain has shrunk. And we do know that in domestic animals and others  when they're play deprived  they don't    and rats also    they don't develop a brain that is normal. Now  the program says that the opposite of play is not work  it's depression. And I think if you think about life without play    no humor  no flirtation  no movies  no games  no fantasy and  and  and. Try and imagine a culture or a life  adult or otherwise without play. And the thing that's so unique about our species is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime. And we all have capacity to play signal. Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago. What's going to follow from that behavior is play. And you can trust it. The basis of human trust is established through play signals. And we begin to lose those signals  culturally and otherwise  as adults. That's a shame. I think we've got a lot of learning to do. Now  Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps. So part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal  facial  body  gestural. You know  you can tell    and I think when we're getting into collective play  its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals. You may not know this word  but it should be your biological first name and last name. Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood. And we are  by physical anthropologists  by many  many studies  the most neotenous  the most youthful  the most flexible  the most plastic of all creatures. And therefore  the most playful. And this gives us a leg up on adaptability. Now  there is a way of looking at play that I also want to emphasize here  which is the play history. Your own personal play history is unique  and often is not something we think about particularly. This is a book written by a consummate player by the name of Kevin Carroll. Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances  alcoholic mother  absent father  inner city Philadelphia  black  had to take care of a younger brother. Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined  he felt something different. And so he followed up on it. And his life    the transformation of his life from deprivation and what one would expect    potentially prison or death    he become a linguist  a trainer for the   ers and now is a motivational speaker. And he gives play as a transformative force over his entire life. Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress. Those of you who remember Al Gore  during the first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency  may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person  at least in public. And looking at his history  which is common in the press  it seems to me  at least    looking at it from a shrink's point of view    that a lot of his life was programmed. Summers were hard  hard work  in the heat of Tennessee summers. He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington  D.C. And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play    because I do know something about that    he wasn't as empowered  I think  as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive  which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history. So what I would encourage on an individual level to do  is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear  joyful  playful image that you have  whether it's with a toy  on a birthday or on a vacation. And begin to build to build from the emotion of that into how that connects with your life now. And you'll find  you may change jobs    which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this    in order to be more empowered through their play. Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it. Most of us work with groups  and I put this up because the d.school  the design school at Stanford  thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment  has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called  From Play to Innovation.  And you'll see this course is to investigate the human state of play  which is kind of like the polar bear husky state and its importance to creative thinking   to explore play behavior  its development and its biological basis  to apply those principles  through design thinking  to promote innovation in the corporate world  and the students will work with real world partners on design projects with widespread application.  This is our maiden voyage in this. We're about two and a half  three months into it  and it's really been fun. There is our star pupil  this labrador  who taught a lot of us what a state of play is  and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there. And Brendan Boyle  Rich Crandall    and on the far right is  I think  a person who will be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize    Stuart Thompson  in neuroscience. So we've had Brendan  who's from IDEO  and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom. And one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring  and to try and do something about it. So what will follow is a student made film about just that. Narrator  Flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing. Characterized by a feeling of energized focus  full involvement and success in the process of the activity. An important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another  disruptive to the day. Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task that they left at their desk. But it doesn't have to be that way. Some sage and repeatedly furry monks at this place called the d.school designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over. Take the meeting off  and have peace of mind that you can come back to me. Because when you need it again  the meeting is literally hanging in your closet. The Wearable Meeting. Because when you put it on  you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting. But when you take it off    that's when the real action happens. Stuart Brown  So I would encourage you all to engage not in the work play differential    where you set aside time to play    but where your life becomes infused minute by minute  hour by hour  with body  object  social  fantasy  transformational kinds of play. And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life. Thank You. John Hockenberry  So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go    I think I've heard this  in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play  that somehow  the way animals and humans deal with play  is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity. Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong. SB  Yeah  I don't think that's accurate  and I think probably because animals have taught us that. If you stop a cat from playing    which you can do  and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff    they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played. And if you imagine a kid pretending to be King Kong  or a race car driver  or a fireman  they don't all become race car drivers or firemen  you know. So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future    which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as    and thinking of it as a separate biological entity. And this is where my chasing animals for four  five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now  which is that play has a biological place  just like sleep and dreams do. And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically  animals sleep and dream  and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams. The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play. And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate. And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain. So it's not just something you do in your spare time. JH  How do you keep    and I know you're part of the scientific research community  and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else    how do you prevent    and some of the data that you've produced  the good science that you're talking about you've produced  is hot to handle. How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work  kind of like the Mozart metaphor  where   Oh  MRIs show that play enhances your intelligence. Well  let's round these kids up  put them in pens and make them play for months at a time  they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard.  How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you're developing  SB  Well  I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners    who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever    a state of play. So people know that it's there. And then you get an fMRI specialist  and you get Frank Wilson  and you get other kinds of hard scientists  including neuroendocrinologists. And you get them into a group together focused on play  and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously. Unfortunately  that hasn't been done sufficiently for the National Science Foundation  National Institute of Mental Health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously. I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease associated with play. And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival    long term    as learning some of the basic things about public health. JH  Stuart Brown  thank you very much. Time flies. It's actually almost    years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information  the way we work together  I invented the World Wide Web. Now     years on  at TED  I want to ask your help in a new reframing. So going back to       I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system. Nobody really did anything with it  pretty much. But    months later    this is how innovation happens       months later  my boss said I could do it on the side  as a sort of a play project  kick the tires of a new computer we'd got. And so he gave me the time to code it up. So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like  hypertext protocol  HTTP  the idea of URLs  these names for things which started with HTTP. I wrote the code and put it out there. Why did I do it  Well  it was basically frustration. I was frustrated    I was working as a software engineer in this huge  very exciting lab  lots of people coming from all over the world. They brought all sorts of different computers with them. They had all sorts of different data formats  all sorts  all kinds of documentation systems. So that  in all that diversity  if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this  everything I looked into  I had to connect to some new machine  I had to learn to run some new program  I would find the information I wanted in some new data format. And these were all incompatible. It was just very frustrating. The frustration was all this unlocked potential. In fact  on all these discs there were documents. So if you just imagined them all being part of some big  virtual documentation system in the sky  say on the Internet  then life would be so much easier. Well  once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo    actually he did  it was found after he died  his copy. He had written   Vague  but exciting   in pencil  in the corner. But in general it was difficult    it was really difficult to explain what the web was like. It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then. But then    OK  when TED started  there was no web so things like  click  didn't have the same meaning. I can show somebody a piece of hypertext  a page which has got links  and we click on the link and bing    there'll be another hypertext page. Not impressive. You know  we've seen that    we've got things on hypertext on CD ROMs. What was difficult was to get them to imagine  so  imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine. Alright  that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make. Well  some people did. So yeah  it was difficult to explain  but there was a grassroots movement. And that is what has made it most fun. That has been the most exciting thing  not the technology  not the things people have done with it  but actually the community  the spirit of all these people getting together  sending the emails. That's what it was like then. Do you know what  It's funny  but right now it's kind of like that again. I asked everybody  more or less  to put their documents    I said   Could you put your documents on this web thing   And you did. Thanks. It's been a blast  hasn't it  I mean  it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away. They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little  initial website that we started off with. Now  I want you to put your data on the web. Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential. There is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data. What do you mean   data   What's the difference    documents  data  Well  documents you read  OK  More or less  you read them  you can follow links from them  and that's it. Data    you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer. Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk  One of the great    yes a lot of people have seen it    one of the great TED Talks. Hans put up this presentation in which he showed  for various different countries  in various different colors    he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality  and he shot this thing animated through time. So  he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world. He put up a slide a little bit like this. It had underground all the data OK  data is brown and boxy and boring  and that's how we think of it  isn't it  Because data you can't naturally use by itself But in fact  data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it. In this case  Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things. He had put it together  combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software  which I think his son developed  originally  and produces this wonderful presentation. And Hans made a point of saying   Look  it's really important to have a lot of data.  And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying  very forcibly   It's really important to have a lot of data.  So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected  or six like he did  but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data. The technology is linked data  and it's extremely simple. If you want to put something on the web there are three rules  first thing is that those HTTP names    those things that start with  http      we're using them not just for documents now  we're using them for things that the documents are about. We're using them for people  we're using them for places  we're using them for your products  we're using them for events. All kinds of conceptual things  they have names now that start with HTTP. Second rule  if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web  I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing  about that event. Who's at the event  Whatever it is about that person  where they were born  things like that. So the second rule is I get important information back. Third rule is that when I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born  it's got relationships. Data is relationships. Interestingly  data is relationships. This person was born in Berlin  Berlin is in Germany. And when it has relationships  whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts HTTP. So  I can go ahead and look that thing up. So I look up a person    I can look up then the city where they were born  then I can look up the region it's in  and the town it's in  and the population of it  and so on. So I can browse this stuff. So that's it  really. That is linked data. I wrote an article entitled  Linked Data  a couple of years ago and soon after that  things started to happen. The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had  and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting. It's not just a whole lot of other plants. It's not just a root supplying a plant  but for each of those plants  whatever it is    a presentation  an analysis  somebody's looking for patterns in the data    they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together  and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together  the more powerful it is. So  linked data. The meme went out there. And  pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up  he noticed that Wikipedia    you know Wikipedia  the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it. Well  in those documents  there are little squares  little boxes. And in most information boxes  there's data. So he wrote a program to take the data  extract it from Wikipedia  and put it into a blob of linked data on the web  which he called dbpedia. Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up Berlin  you'll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about Berlin  and they're linked together. So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin  you'll end up pulling up these other things as well. And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow. This is just the grassroots stuff again  OK  Let's think about data for a bit. Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms. Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there. So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data. We could talk about government data  enterprise data is really important  there's scientific data  there's personal data  there's weather data  there's data about events  there's data about talks  and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff. I'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it  so that you also see how much unlocked potential. Let's start with government data. Barack Obama said in a speech  that he    American government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats. And I hope that they will put it up as linked data. That's important. Why is it important  Not just for transparency  yeah transparency in government is important  but that data    this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America. It's actual useful. It's got value. I can use it in my company. I could use it as a kid to do my homework. So we're talking about making the place  making the world run better by making this data available. In fact if you're responsible    if you know about some data in a government department  often you find that these people  they're very tempted to keep it    Hans calls it database hugging. You hug your database  you don't want to let it go until you've made a beautiful website for it. Well  I'd like to suggest that rather    yes  make a beautiful website  who am I to say don't make a beautiful website  Make a beautiful website  but first give us the unadulterated data  we want the data. We want unadulterated data. OK  we have to ask for raw data now. And I'm going to ask you to practice that  OK  Can you say  raw   Audience  Raw. Tim Berners Lee  Can you say  data   Audience  Data. TBL  Can you say  now   Audience  Now  TBL  Alright   raw data now   Audience  Raw data now  Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you  even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer. And it's not just America. It's all over the world. And it's not just governments  of course    it's enterprises as well. So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data. Here we are at TED  and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now    curing cancer  understanding the brain for Alzheimer's  understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable  understanding how the world works. The people who are going to solve those    the scientists    they have half formed ideas in their head  they try to communicate those over the web. But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases  often sitting in their computers  and actually  currently not shared. In fact  I'll just go into one area    if you're looking at Alzheimer's  for example  drug discovery    there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos  because they had their genomics data in one database in one building  and they had their protein data in another. Now  they are sticking it onto    linked data    and now they can ask the sort of question  that you probably wouldn't ask  I wouldn't ask    they would. What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons  Well  you take that mouthful and you put it into Google. Of course  there's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before. You get         hits    no results you can use. You ask the linked data    which they've now put together       hits  each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at. The power of being able to ask those questions  as a scientist    questions which actually bridge across different disciplines    is really a complete sea change. It's very very important. Scientists are totally stymied at the moment    the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems. Now if I go on like this  you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you. But  that's not true. In fact  data is about our lives. You just    you log on to your social networking site  your favorite one  you say   This is my friend.  Bing  Relationship. Data. You say   This photograph  it's about    it depicts this person.   Bing  That's data. Data  data  data. Every time you do things on the social networking site  the social networking site is taking data and using it    re purposing it    and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site. But  when you go to another linked data site    and let's say this is one about travel  and you say   I want to send this photo to all the people in that group   you can't get over the walls. The Economist wrote an article about it  and lots of people have blogged about it    tremendous frustration. The way to break down the silos is to get inter operability between social networking sites. We need to do that with linked data. One last type of data I'll talk about  maybe it's the most exciting. Before I came down here  I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap's a map  but it's also a Wiki. Zoom in and that square thing is a theater    which we're in right now    The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it. So I could go into edit mode  I could select the theater  I could add down at the bottom the name  and I could save it back. And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org  and you find this place  you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name. I did that. Me  I did that to the map. I just did that  I put that up on there. Hey  you know what  If I    that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs. And that is what linked data is all about. It's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit  and it all connecting. That's how linked data works. You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs. You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it. And we've practiced that. So  linked data    it's huge. I've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives  every aspect of work and pleasure  and it's not just about the number of places where data comes  it's about connecting it together. And when you connect data together  you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web  with documents. You get this really huge power out of it. So  we're at the stage now where we have to do this    the people who think it's a great idea. And all the people    and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because    even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it    they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them. OK  so it's called linked data. I want you to make it. I want you to demand it. And I think it's an idea worth spreading. Thanks. I m going around the world giving talks about Darwin  and usually what I m talking about is Darwin s strange inversion of reasoning. Now that title  that phrase  comes from a critic  an early critic  and this is a passage that I just love  and would like to read for you.  In the theory with which we have to deal  Absolute Ignorance is the artificer  so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system  that  in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine  it is not requisite to know how to make it. This proposition will be found on careful examination to express  in condensed form  the essential purport of the Theory  and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin s meaning  who  by a strange inversion of reasoning  seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill.  Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion. A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it   Test Two  Do you know of any building that didn t have a builder  Yes No. Do you know of any painting that didn t have a painter  Yes No. Do you know of any car that didn t have a maker  Yes No. If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above  give details.  A ha  I mean  it really is a strange inversion of reasoning. You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer. But Darwin shows that it s just false. Today  though  I m going to talk about Darwin s other strange inversion  which is equally puzzling at first  but in some ways just as important. It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet. Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy. We adore babies because they re so cute. And  of course  we are amused by jokes because they are funny. This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why. Let s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector  because sugar is high energy  and it s just been wired up to the preferer  to put it very crudely  and that s why we like sugar. Honey is sweet because we like it  not  we like it because honey is sweet.  There s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey. If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind  you wouldn t see why they tasted sweet. You have to look in our brains to understand why they re sweet. So if you think first there was sweetness  and then we evolved to like sweetness  you ve got it backwards  that s just wrong. It s the other way round. Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved. And there s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies. And it s a good thing that there isn t  because if there were  then Mother Nature would have a problem  How on earth do you get chimps to mate  Now you might think  ah  there s a solution  hallucinations. That would be one way of doing it  but there s a quicker way. Just wire the chimps up to love that look  and apparently they do. That s all there is to it. Over six million years  we and the chimps evolved our different ways. We became bald bodied  oddly enough  for one reason or another  they didn t. If we hadn t  then probably this would be the height of sexiness. Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high energy food. It wasn t designed for chocolate cake. Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus. The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen  who did his famous experiments with gulls  where he found that that orange spot on the gull s beak    if he made a bigger  oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder. It was a hyperstimulus for them  and they loved it. What we see with  say  chocolate cake is it s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring. And there are lots of supernormal stimuli  chocolate cake is one. There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness. And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here s a pretty good example. It s important that we love babies  and that we not be put off by  say  messy diapers. So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing  and they do. And  by the way  a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby. So nature works on many levels here. But now  if babies didn t look the way they do    if babies looked like this  that s what we would find adorable  that s what we would find    we would think  oh my goodness  do I ever want to hug that. This is the strange inversion. Well now  finally what about funny. My answer is  it s the same story  the same story. This is the hard one  the one that isn t obvious. That s why I leave it to the end. And I won t be able to say too much about it. But you have to think evolutionarily  you have to think  what hard job that has to be done    it s dirty work  somebody s got to do it    is so important to give us such a powerful  inbuilt reward for it when we succeed. Now  I think we've found the answer    I and a few of my colleagues. It s a neural system that s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job. Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging. Now I m not going to have time to spell it all out  but I ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward. And what we re doing is we re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switching humor on and off  by turning the knob on a joke    now it s not funny ... oh  now it s funnier ... now we ll turn a little bit more ... now it s not funny    in this way  we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain  the functional architecture of the brain. Matthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model. He s a computer scientist  Reginald Adams a psychologist  and there I am  and we re putting this together into a book. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality. And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital. I was burned very badly. And if you spend a lot of time in hospital  you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities. And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me. Now  you must have all taken a Band Aid off at some point  and you must have wondered what's the right approach. Do you rip it off quickly    short duration but high intensity    or do you take your Band Aid off slowly    you take a long time  but each second is not as painful    which one of those is the right approach  The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one  so they would grab hold and they would rip  and they would grab hold and they would rip. And because I had    percent of my body burned  it would take about an hour. And as you can imagine  I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity. And I would try to reason with them and say   Why don't we try something else  Why don't we take it a little longer    maybe two hours instead of an hour    and have less of this intensity   And the nurses told me two things. They told me that they had the right model of the patient    that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain    and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ... This is not just in Hebrew  by the way. It's in every language I've had experience with so far. And  you know  there's not much    there wasn't much I could do  and they kept on doing what they were doing. And about three years later  when I left the hospital  I started studying at the university. And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way  and you can try to examine this question  maybe learn something about the world. So that's what I did. I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients. So originally I didn't have much money  so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice. And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it  and I would crunch it a little bit. And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods  and pain that went up and pain that went down  and with breaks and without breaks    all kinds of versions of pain. And when I finished hurting people a little bit  I would ask them  so  how painful was this  Or  how painful was this  Or  if you had to choose between the last two  which one would you choose  I kept on doing this for a while. And then  like all good academic projects  I got more funding. I moved to sounds  electrical shocks    I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain. But at the end of this process  what I learned was that the nurses were wrong. Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience  and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time. It turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity  I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower. It turns out it would have been better to start with my face  which was much more painful  and move toward my legs  giving me a trend of improvement over time    that would have been also less painful. And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain. All of these would have been great things to do  and my nurses had no idea. And from that point on I started thinking  are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision  or is it a more general case  And it turns out it's a more general case    there's a lot of mistakes we do. And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities  and I want to talk to you about cheating. And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting  but also it tells us something  I think  about the stock market situation we're in. So  my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene  exploded all of a sudden  and I started thinking about what is happening here. Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things  or are we talking a more endemic situation  that many people are actually capable of behaving this way  So  like we usually do  I decided to do a simple experiment. And here's how it went. If you were in the experiment  I would pass you a sheet of paper with    simple math problems that everybody could solve  but I wouldn't give you enough time. When the five minutes were over  I would say   Pass me the sheets of paper  and I'll pay you a dollar per question.  People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task    on average people would solve four problems. Other people I would tempt to cheat. I would pass their sheet of paper. When the five minutes were over  I would say   Please shred the piece of paper. Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack  and tell me how many questions you got correctly.  People now solved seven questions on average. Now  it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples    a few people cheated a lot. Instead  what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit. Now  in economic theory  cheating is a very simple cost benefit analysis. You say  what's the probability of being caught  How much do I stand to gain from cheating  And how much punishment would I get if I get caught  And you weigh these options out    you do the simple cost benefit analysis  and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not. So  we try to test this. For some people  we varied how much money they could get away with    how much money they could steal. We paid them    cents per correct question     cents  a dollar  five dollars     dollars per correct question. You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases  people would cheat more  but in fact it wasn't the case. We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit. What about the probability of being caught  Some people shredded half the sheet of paper  so there was some evidence left. Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper. Some people shredded everything  went out of the room  and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over     dollars. You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down  people would cheat more  but again  this was not the case. Again  a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit  and they were insensitive to these economic incentives. So we said   If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations  to these forces  what could be going on   And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces. At one hand  we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves  so we don't want to cheat. On the other hand  we can cheat a little bit  and still feel good about ourselves. So  maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over  but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree  as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves. We call this like a personal fudge factor. Now  how would you test a personal fudge factor  Initially we said  what can we do to shrink the fudge factor  So  we got people to the lab  and we said   We have two tasks for you today.  First  we asked half the people to recall either    books they read in high school  or to recall The Ten Commandments  and then we tempted them with cheating. Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments    and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments    but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments  given the opportunity to cheat  did not cheat at all. It wasn't that the more religious people    the people who remembered more of the Commandments    cheated less  and the less religious people    the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments    cheated more. The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments  they stopped cheating. In fact  even when we gave self declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat  they don't cheat at all. Now  Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system  so we said   Why don't we get people to sign the honor code   So  we got people to sign   I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code.  Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever. And this is particularly interesting  because MIT doesn't have an honor code. So  all this was about decreasing the fudge factor. What about increasing the fudge factor  The first experiment    I walked around MIT and I distributed six packs of Cokes in the refrigerators    these were common refrigerators for the undergrads. And I came back to measure what we technically call the half lifetime of Coke    how long does it last in the refrigerators  As you can expect it doesn't last very long  people take it. In contrast  I took a plate with six one dollar bills  and I left those plates in the same refrigerators. No bill ever disappeared. Now  this is not a good social science experiment  so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before. A third of the people we passed the sheet  they gave it back to us. A third of the people we passed it to  they shredded it  they came to us and said   Mr. Experimenter  I solved X problems. Give me X dollars.  A third of the people  when they finished shredding the piece of paper  they came to us and said   Mr Experimenter  I solved X problems. Give me X tokens.  We did not pay them with dollars  we paid them with something else. And then they took the something else  they walked    feet to the side  and exchanged it for dollars. Think about the following intuition. How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home  compared to how bad would you feel about taking    cents from a petty cash box  These things feel very differently. Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference  Our subjects doubled their cheating. I'll tell you what I think about this and the stock market in a minute. But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet  because in Enron  there's also a social element. People see each other behaving. In fact  every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating. What does this cause us  So  we did another experiment. We got a big group of students to be in the experiment  and we prepaid them. So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment  and we told them that at the end  we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK  The same thing happens. When we give people the opportunity to cheat  they cheat. They cheat just by a little bit  all the same. But in this experiment we also hired an acting student. This acting student stood up after    seconds  and said   I solved everything. What do I do now   And the experimenter said   If you've finished everything  go home. That's it. The task is finished.  So  now we had a student    an acting student    that was a part of the group. Nobody knew it was an actor. And they clearly cheated in a very  very serious way. What would happen to the other people in the group  Will they cheat more  or will they cheat less  Here is what happens. It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing. Here is the thing. We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh. And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities  Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh. All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students. When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student    he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student    but he was a part of their group  cheating went up. But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt  cheating went down. Now  this is important  because remember  when the moment the student stood up  it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating  because the experimenter said   You've finished everything. Go home   and they went with the money. So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again. It was about the norms for cheating. If somebody from our in group cheats and we see them cheating  we feel it's more appropriate  as a group  to behave this way. But if it's somebody from another group  these terrible people    I mean  not terrible in this    but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with  from another university  another group  all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up    a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment    and people cheat even less. So  what have we learned from this about cheating  We've learned that a lot of people can cheat. They cheat just by a little bit. When we remind people about their morality  they cheat less. When we get bigger distance from cheating  from the object of money  for example  people cheat more. And when we see cheating around us  particularly if it's a part of our in group  cheating goes up. Now  if we think about this in terms of the stock market  think about what happens. What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way  Would they not be able to see it this way  Of course they would. What happens when you do other things  like you remove things from money  You call them stock  or stock options  derivatives  mortgage backed securities. Could it be that with those more distant things  it's not a token for one second  it's something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time    could it be that people will cheat even more  And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them  I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market. More generally  I want to tell you something about behavioral economics. We have many intuitions in our life  and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong. The question is  are we going to test those intuitions  We can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life  in our business life  and most particularly when it goes to policy  when we think about things like No Child Left Behind  when you create new stock markets  when you create other policies    taxation  health care and so on. And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them. So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages. And I learned two interesting things. One was that my favorite nurse  Ettie  told me that I did not take her pain into consideration. She said   Of course  you know  it was very painful for you. But think about me as a nurse  taking  removing the bandages of somebody I liked  and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time. Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me  too.  And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her. But it was actually more interesting than that  because she said   I did not think that your intuition was right. I felt my intuition was correct.  So  if you think about all of your intuitions  it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong. And she said   Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ...     she thought her intuition was right    it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong. But in fact  this is the situation we're all in all the time. We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things    our own ability  how the economy works  how we should pay school teachers. But unless we start testing those intuitions  we're not going to do better. And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition  and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions. Thank you very much. About four years ago  the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius. Now  the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean  and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished  all within about     years. Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find  because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton. See  while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection  nobody    not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius    has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo. Well  this isn't exactly true. The fact is  is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the   th century    it was actually mummified  skin and all    but in a fit of space saving zeal  they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire. If you go look at their website today  they'll actually list these specimens  saying  the rest was lost in a fire. Not quite the whole truth. Anyway. The frontispiece of this article was this photo  and I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker  because this photo completely rocked my world. I became obsessed with the object    not just the beautiful photograph itself  and the color  the shallow depth of field  the detail that's visible  the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together    there's an entire story here. And I thought to myself  wouldn't it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton  I want to point out here at this point that I've spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell  and this was the very latest one. So I began looking around for    to see if anyone sold a kit  some kind of model that I could get  and I found lots of reference material  lots of lovely pictures. No dice  no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done. I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my  Creative Projects  folder    it's a repository for my brain  everything that I could possibly be interested in. Any time I have an internet connection  there's a sluice of stuff moving into there  everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos. The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille. Russian nuclear launch key  The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay  the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself  because I couldn't afford the one on eBay. Storm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth    that's one I hand drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder. This folder has        photos    over    gigabytes of information    and it's growing constantly. And one day  a couple of weeks later  it might have been maybe a year later  I was in the art store with my kids  and I was buying some clay tools    we were going to have a craft day. I bought some Super Sculpeys  some armature wire  some various materials. And I looked down at this Sculpey  and I thought  maybe  yeah  maybe I could make my own dodo skull. I should point out at this time    I'm not a sculptor  I'm a hard edged model maker. You give me a drawing  you give me a prop to replicate  you give me a crane  scaffolding  parts from  Star Wars     especially parts from  Star Wars     I can do this stuff all day long. It's exactly how I made my living for    years. But you give me something like this    my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this  it's a maquette for  Star Wars  Episode Two     this is not my thing    this is something other people do    dragons  soft things. However  I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it    I mean  it couldn't be that difficult. So  I started looking at the best photos I could find. I grabbed all the reference  and I found this lovely piece of reference. This is someone selling this on eBay  it was clearly a woman s hand  hopefully a woman's hand. Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand  I made some measurements of her thumb  and I scaled them out to the size of the skull. I blew it up to the actual size  and I began using that  along with all the other reference that I had  comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be  exactly how long  etc. And over a few hours  I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue  I    it's kind of like  you know  you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time  you can't think about the totality. I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton  I just noticed that as I finished this skull  the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be. And one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons  having collected a couple of hundred. I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them. And so button by button  vertebrae by vertebrae  I built my way down. And actually  by the end of the day  I had a reasonable skull  a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis. And again  I kept on going  looking for more reference  every bit of reference I could find    drawings  beautiful photos. This guy    I love this guy  He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler. This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted  and I replicated every last bone and put it in. And after about six weeks  I finished  painted  mounted my own dodo skeleton. You can see that I even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo. And TAP Plastics made me    although I didn't photograph it    a museum vitrine. I don't have the room for this in my house  but I had to finish what I had started. And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me. Again  like I said  my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell  and also making them for myself  obtaining them  appreciating them and diving into them. And in this folder   Creative Projects   there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on  projects that I've already worked on  things that I might want to work on some day  and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch. But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different  that I    you know  I have my own R D   but that's    honestly  relative to sculpting  to me  that's easy. And so I went back and looked through my  Creative Projects  folder  and I happened across the Maltese Falcon. Now  this is funny for me  to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel  because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people  Chandler people and Hammett people  I am absolutely a Chandler person. But in this case  it's not about the author  it's not about the book or the movie or the story  it's about the object in and of itself. And in this case  this object is    plays on a host of levels. First of all  there's the object in the world. This is the  Kniphausen Hawk.  It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around      for a Swedish Count  and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon. Then there is the fictional bird  the one that Hammett created for the book. Built out of words  it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie  in which another object is created  a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words  inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk  and this represents the falcon in the movie. And then there is this fourth level  which is a whole new object in the world  the prop made for the movie  the representative of the thing  becomes  in its own right  a whole other thing  a whole new object of desire. And so now it was time to do some research. I actually had done some research a few years before    it's why the folder was there. I'd bought a replica  a really crappy replica  of the Maltese Falcon on eBay  and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference. But I discovered  in researching further  really wanting precise reference  that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in       and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue  and in it I found this magnificent picture  which included a size reference. I was able to scan the picture  blow it up to exactly full size. I found other reference. Avi  Ara  Chekmayan  a New Jersey editor  actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in       although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications  because there was a lot of controversy about it. It was made out of resin  which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made. It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it  because I can see it compared to this thing  and I can tell you    it's real  it's the real thing  it's made from the exact same mold that this one is. In this one  because the auction was actually so controversial  Profiles in History  the auction house that sold this    I think in      for about         dollars    they actually included    you can see here on the bottom    not just a front elevation  but also a side  rear and other side elevation. So now  I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon. What do they do  how do you start something like that  I really don't know. So what I did was  again  like I did with the dodo skull  I blew all my reference up to full size  and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references. So I took Sculpey  and I built a big block of it  and I passed it through until  you know  I got the right profiles. And then slowly  feather by feather  detail by detail  I worked out and achieved    working in front of the television and Super Sculpey    here's me sitting next to my wife    it's the only picture I took of the entire process. As I moved through  I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon. But again  I am not a sculptor  and so I don't know a lot of the tricks  like  I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful  shiny surfaces with his Sculpey  I certainly wasn't able to get it. So  I went down to my shop  and I molded it and I cast it in resin  because in the resin  then  I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished. Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish. My preference is about    coats of this    matte black auto primer. I spray it on for about three or four days  it drips to hell  but it allows me a really  really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass smooth. Oh  finishing up with triple zero steel wool. Now  the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie  when they finally bring out the bird at the end  and they place it on the table  they actually spin it. So I was able to actually screen shot and freeze frame to make sure. And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light in the same position  I'm getting the same type of reflection on it    that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing. I ended up with this  my Maltese Falcon. And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority at this point in time  when I'd finished it  of all of the replicas out there    and there is a few    this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one  I should tell you  is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton. This is where it gets weird. Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy  George Hodel. Terrifying guy    agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia. Now  James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton  the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon  killed James Elroy's mother. I'll go you one stranger than that  In       during the production of a weird comedy sequel to  The Maltese Falcon   called  The Black Bird   starring George Segal  the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon    one of the original six plasters  I think  made for the movie    stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie. John's Grill  which actually is seen briefly in  The Maltese Falcon   is still a viable San Francisco eatery  counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook  who played Wilmer Cook in the movie  and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon. And they had it in their cabinet for about    years  until it got stolen in January of     . It would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly. So here I had this Falcon  and it was lovely. It looked really great  the light worked on it really well  it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world. But there was a problem. And the problem was that  I wanted the entirety of the object  I wanted the weight behind the object. This thing was made of resin and it was too light. There's this group online that I frequent. It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum  and it's people who trade  make and travel in information about movie props. And it turned out that one of the guys there  a friend of mine that I never actually met  but befriended through some prop deals  was the manager of a local foundry. He took my master Falcon pattern  he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me  and this is the bronze I got back. And this is  after some acid etching  the one that I ended up with. And this thing  it's deeply  deeply satisfying to me. Here  I'm going to put it out there  later on tonight  and I want you to pick it up and handle it. You want to know how obsessed I am. This project's only for me  and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a      Chinese San Francisco based newspaper  in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ... like it is in the movie. Yeah  I know  There you can see  it's weighing in at    and a half pounds. That's half the weight of my dog  Huxley. But there's a problem. Now  here's the most recent progression of Falcons. On the far left is a piece of crap    a replica I bought on eBay. There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon  because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting  there's my master and there's my bronze. There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things  which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin  you lose a little bit of volume  you lose a little bit of size. And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one  it was shorter by three quarters of an inch. Yeah  no  really  this was like aah    why didn't I remember this  Why didn't I start and make it bigger  So what do I do  I figure I have two options. One  I can fire a freaking laser at it  which I have already done  to do a  D scan    there's a  D scan of this Falcon. I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a  D lithography master of this  which I will polish  then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze. Or  There are several people who own originals  and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them  hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds  maybe to take a picture  or even to pull out the hand held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box  and could maybe  without even touching their bird  I swear  get a perfect  D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages saying that I'll never let anyone else have it  except for me in my office  I promise. I'll give them one if they want it. And then  maybe  then I'll achieve the end of this exercise. But really  if we're all going to be honest with ourselves  I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with  was it. Thank you. I don't know what the hell I'm doing here. I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada  and dropped out of high school. I don't own a cell phone  and I paint on paper using gouache  which hasn't changed in     years. But about three years ago I had an art show in New York  and I titled it  Serious Nonsense.  So I think I'm actually the first one here    I lead. I called it  Serious Nonsense  because on the serious side  I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it    it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal. And meanwhile  I use nonsense  as you can see. This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors  and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor    which you can't see there. This was one of a series called  Zany Afternoons   which became a book. This is a home built rocket propelled car. That's a      Henry J    I'm a bug for authenticity    in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo. This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film. You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town. My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it. And I work a lot in what I call  retrofuturism   which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow. And they're always wrong  always hilariously  optimistically wrong. And the peak time for that was the   s  because the Depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future ... and technology was going to carry us along. This is Popular Workbench. Popular science magazines in those days    I had a huge collection of them from the '  s    all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at     miles an hour    it's all going to happen  it's all going to be wonderful. Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties. I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter  so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject. Detroit has always been halfway into the future    the advertising half. This is the '   Bulgemobile  so new  they make tomorrow look like yesterday. This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car. That's from a whole catalog    it's    pages or so    ran back in the days of the Lampoon  where I cut my teeth. Techno archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened    for good reason  usually. The zeppelin    this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based  obviously  on the Hindenburg. But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man. And it carried    people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark  and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the Normandie to fly it. So the Hindenburg wasn't  you know  it was inevitable it was going to go. This is auto gyro jousting in Malibu in the   s. The auto gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter  but it should have    it wasn't a big success. It's the only Spanish innovation  technologically  of the   th century  by the way. You needed to know that. The flying car which never got off the ground    it was a post war dream. My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car. This is pitched into the future from       looking at the day all American families have them.  There's Moscow  Shirley. Hope they speak Esperanto   Faux nostalgia  which I'm sort of    not  say  famous for  but I work an awful lot in it. It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened. Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion    so I think that s a case for serious play. This is emblematic of it    this is wing dining  recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the   s  dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here  but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away. This is tank polo in the South Hamptons. The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that. And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense. I think it adds a huge amount. Those  for example  are Mark IV British tanks from     . They had two machine guns and a cannon  and they had    horsepower Ricardo engines. They went five miles an hour and inside it was     degrees in the pitch dark. And they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the Germans weren't going to use gas. Happy little story  isn't it  This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the   s  where you drove up to your front door  if you had the guts. Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there. I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm. And I love cigars    there's a cigar billboard down there. And faux nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war. This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in       when a Messerschmitt ME    bursts into the House of Commons and buzzes around  just to piss off Churchill  who's down there somewhere. It's a fond memory of times past. Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit  just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did    a brochure again     RMS Tyrannic  The Biggest Thing in All the World.  The copy  which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages  says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over  and it's so safe it carries no insurance. It's obviously modeled on the Titanic. But it's not a cri de coeur about man's hubris in the face of the elements. It's just a sick  silly joke. Shamelessly cheap is something  I think    this will wake you up. It has no meaning  just    Desoto discovers the Mississippi  and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi. I did that as a quick back page    I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon  and I did that  and I thought   Well  I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it.  People wrote in for reprints of that thing. Urban absurdism    that's what the New Yorker really calls for. I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers. I've done about    of them  and I'd say    of them are based on that concept. I was driving down  th Avenue one night at   a.m.  and this steam pouring out of the street  and I thought   What causes that   And that    who s to say  The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York    it's a very somber place. I thought I could jazz it up a bit  have a little fun with it. This is a very un PC cover. Not in New York. I couldn't resist  and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying   This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed  please apologize on our website.  Haven't got around to it yet but    I may. This is the word side of my brain. I love the word  Eurotrash.  That's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs. This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France. If you live in New York  you know how the bike messengers move. Except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff    they all do    and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France    sign of our times  I guess. This is the only fashion cover I've ever done. It's the little old lady that lives in a shoe  and then this thing    the title of that was   There Goes the Neighborhood.  I don't know a hell of a lot about fashion    I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane  and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying   Put a strap on it      No  don't put a strap on it      Put a strap on it     Don't put a strap on it     because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it's bad and    I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe. This is a tiny joke    E ZR pass. One letter makes an idea. This is a big joke. This is the audition for  King Kong.  People always ask me  where do you get your ideas  how do your ideas come  Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover  in the middle of the night  this came to me like a Xerox    all I had to do was write it down. It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it. And then when it ran  a lovely lady  an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg    if you know that name    called me and said she loved the cover  it was so sweet. Her former name was Fay Wray  and so that was    I didn't have the wit to say   Take the painting.  Finally  this was a three page cover  never done before  and I don't think it will ever be done again    successive pages in the front of the magazine. It's the ascent of man using an escalator  and it's in three parts. You can't see it all together  unfortunately  but if you look at it enough  you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move. Pretty elegant. Nothing like a crash to end a joke. That completes my oeuvre. I would just like to add a crass commercial    I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called  Marvel Sandwiches   a compendium of all the serious play that ever was  and it s going to be available in fine bookstores  crummy bookstores  tables on the street in October. So thank you very much. Some    years ago  I became allergic to Delhi's air. My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to    percent  and it was killing me. With the help of IIT  TERI  and learnings from NASA  we discovered that there are three basic green plants  common green plants  with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy. We've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building  while maintaining industry indoor air quality standards. The three plants are Areca palm  Mother in Law's Tongue and money plant. The botanical names are in front of you. Areca palm is a plant which removes CO  and converts it into oxygen. We need four shoulder high plants per person  and in terms of plant care  we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi  and perhaps once a week in cleaner air cities. We had to grow them in vermi manure  which is sterile  or hydroponics  and take them outdoors every three to four months. The second plant is Mother in law's Tongue  which is again a very common plant  and we call it a bedroom plant  because it converts CO  into oxygen at night. And we need six to eight waist high plants per person. The third plant is money plant  and this is again a very common plant  preferably grows in hydroponics. And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals. With these three plants  you can grow all the fresh air you need. In fact  you could be in a bottle with a cap on top  and you would not die at all  and you would not need any fresh air. We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi  which is a        square feet     year old building. And it has close to       such plants for     occupants. Our studies have found that there is a    percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for    hours. The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi. And the study showed that  compared to other buildings  there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by    percent  respiratory systems by    percent  headaches by    percent  lung impairment by    percent and asthma by nine percent. And this study has been published on September          and it's available on the government of India website. Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over    percent by using these plants. And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding    percent  because you need less fresh air. We are now replicating this in a  .   million square feet building  which will have        indoor plants. Why is this important  It is also important for the environment  because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by    percent in the next decade.    percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently  and    percent of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next    years. And there is a growing preference for living and working in air conditioned places.  Be the change you want to see in the world   said Mahatma Gandhi. And thank you for listening. If you're at all like me  this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco  you build experimental kite powered hydrofoils capable of more than    knots. And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind  and it can do amazing things. And one day  a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record. But kites aren't just toys like this. Kites  I'm going to give you a brief history  and tell you about the magnificent future of every child's favorite plaything. So  kites are more than a thousand years old  and the Chinese used them for military applications  and even for lifting men. So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights. I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man. In       a fellow called George Pocock actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies in races against horse carriages across the English countryside. Then of course  at the dawn of aviation  all of the great inventors of the time    like Hargreaves  like Langley  even Alexander Graham Bell  inventor of the telephone  who was flying this kite    were doing so in the pursuit of aviation. Then these two fellows came along  and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight. So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright  and the Wright Flyer. And their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion  where we powered up and took off for the first ever    second human flight. And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation. But unfortunately  it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys. That was until the     s  where we had the last energy crisis. And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco  wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the Journal of Energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity. The real key observation he made is that a free flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed wing turbine. So turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height  but they can't really go a lot higher  and more height is where the more wind is  and more power    as much as twice as much. So cut to now. We still have an energy crisis  and now we have a climate crisis as well. You know  so humans generate about    trillion watts  or    terawatts  from fossil fuels. And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets  and in reality what that means is in the next    to    years  we have to make    trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow. Wind is the second largest renewable resource after solar       terawatts  more than enough to supply humanity     times over. The majority of it is in the higher altitudes  above     feet  where we don't have a technology as yet to get there. So this is the dawn of the new age of kites. This is our test site on Maui  flying across the sky. I'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power by every child's favorite plaything. As you can tell  you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours. It makes you a little nauseous. And here we're actually generating about    kilowatts    so  enough to power probably five United States households    with a kite not much larger than this piano. And the real significant thing here is we're developing the control systems  as did the Wright brothers  that would enable sustained  long duration flight. And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either. So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow    that's tracing your name in the sky. And this is where we're actually going. So we're beyond the    second steps. And we're working towards megawatt scale machines that fly at      feet and generate tons of clean electricity. So you ask  how big are those machines  Well  this paper plane would be maybe a    oop  That would be enough to power your cell phone. Your Cessna would be     killowatts. If you'd loan me your Gulfstream  I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt. If you give me a      I'll make six megawatts  which is more than the largest wind turbines today. And the Spruce Goose would be a    megawatt wing. So that is audacious  you say. I agree. But audacious is what has happened many times before in history. This is a refrigerator factory  churning out airplanes for World War II. Prior to World War II  they were making      planes a year. By       they were making        . With this factory and         planes a year  we could make all of America's electricity in about    years. So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams. There are many of us. I am lucky enough to work with    of them. And I think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things. Thank you. I've been working on issues of poverty for more than    years  and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean  So often  we look at dollar terms    people making less than a dollar or two or three a day. And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable. Because really  it's a condition about choice  and the lack of freedom. And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that I have. It was in Kenya  and I want to share it with you. I was with my friend Susan Meiselas  the photographer  in the Mathare Valley slums. Now  Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa. It's about three miles out of Nairobi  and it's a mile long and about two tenths of a mile wide  where over half a million people live crammed in these little tin shacks  generation after generation  renting them  often eight or    people to a room. And it's known for prostitution  violence  drugs  a hard place to grow up. And when we were walking through the narrow alleys  it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes. But at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vitality  the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there  women washing their babies  washing their clothes  hanging them out to dry. I met this woman  Mama Rose  who has rented that little tin shack for    years  where she lives with her seven children. Four sleep in one twin bed  and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor. And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk  and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside. It was also the day after the inauguration  and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe. And I would see kids on the street corners  and they'd say  Obama  he's our brother   And I'd say  Well  Obama's my brother  so that makes you my brother too.  And they would look quizzically  and then be like   High five   And it was here that I met Jane. I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face  and I asked her to tell me her story. She started off by telling me her dream. She said   I had two. My first dream was to be a doctor  and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family  because my mother was a single mom  and couldn't afford to pay for school fees. So I had to give up the first dream  and I focused on the second.  She got married when she was     had a baby right away. And when she turned     found herself pregnant with a second child  her mom died and her husband left her    married another woman. So she was again in Mathare  with no income  no skill set  no money. And so she ultimately turned to prostitution. It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it. She would go into the city at night with about    girls  look for work  and sometimes come back with a few shillings  or sometimes with nothing. And she said   You know  the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all.  In       her life changed. She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization  Jamii Bora  that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were  as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings. And so she spent a year to save    dollars  and started borrowing  and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine. She started tailoring. And that turned into what she does now  which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets  and for about three dollars and    cents she buys an old ball gown. Some of them might be ones you gave. And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons  and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women for their daughter's Sweet    or first Holy Communion    those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate all along the economic spectrum. And she does really good business. In fact  I watched her walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it  there was a crowd of women around her  buying these dresses. And I reflected  as I was watching her sell the dresses  and also the jewelry that she makes  that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day. And by many definitions she is no longer poor. But she still lives in Mathare Valley. And so she can't move out. She lives with all of that insecurity  and in fact  in January  during the ethnic riots  she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack in which she would live. Jamii Bora understands that and understands that when we're talking about poverty  we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum. And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations  loans and investments that will go the long term with them  they built a low cost housing development  about an hour outside Nairobi central. And they designed it from the perspective of customers like Jane herself  insisting on responsibility and accountability. So she has to give    percent of the mortgage    of the total value  or about     dollars in savings. And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty. And in the next couple of weeks  she's going to be among the first     families to move into this development. When I asked her if she feared anything  or whether she would miss anything from Mathare  she said   What would I fear that I haven't confronted already  I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all.  And she said   What would I miss  You think I will miss the violence or the drugs  The lack of privacy  Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home at the end of the day   She said  If you gave me    minutes my bags would be packed.  I said   Well what about your dreams   And she said   Well  you know  my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl. But if I think about it  I thought I wanted a husband  but what I really wanted was a family that was loving. And I fiercely love my children  and they love me back.  She said   I thought that I wanted to be a doctor  but what I really wanted to be was somebody who served and healed and cured. And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have  that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients. And I say  'Look at me. You are not dead. You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'  And she said   I'm not a doctor who gives out pills. But maybe me  I give out something better because I give them hope.  And in the middle of this economic crisis  where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear  I think we're well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out  recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary. Because when systems are broken  like the ones that we're seeing around the world  it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation. It's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings  so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves. I truly believe it's where dignity starts. We owe it to the Janes of the world. And just as important  we owe it to ourselves. Thank you. I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times. I review gadgets and stuff. And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree. What I'm mostly doing this year is going on cable TV and answering the same question   What are the tech trends for next year   And I'm like   Didn't we just go through this last year   But I'm going to pick the one that interests me most  and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the Internet. You know  I found that volcano on Google Images  not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics. Anyway  this all started a few years ago  when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line  and we've come a long way since that. But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage. Basically you take an ordinary telephone  you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem. Now  it works just like a regular phone. So you can pick up the phone  you hear a dial tone  but its just a fake out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone  just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended. It could be anything. It could be salsa music or a comedy routine    it doesn't matter. The little box has your phone number. So that's really cool    you can take it to London or Siberia  and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring  because it's got everything in the box. They've got every feature known to man in there  because adding a new feature is just software. And as a result of Voice Over IP    I hate that term    Voice Over Internet    land line home phone service has gone down    percent in the last three years. I mean  no self respecting college kid has home phone service anymore. This is what college kids are more likely to have. It's the most popular VOIP service in the world  It's Skype. It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC  and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd. It's not your phone    it's your computer. But nonetheless  if you're a college kid and you have no money  believe me  this is better than trying to use your cell phone. It's really cute seeing middle aged people like me  try out Skype for the first time  which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad. They don't want to pay the international fees  so they're like   Timmy  Is that you   It's really cute. But I    at least it was when I did it    I think where VOIP is really going to get interesting is when they start putting it on cell phones. Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone  and any time you were in a wireless hotspot    free calls anywhere in the world  never pay the cellular company a nickel. It'd be really  really cool    and yet  even though the technology for this has been available for five years  incredibly  the number of standard cell phones offered by US carriers with free VOIP is zero  I can't figure out why  Actually  I need to update that. There's one now. And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it. It comes from T Mobile. And I am not paid by T Mobile. I'm not plugging T Mobile. The New York Times has very rigid policies about that. Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us. Basically  the reason you haven't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on June   . Does anyone remember what else happened on June    last year  It was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day. I'm like  can you imagine being the T Mobile PR lady  You know   Hi  we have an announcement to    WAH     But it's actually really  really cool. You have a choice of phones  and we're not talking smartphones    ordinary phones  including a Blackberry  that have Wi Fi. The deal is  any time you're in a Wi Fi hotspot  all your calls are free. And when you're out of the hotspot  you're on the regular cellular network. You're thinking   Well  how often am I in a hotspot   The answer is   All the time   Because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone  for your house. Which is really ingenious  because we all know that T Mobile is the most pathetic carrier. They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail. But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right  They don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us a seven dollar and    cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program. We're putting it in our homes for them  Anyway  they have Wi Fi phones in Europe. But the thing that T Mobile did that nobody's done before is  when you're on a call an you move from Wi Fi into cellular range  the call is handed off in mid syllable  seamlessly. I'll show you the advanced technologies we use at the New York Times to test this gear. This is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this. As I walk out of the house from my Wi Fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife    look at the upper left. That's the Wi Fi signal. David Pogue  Hi babes  it's me. JP  Oh  hi darling  how are you  DP  You're on Wi Fi. How does it sound  JP  Oh  it sounds pretty good. Now  I'm leaving the house. DP  I'm going for a walk    do you mind  JP  No not at all. I'm having a great day with the kids. DP  What are you guys doing  Right there  It just changed to the cellular tower in mid call. I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that. The bottom line is that the boundaries  because of the Internet plus cell phone  are melting. The cool thing about the T Mobile phones is that although switching technologies is very advanced  the billing technology has not caught up. So what I mean is that you can start a call in your house in the Wi Fi hotspot  you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead    which would be like    minutes    And the call will continue to be free. Because they don't  they haven't    well  no  wait  Not so fast. It also works the other way. So if you start a call on your cellular network and you come home  you keep being billed. Which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying   Hey  I just got home. Can I call you right back   Now you get it. It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas  it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in. On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog  right  Nobody knows you're in Pakistan. You can make free unlimited calls home to the US with these phones. So  very  very interesting. This is another favorite of mine. Does anyone here have a working cell phone that's on  with coverage  who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing  OK. Would you call me please right now   Phone number given.  And don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer. I have two cell phones  so this going to be very odd  if it works. I should know not to do technology demos in front of an audience. It's just  like  absurd. This one is going off. And    oh  I have the ringer off. Tsh  Great. Anyway  this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time. Excuse me one second. Hello  Oh. Where are you calling from  No  no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that. I didn't even know it was you    I was looking at this guy. Oh great  Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now  All right  We've made the point. All right. Ringer off. Everyone wants in on the action. So this is Grand Central at work    it's a    oh  for gods sake  I have your numbers now  You will pay. Grand Central is this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number  and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once. Your home phone  your work phone  your cell phone  your yacht phone The beauty of that is you never miss a call. I know a lot of you are like   Ooh  I don't want to be reached at any hour.  But the beauty is it's all going through the internet  so you get all of these really cool features    like you can say  I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours. And I want these people to hear this greeting   Hi boss  I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message.  And then your wife calls  and   Hi honey  leave me a message.  Very  very customizable. Google bought it  and they've been working on it for a year. They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method. By the way  this is something that really bothers me. I don't know if you realize this. When you call     on your cell phone  they charge you two bucks. Did you know that  It's an outrage. I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there. I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now. What you're going to use is Google Cellular. It's totally free    there's not even ads. If you know how to send a text message  you can get the same information for free. I'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it. You send a text message to the word  Google   which turns out to be      . Leave off the last  e  for savings. Anyway  so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago. You type  pharmacy Chicago   or the zip code. You hit send  and in five seconds  they will send you back the two closest drugstores  complete with name address and phone number. Here it comes. And it's already written down    so  like  if you're driving  you don't have to do one of these things   Uh huh  uh huh  uh huh.  It works with weather  too. You can say  Weather   and the name of the city you're going to travel to. And then in five seconds  they send you back the complete weather forecast for that town. Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan. Here we go. And those are just the beginning. These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will    yeah  You're all trying to write this down. That's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me. It's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside is that it requires you to know how to text    send a text message. Nobody over    knows how to do that. So I'm going to teach you something even better. This is called Google Info. They've just launched this voice activated version of the same thing. It's speech recognition like you've never heard before. So lets say I'm in Monterey  and I want what  I want to find what  Bagels. OK. Google  Say the business and the city and state. DP  Bagels  Monterey  California. I got the Chinese line. Google  Bagels  Monterey  California. Top eight results  Number one  Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street. To select number one  you can press one or say  number one.  Number two  Bagel Bakery  commissary department. Number Two. Number Two. Two. Why do I listen to people in the audience  Well anyway    oh  Here we go  Google  ... commissary department on McClellan Avenue  Monterey. I'll connect you  or say  details   or  go back.  DP  He's connecting me  He doesn't even tell me the phone number. He's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet. Google  Hold on. DP  Hi  could I have     with a schmear  No  no  no    just kidding  no no. So anyway  you never even find out the number. It's just so amazing. And it has incredible  incredible accuracy. This is even more amazing. Put this in your speed dial. This you can ask by voice any question. Who won the      World Series  What's the recipe for a certain cocktail  It's absolutely amazing    and they text you back the answer. I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.  Which actors have played James Bond   They text me back this   Sean Connery  George Lazenby  Roger Moore  Timothy Dalton  Pierce Brosnan  Daniel Craig.  Right  And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl. I'm like   What's the word that means you know  like  when the sun  the moon and the earth are  like  all in a line   Just to see how the recognition was. They texted me back   It's called a syzygy.  Which I knew  because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in     . You know  there's a lot of people wondering   How on earth are they going to make money doing this   And the answer is  look at the last line. They put this teeny weeny little ad  about    characters long. And a lot of people also want to know   How does it work  How can it be so good  It's as though there is a human being on the other end of the line.  Because there is one  They have        people who are being paid    cents per answer. As you can imagine  it's college kids and old people. That's who can afford to do that. But it's a human being on the line. And it's gotten me out of so many tough positions like   When's the last flight out of Chicago   You know. It's just absolutely amazing. Another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today    this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology. When I call to leave you a message  I get    seconds of instructions from a third grade teacher on Ambien   To page this person ...   Page  What is this        Nobody has pagers anymore.  You may begin speaking at the tone. When you have finished recording  you may hang up.  No  And then it gets worse  when I call to retrieve my messages  first of all   You have    messages. To listen to your messages ...   Why else am I calling  Of course I want to listen to the messages  Oh  You all have cell phones too. So last year I went to Milan  Italy  and I got to speak to an audience of cellular executives from     countries around the world. And I said as a joke    as a joke  I said   I did the math. Verizon has    million customers. If you check your voicemail twice a day  that's     million dollars a year. I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime  aren't you   No chuckle. They're like this    Where is the outrage  people  Rise up  Sorry. I'm not bitter. So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that. There are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text. And they send it either to your email or as text messages to your phone. It is a life changer. And by the way  they don't always get the words right  because it's over the phone and all that. So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check. The services are called things like Spinvox  Phonetag    this is the one I use    Callwave. A lot of people say   How are they doing this  I don't really want people listening in to my calls.  The executives at these companies told me   Well we use a proprietary B to B  best of breed  peer to peer soluti      you know. I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets  you know  listening in. The reason I think that is that on the first day I tried one of these services  I got two voicemail messages. One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson  which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe  and it was misspelled. The other was from my video producer at the Times  whose name is Vijaiy Singh  with the silent 'h'. Nailed that one. So you be the judge. Anyway  this service  Callwave  promises that it's all software    nobody is listening to your messages. And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist of your messages. So I thought I'd see how that goes. This is me testing it out. Hope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good. Hey  I was walking along the street and the sky was blue. And your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice. I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch. She's in room    emergency room   W. OK  talk to you later    bye. I love my job. So a couple minutes later  this I got by email. It's a very good transcription. But a couple minutes after that  I got the text message version. Now remember  a text message can only be     characters long. So it had better be the gist of the gist  right  I'm not kidding you. The message said   Was walking along the street  and  sky was blue  and  emergency   What the f      Well I guess that was the gist. And lastly  I just have to talk about this one. This is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com. Basically  you're going to go on some iffy date  or a potentially bad meeting. So you go and you type in your phone number  and at the exact minute where you want to be called    And at that moment your phone will ring. And you're like   I'm sorry. I've got to take this.  The really beautiful thing is  you know how when somebody's sitting next to you  sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller. So they give you a choice of what you want to hear on the other end. Here's the girlfriend. Phone  Hey you  what's going on  DP  I'm kinda  like  giving a talk right now. Phone  Well  that's good. DP  What are you doing  Phone  I was just wondering what you were up to. DP  Right  I can't really talk right now. This is the    I love this    the boss call. Phone  Hey  this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office. DP  Oh  hi  sir. Phone  Did you complete that thing about a month ago  That photocopier training  DP  Oh    sorry I forgot. Phone  Yeah  well so when was the last time you used the photocopier  DP  It was like three weeks ago. Phone  Well  I don't know if you heard  you might have heard from Lenny  but    I think the biggest change when Internet met phone was with the iPhone. Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism. It was when in the fall of       I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone. I looked like a moron. However  my logic was good  because    I don't know if you realize this  but    until the iPhone came along  the carriers    Verizon  AT T  Cingular    held veto power over every aspect of every design of every phone. I know the people who worked on the Treo. They went around to these carriers and said   Look at these cool features.  And Verizon is like   Hmm  no. I don't think so.  It was not very conducive to innovation. What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs went around and said   Tell you what    I'll give you a five year exclusive if you'll let me design this phone in peace    and you won't even see it till it's done.  Actually  even so  he was turned down by Verizon and others. Finally Cingular said OK. I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone. Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go   What are you  An Apple fan boy     you know. I'm not. You can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece. It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now. But it did change a few things. The first thing it changed was that all those carriers saw that they sold    million of these things in a year. And they said   Oh my gosh  maybe we've been doing it wrong. Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones.  Another thing was that it let    million people  for the first time  experience being online all the time. Not using these    dollar a month cellular cards for their laptops. I don't understand why we're not there yet. When I'm an old man  I'm going to tell my grandchildren   When I was your age  if I wanted to check my email  I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop. I did    We had wireless base stations that could broadcast    yay  about     feet across.  It's absurd. We have power outlets in every room of every building. We have running water. What's the problem  Anyway    but this teaches people what it's like. You have to go to YouTube and type in  iPhone Shuffle.  This guy did a mock video of one that's one inch square  like the real iPod Shuffle. It's like   It only has one button. Touch it and it dials a number at random.   Who the hell is this   But the other thing it did is it opened up this idea of an app store. It downloads right to the phone. And you can use the tilt sensor to steer this car using this game. These programs can use all the components of the iPhone    the touch screen. This is the Etch A Sketch program    the theme of EG     . You know how you erase it  Of course. You shake it. Right  of course. We shake it to erase  like this. They have        of these programs. This is the translator program. They have every language in the world. You type in what you want  and it gives you the translation. This is amazing. This is Midomi. A song is running through your head    you sing it into the thing  do do do do do  da da da da da da  da dum ... OK  you tap   Done  and it will find out the song and play it for you. I know. It's insane  right  This is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio    you type in a band or a song name. It will immediately play you that song or that band. It has a thumbs up and a thumbs down. You say if you like this song or not. If you like it  it tries another song on you from a different band  with the same instrumentation  vocals  theme and tempo. If you like that one  or don't like it  you do thumbs up and thumbs down. Over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs. It eventually only plays songs you like. This is Urbanspoon. You're in a city. It knows from GPS where you're standing. You want to find a place to eat. You shake it. It proposes a restaurant. It gives you the price  and the location and ratings. Video  I'm not going all the way to Flushing. Anyway  just amazing  amazing things. Of course  its not just about the iPhone. The iPhone broke the dyke  the wall. But now it's everybody else. So Google has done their own Android operating system that will soon be on handsets    phones from    companies. Touch screen    very  very nice. Also with its own app store  where you can download programs. This is amazing. In the wake of all this  Verizon  the most calcified  corporate  conservative carrier of all  said   You can use any phone you want on our network.  I love the Wired headline  Pigs Fly  Hell Freezes Over and Verizon Opens Up Its Network    No. Really. So everything is changing. We've entered a new world of innovation  where the cell phone becomes your laptop  customized the way you want it. Every cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on. Can I do one more one minute song  Thank you. Just to round it up    this is the new Apple Power Music Stand. It's only three pounds  or    if you install Microsoft Office. Sorry  that was mean. This is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video. Ladies and gentlemen  for seven blissful hours it was the number one video on YouTube. And now the end is near. I'm sick to death of this old cell phone. Bad sound  the signal's weak  the software stinks. A made in Hell phone. I've heard there's something new    a million times more rad than my phone. I too will join the cult. I want an iPhone. Concerns    I have a few. It's got some flaws  we may just face it. No keys  no memory card  the battery's sealed    you can't replace it. But God  this thing is sweet. A multitouch  iPod  Wi Fi phone. You had me from   Hello.  I want an iPhone. I want to touch its precious screen. I want to wipe the smudges clean. I want my friends to look and drool. I want to say   Look    now I'm cool  I stood in line and I'll get mine. I want an iPhone. For what is a man  What has he got  If not iPhone  then he's got squat. It's all the things a phone should be. Who cares if it's AT T  I took a stand  paid half a grand  And I got an iPhone  Thank you. Thank you very much. I coined my own definition of success in       when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend  Indiana  being a little bit disappointed  and  disillusioned  perhaps  by the way parents of the youngsters in my English classes expected their youngsters to get an A or a B. They thought a C was all right for the neighbors' children  because they were all average. But they weren't satisfied when their own    it would make the teacher feel that they had failed  or the youngster had failed. And that's not right. The good Lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned  any more than we're equal for size  appearance. Not everybody could earn an A or a B  and I didn't like that way of judging  and I did know how the alumni of various schools back in the '  s judged coaches and athletic teams. If you won them all  you were considered to be reasonably successful    not completely. Because I found out    we had a number of years at UCLA where we didn't lose a game. But it seemed that we didn't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted    And quite frequently I really felt that they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic manner. But that was true back in the   s  so I understood that. But I didn't like it  I didn't agree with it. I wanted to come up with something I hoped could make me a better teacher  and give the youngsters under my supervision  be it in athletics or the English classroom  something to which to aspire  other than just a higher mark in the classroom  or more points in some athletic contest. I thought about that for quite a spell  and I wanted to come up with my own definition. I thought that might help. And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it  as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige  or something of that sort  worthy accomplishments perhaps  but in my opinion  not necessarily indicative of success. So I wanted to come up with something of my own. And I recalled    I was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana  and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else. I'm sure at the time he did that  I didn't    it didn't    well  somewhere  I guess in the hidden recesses of the mind  it popped out years later. Never try to be better than someone else  always learn from others. Never cease trying to be the best you can be    that's under your control. If you get too engrossed and involved and concerned in regard to the things over which you have no control  it will adversely affect the things over which you have control. Then I ran across this simple verse that said   At God's footstool to confess  a poor soul knelt  and bowed his head. 'I failed ' he cried. The Master said  'Thou didst thy best  that is success.'  From those things  and one other perhaps  I coined my own definition of success  which is  Peace of mind attained only through self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable. I believe that's true. If you make the effort to do the best of which you're capable  trying to improve the situation that exists for you  I think that's success  and I don't think others can judge that  it's like character and reputation    your reputation is what you're perceived to be  your character is what you really are. And I think that character is much more important than what you are perceived to be. You'd hope they'd both be good  but they won't necessarily be the same. Well  that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters. I ran across other things. I love to teach  and it was mentioned by the previous speaker that I enjoy poetry  and I dabble in it a bit  and love it. There are some things that helped me  I think  be better than I would have been. I know I'm not what I ought to be  what I should be  but I think I'm better than I would have been if I hadn't run across certain things. One was just a little verse that said   No written word  no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be  nor all the books on all the shelves    it's what the teachers are themselves.  That made an impression on me in the     s. And I tried to use that more or less in my teaching  whether it be in sports  or whether it be in the English classroom. I love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow. Maybe it's because Dad used to read to us at night  by coal oil lamp    we didn't have electricity in our farm home. And Dad would read poetry to us. So I always liked it. And about the same time I ran across this one verse  I ran across another one. Someone asked a lady teacher why she taught  and after some time  she said she wanted to think about that. Then she came up and said   They ask me why I teach  and I reply  'Where could I find such splendid company ' There sits a statesman  strong  unbiased  wise  another Daniel Webster  silver tongued. A doctor sits beside him  whose quick  steady hand may mend a bone  or stem the life blood's flow. And there a builder  upward rise the arch of a church he builds  wherein that minister may speak the word of God  and lead a stumbling soul to touch the Christ. And all about  a gathering of teachers  farmers  merchants  laborers    those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow. And I may say  I may not see the church  or hear the word  or eat the food their hands may grow  but yet again I may  And later I may say  I knew him once  and he was weak  or strong  or bold or proud or gay. I knew him once  but then he was a boy. They ask me why I teach and I reply  'Where could I find such splendid company '  And I believe the teaching profession    it's true  you have so many youngsters  and I've got to think of my youngsters at UCLA       some attorneys     dentists and doctors  many  many teachers and other professions. And that gives you a great deal of pleasure  to see them go on. I always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education  number one  basketball was second  because it was paying their way  and they do need a little time for social activities  but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two  and you're not going to have any very long. So that was the idea that I tried to get across to the youngsters under my supervision. I had three rules  pretty much  that I stuck with practically all the time. I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA  and I decided they were very important. One was  Never be late.  Later on I said certain things    the players  if we were leaving for somewhere  had to be neat and clean. There was a time when I made them wear jackets and shirts and ties. Then I saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks  and thought  it's not right for me to keep this other  rule  so I let them just    they had to be neat and clean. I had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of  Bill Walton. He came to catch the bus  we were leaving for somewhere to play. And he wasn't clean and neat  so I wouldn't let him go. He couldn't get on the bus  he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport. So I was a stickler for that. I believed in that. I believe in time  very important. I believe you should be on time  but I felt at practice  for example    we start on time  we close on time. The youngsters didn't have to feel that we were going to keep them over. When I speak at coaching clinics  I often tell young coaches    and at coaching clinics  more or less  they'll be the younger coaches getting in the profession. Most of them are young  you know  and probably newly married. And I tell them   Don't run practices late  because you'll go home in a bad mood  and that's not good  for a young married man to go home in a bad mood. When you get older  it doesn't make any difference  but     So I did believe  on time. I believe starting on time  and I believe closing on time. And another one I had was  not one word of profanity. One word of profanity  and you are out of here for the day. If I see it in a game  you're going to come out and sit on the bench. And the third one was  never criticize a teammate. I didn't want that. I used to tell them I was paid to do that. That's my job. I'm paid to do it. Pitifully poor  but I am paid to do it. Not like the coaches today  for gracious sakes  no. It's a little different than it was in my day. Those were three things that I stuck with pretty closely all the time. And those actually came from my dad. That's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time. I came up with a pyramid eventually  that I don't have the time to go on that. But that helped me  I think  become a better teacher. It's something like this  And I had blocks in the pyramid  and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm  working hard and enjoying what you're doing  coming up to the apex  according to my definition of success. And right at the top  faith and patience. And I say to you  in whatever you're doing  you must be patient. You have to have patience to    we want things to happen. We talk about our youth being impatient a lot  and they are. They want to change everything. They think all change is progress. And we get a little older    we sort of let things go. And we forget there is no progress without change. So you must have patience  and I believe that we must have faith. I believe that we must believe  truly believe. Not just give it word service  believe that things will work out as they should  providing we do what we should. I think our tendency is to hope things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time  but we don't do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality. I worked on this for some    years  and I think it helped me become a better teacher. But it all revolved around that original definition of success. You know  a number of years ago  there was a Major League Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty. He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'. I'd never seen that before  but he did. Big league baseball players    they're very perceptive about those things  and they noticed he had only one 'i' in his name. You'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head at various times. But he wrote something where I think he did what I tried to do in this pyramid. He called it  The Road Ahead  or the Road Behind.  He said   Sometimes I think the Fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can't win  is the Fates themselves have missed. Yet there lives on the ancient claim  we win or lose within ourselves. The shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow's game. You and I know deeper down  there's always a chance to win the crown. But when we fail to give our best  we simply haven't met the test  of giving all and saving none until the game is really won  of showing what is meant by grit  of playing through when others quit  of playing through  not letting up. It's bearing down that wins the cup. Of dreaming there's a goal ahead  of hoping when our dreams are dead  of praying when our hopes have fled  yet losing  not afraid to fall  if  bravely  we have given all. For who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span. Giving all  it seems to me  is not so far from victory. And so the Fates are seldom wrong  no matter how they twist and wind. It's you and I who make our fates    we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind.  Reminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us  Don't whine. Don't complain. Don't make excuses. Just get out there  and whatever you're doing  do it to the best of your ability. And no one can do more than that. I tried to get across  too  that    my opponents will tell you    you never heard me mention winning. Never mention winning. My idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game  and you can win when you're outscored. I've felt that way on certain occasions  at various times. And I just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game. I used to say that when a game is over  and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome  I hope they couldn't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you. That's what really matters  if you make an effort to do the best you can regularly  the results will be about what they should be. Not necessarily what you'd want them to be but they'll be about what they should  only you will know whether you can do that. And that's what I wanted from them more than anything else. And as time went by  and I learned more about other things  I think it worked a little better  as far as the results. But I wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things  and not the end itself. I believe it was one great philosopher who said    no  no    Cervantes. Cervantes said   The journey is better than the end.  And I like that. I think that it is    it's getting there. Sometimes when you get there  there's almost a let down. But it's the getting there that's the fun. As a basketball coach at UCLA  I liked our practices to be the journey  and the game would be the end  the end result. I liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play  and see whether I'd done a decent job during the week. There again  it's getting the players to get that self satisfaction  in knowing that they'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable. Sometimes I'm asked who was the best player I had  or the best teams. I can never answer that. As far as the individuals are concerned    I was asked one time about that  and they said   Suppose that you  in some way  could make the perfect player. What would you want   And I said   Well  I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA  to get an education  he was a good student  really knew why he was there in the first place. But I'd want one that could play  too. I'd want one to realize that defense usually wins championships  and who would work hard on defense. But I'd want one who would play offense  too. I'd want him to be unselfish  and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time. And I'd want one that could pass and would pass. I've had some that could and wouldn't  and I've had some that would and could. So  yeah  I'd want that. And I wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside. I wanted them to be good inside too. I'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends  too. Why not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that. He had the qualifications. Not the only one  but he was one that I used in that particular category  because I think he made the effort to become the best. There was a couple. I mention in my book   They Call Me Coach   two players that gave me great satisfaction  that came as close as I think anyone I ever had to reach their full potential  one was Conrad Burke  and one was Doug McIntosh. When I saw them as freshmen  on our freshmen team    freshmen couldn't play varsity when I taught. I thought   Oh gracious  if these two players  either one of them     they were different years  but I thought about each one at the time he was there     Oh  if he ever makes the varsity  our varsity must be pretty miserable  if he's good enough to make it.  And you know  one of them was a starting player for a season and a half. The other one  his next year  played    minutes in a national championship game  Did a tremendous job for us. The next year  he was a starting player on the national championship team  and here I thought he'd never play a minute  when he was    so those are the things that give you great joy  and great satisfaction to see. Neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well. But they had outstanding shooting percentages  because they didn't force it. And neither one could jump very well  but they kept good position  and so they did well rebounding. They remembered that every shot that's taken  they assumed would be missed. I've had too many stand around and wait to see if it's missed  then they go and it's too late  somebody else is in there ahead of them. They weren't very quick  but they played good position  kept in good balance. And so they played pretty good defense for us. So they had qualities that    they came close to    as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players I ever had. So I consider them to be as successful as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton  or many of the others that we had  there were some outstanding players. Have I rambled enough  I was told that when he makes his appearance  I was supposed to shut up. When most people think about the beginnings of AIDS  they're gonna think back to the     s. And certainly  this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS and the virus that causes it  HIV. But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before  from chimpanzees  where the virus originated  into humans who hunt these apes. This photo was taken before the Great Depression in Brazzaville  Congo. At this time  there were thousands of individuals  we think  that were infected with HIV. So I have a couple of really important questions for you. If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point  why was it the case that it took us until      to be able to discover this virus  OK now  more importantly  had we been there in the '  s and '  s  '  s  had we seen this disease  had we understood exactly what was going on with it  how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved  In fact  this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of viruses come from animals. And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations. But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human. Nevertheless  we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid  trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings  that are going to be very very difficult to address    as we've seen in the case of HIV. So during the last    years  I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here    what I've labeled  viral chatter   which was a term coined by my mentor Don Burke. This is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations  the movement of these agents over into humans  and by capturing this moment  we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early. OK  so this is a picture  and I'm going to show you some pictures now from the field. This is a picture of a central African hunter. It's actually a fairly common picture. One of the things I want you to note from it is blood    that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact. This was absolutely key for us. This is a very intimate form of connection. So if we're going to study viral chatter  we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals. And so we've been studying people like this individual. We collect blood from them  other specimens. We look at the diseases  which are in the animals as well as the humans. And ideally  this is going to allow us to catch these things early on  as they're moving over into human populations. And the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals  but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis. When they were sick  we would collect specimens from them. We would actually enlist them    which we've done now    to collect specimens from animals. We give them these little pieces of filter paper. When they sample from animals  they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet unknown viruses from exactly the right animals    the ones that are actually being hunted. two hunters stalk their prey. Their names are Patrice and Patee. They're searching for bush meat  forest animals they can kill to feed their families. Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes. They have a series of traps  of snares that they've set up to catch wild pigs  snakes  monkeys  rodents    anything they can  really. Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing. The animals are simply gone. We stop for a drink of water. Then there is a rustle in the brush. A group of hunters approach  their packs loaded with wild game. There's at least three viruses that you know about  which are in this particular monkey. Nathan Wolfe  This species  yeah. And there's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals. These individuals are at specific risk  particularly if there's blood contact  they're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses. Narrator  As the hunters display their kills  something surprising happens. They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood. The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses  part of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up. NW  So this is from this animal right here  Greater Spot Nosed Guenon. Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least  at a minimum  been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities  which presumably  from our perspective  gives them the ability to decrease their own risk  and then obviously the risk to their families  the village  the country  and the world. NW  OK  before I continue  I think it's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game. OK  And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat. I'm going to be talking about this. When your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time  one of the things they're gonna ask you  is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives  some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet  to go extinct because we weren't able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world. But in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this. They're also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered into the human population  and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this  why did we let these behaviors continue  Why did we not find some other solution to this  They're going to say  in regions of profound instability throughout the world  where you have intense poverty  where populations are growing and you don't have sustainable resources like this  this is going to lead to food insecurity. But they're also going to ask you probably a different question. It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves  which is  why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here. Now this is the individual    you can see just right up over his right shoulder    this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that I showed you. OK  take a look at his shirt. You know  take a look at his face. Bush meat is one of the central crises  which is occurring in our population right now  in humanity  on this planet. But it can't be the fault of somebody like this. OK  And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone. There's no easy solutions  but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem at our own peril. So  in       along with my mentors Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi Ngole  we went to actually start this work in Central Africa  to work with hunters in this part of the world. And my job    at that time I was a post doctoral fellow  and I was really tasked with setting this up. So I said to myself   OK  great    we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these different locations. It's going to be wonderful.  You know  I looked at the map  I picked out    sites  I figured  no problem. Needless to say  I was drastically wrong. This is challenging work to do. Fortunately  I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team  and that's the only way that this work can really occur. We have a whole range of challenges about this work. One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field. The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong Minutu. He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with. When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French  and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying. Paul worked for years on the Cameroonian national radio and television  and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent. So we figured we'd hire this person    when we got there he could be a great communicator. When we would get to these rural villages  though  what we found out is that no one had television  so they wouldn't recognize his face. But    when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio. And this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message  whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention. Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from one of these very rural sites  with specimens from     individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within    hours. I like to show this shot    this is Ubald Tamoufe  who's the lead investigator in our Cameroon site. Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo because of course you can't see his face. But the reason I like to show the shot is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem. Which    which he did  which he did. Just a few quick before and after shots. This was our laboratory before. This is what it looks like now. Early on  in order to ship our specimens  we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go to the breweries    beg  borrow  steal to get these folks to give it to us. Now we have our own liquid nitrogen. I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa    it might be. And here's a shot of me  this is the before shot of me. No comment. So what happened  So during the    years that we've been doing this work  we actually surprised ourselves. We made a number of discoveries. And what we've found is that if you look in the right place  you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations. That gave us a tremendous amount of hope. What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals  including new viruses in the same group as HIV    so  brand new retroviruses. And let's face it  any new retrovirus in the human population    it's something we should be aware of. It's something we should be following. It's not something that we should be surprised by. Needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct. That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas. And critically  what happens in central Africa doesn't stay in Central Africa. So  once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring  we decided to move this from research  to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort. Through generous support and partnership scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation  we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative and begin work in four different sites in Africa and Asia. Needless to say  different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact. So it's not just hunters in Central Africa. It's also working in live animal markets    these wet markets    which is exactly the place where SARS emerged in Asia. But really  this is just the beginning from our perspective. Our objective right now  in addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving  is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably    or more sites throughout the world    to viral hotspots    because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things  ideally  before they make it to blood banks  sexual networks  airplanes. And that's really our objective. There was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us. It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves  and thought about ourselves. Many people  I think  on our planet right now despair  and they think we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things. I'm going tell you right now  please don't despair. If an intelligent extra terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet     out of    of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus  with just a few of the volumes left for plants  fungus and animals  humans being a footnote  interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless. This is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet. The dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about. And yet finally  we have the tools  which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them. Thank you very much. I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject of youth and age. I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually. The first one is dedicated to Spencer  and his grandmother  who was shocked by his work. My poem is called  Dirt.  My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap  half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar. All because of a word I said  not even said really  only repeated. But  Open   she says   open up   her hand clawing at my head. I know now her life was hard  she lost three children as babies  then her husband died too  leaving young sons  and no money. She'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet. But oh  her soap  Might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet  The street she lived on was unpaved  her flat  two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me. Dare I admit that after she did it I never really loved her again  She lived to a hundred  even then. All along it was the sadness  the squalor  but I never  until now loved her again. When that was published in a magazine I got an irate letter from my uncle.  You have maligned a great woman.  It took some diplomacy. This is called  The Dress.  It's a longer poem. In those days  those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now  when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong  then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block  and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car  having worked late again  always late  and going heavily down to the cellar  to the furnace  to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed    in those long ago days  women  my mother  my friends' mothers  our neighbors  all the women I knew    wore  often much of the day  what were called housedresses  cheap  printed  pulpy  seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and  when you had to go look for a child  hang wash on the line  or run down to the grocery store on the corner  under a coat  the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed  dangling beneath. More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event    a ball  one would think    that never came to pass  more than the way most women's faces not only were never made up during the day  but seemed scraped  bleached  and  with their plucked eyebrows  scarily masklike  more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding  adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access  and boys no conception. Only later would I see the dresses also as a proclamation  that in your dim kitchen  your laundry  your bleak concrete yard  what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation  your real sensual nature  veiled in those sexless vestments  was utterly your dominion. In those days  one hid much else as well  grown men didn't embrace one another  unless someone had died  and not always then  you shook hands or  at a ball game  thumped your friend's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection  once out of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek  not until mores at last had evolved  and you could hug another man  then hold on for a moment  then even kiss  your fathers bristles white and stiff now . What release finally  the embrace  though we were wary    it seemed so audacious    how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion  no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then. We knew so little in those days  as little as now  I suppose about healing those hurts  even the women  in their best dresses  with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices  even in lipstick and mascara  their hair aflow  could only stand wringing their hands  begging for peace  while father and son  like thugs  like thieves  like Romans  simmered and hissed and hated  inflicting sorrows that endured  the worst anyway  through the kiss and embrace  bleeding from brother to brother  into the generations. In those days there was still countryside close to the city  farms  cornfields  cows  even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests. Or you could go out by yourself even to a half block long empty lot  into the bushes  like a creature of leaves you'd lurk  crouched  crawling  simplified  savage  alone  already there was wanting to be simpler  wanting  when they called you  never to go back. This is another longish one  about the old and the young. It actually happened right at the time we met. Part of the poem takes place in space we shared and time we shared. It's called  The Neighbor.  Her five horrid  deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window. Her cats  God knows how many  who must piss on her rugs    her landing's a sickening reek. Her shadow once  fumbling the chain on her door  then the door slamming fearfully shut  only the barking and the music    jazz    filtering as it does  day and night into the hall. The time it was Chris Connor singing  Lush Life     how it brought back my college sweetheart  my first real love  who    till I left her    played the same record. And head on my shoulder  hand on my thigh  sang sweetly along  of regrets and depletions she was too young for  as I was too young  later  to believe in her pain. It startled  then bored  then repelled me. My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire trap in the Village  that my neighbor was her. My thinking we'd meet  recognize one another  become friends  that I'd accomplish a penance. My seeing her  it wasn't her  at the mailbox. Gray yellow hair  army pants under a nightgown  her turning away  hiding her ravaged face in her hands  muttering an inappropriate  Hi.  Sometimes there are frightening goings on in the stairwell. A man shouting   Shut up   The dogs frantically snarling  claws scrabbling  then her    her voice hoarse  harsh  hollow  almost only a tone  incoherent  a note  a squawk  bone on metal  metal gone molten  calling them back   Come back darlings  come back dear ones. My sweet angels  come back.  Medea she was  next time I saw her. Sorceress  tranced  ecstatic  stock still on the sidewalk ragged coat hanging agape  passersby flowing around her  her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream  silently though  as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted. A cry so pure  practiced  detached  it had no need of a voice  or could no longer bear one. These invisible links that allure  these transfigurations  even of anguish  that hold us. The girl  my old love  the last lost time I saw her when she came to find me at a party  her drunkenly stumbling  falling  sprawling  skirt hiked  eyes veined red  swollen with tears  her shame  her dishonor. My ignorant  arrogant coarseness  my secret pride  my turning away. Still life on a rooftop  dead trees in barrels  a bench broken  dogs  excrement  sky. What pathways through pain  what junctures of vulnerability  what crossings and counterings  Too many lives in our lives already  too many chances for sorrow  too many unaccounted for pasts.  Behold me   the god of frenzied  inexhaustible love says  rising in bloody splendor   Behold me.  Her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs  one agonized step at a time. My holding the door. Her crossing the fragmented tiles  faltering at the step to the street  droning  not looking at me   Can you help me   Taking my arm  leaning lightly against me. Her wavering step into the world. Her whispering   Thanks love.  Lightly  lightly against me. I think I'll lighten up a little. Another  different kind of poem of youth and age. It's called  Gas.  Wouldn't it be nice  I think  when the blue haired lady in the doctor's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts  just a little  and violently blushes. Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds  so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away. Besides  for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago  while we were on our walk  my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking. And that brought back to me the stable I worked on weekends when I was     and a splendid piebald stallion  who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that  though more hugely of course  enormous  gleaming  resplendent. And the woman  her face abashedly buried in her  Elle  now  reminded me    I'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe consisted of the fact that with every jump he took the horse would powerfully fart. Phwap  Phwap  Phwap  Something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders I devoured in those days. All that savage grandeur  the steely glinting hooves  the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards  breath stopped  heart stopped  nostrils madly flared  I didn't know if I wanted to break him  or be him. This is called  Thirst.  Many    most of my poems actually are urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't.  Thirst.  Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter  day and night  on a bench in the    rd Street subway station  until finally one day she vanished. We regarded each other  scrutinized one another. Me shyly  obliquely  trying not to be furtive. She boldly  unblinkingly  even pugnaciously  wrathfully even  when her bottle was empty. I was frightened of her. I felt like a child. I was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control  and I'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench. Not excrement merely  not merely surface and orifice going unwashed  rediffusion of rum  there was will in it  and intention  power and purpose    a social  ethical rage and rebellion    despair too  though  grief  loss. Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me  bathe her  comfort her  dress her. She wouldn't have wanted me to  I would think. Instead  I'd step into my train. How rich I would think  is the lexicon of our self absolving. How enduring  our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished. The dance of our glances  the clash  pulling each other through our perceptual punctures  then holocaust  holocaust  host on host of ill  injured presences  squandered  consumed. Her vigil somewhere I know continues. Her occupancy  her absolute  faithful attendance. The dance of our glances  challenge  abdication  effacement  the perfume of our consternation. This is a newer poem  a brand new poem. The title is  This Happened.  A student  a young woman in a fourth floor hallway of her lycee  perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes  a teacher passes and chides her   Be careful  you might fall   almost banteringly chides her   You might fall   and the young woman      a girl really  though she wouldn't think that  as brilliant as she is  first in her class  and  Beautiful  too   she's often told  smiles back  and leans into the open window  which wouldn't even be open if it were winter    if it were winter someone would have closed it   Close it       leans into the window  farther  still smiling  farther and farther  though it takes less time than this  really an instant  and lets herself fall. Herself fall. A casual impulse  a fancy  never thought of until now  hardly thought of even now ... No  more than impulse or fancy  the girl knows what she's doing  the girl means something  the girl means to mean  because it occurs to her in that instant  that beautiful or not  bright yes or no  she's not who she is  she's not the person she is  and the reason  she suddenly knows  is that there's been so much premeditation where she is  so much plotting and planning  there's hardly a person where she is  or if there is  it's not her  or not wholly her  it's a self inhabited  lived in by her  and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what's been missing  grace  not premeditation but grace  a kind of being in the world spontaneously  with grace. Weightfully upon me was the world. Weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself. Weightfully this self which weighed upon me  the release from which is what I desire and what I achieve. And the girl remembers  in this infinite instant already now so many times divided  the sadness she felt once  hardly knowing she felt it  to merely inhabit herself. Yes  the girl falls  absurd to fall  even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd  yet the girl falling isn't myself  or she is myself  but a self I took of my own volition unto myself. Forever. With grace. This happened. I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that. I like to just end. But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me. This is called  Old Man   appropriately enough.  Special  big tits   Says the advertisement for a soft core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand. But forget her breasts. A lush  fresh lipped blond  skin glowing gold  sprawls there  resplendent.    nearly  yet these hardly tangible  hardly better than harlots  can still stir me. Maybe a coming of age in the American sensual darkness  never seeing an unsmudged nipple  an uncensored vagina  has left me forever infected with an unquenchable lust of the eye. Always that erotic murmur  I'm hardly myself if I'm not in a state of incipient desire. God knows though  there are worse twists your obsessions can take. Last year in Israel  a young ultra orthodox Rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah forbade them to look in one room. Because there were images in it he said were licentious. The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked  some trying to cover their genitals  others too frightened to bother  lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch. The girls  to my horror  averted their gaze. What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them. Even that though. Another confession  Once in a book on pre war Poland  a studio portrait  an absolute angel  an absolute angel with tormented  tormenting eyes. I kept finding myself at her page. That she died in the camps made her    I didn't dare wonder why    more present  more precious. Died in the camps  that too people    or Jews anyway    kept from their children back then. But it was like sex  you didn't have to be told. Sex and death  how close they can seem. So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me  sometimes I think I confound them. My wife's loveliness almost consumes me. My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds. When we make love  her holding me everywhere all around me  I'm there and not there. My mind teems  jumbles of faces  voices  impressions  I live my life over  as though I were drowning. Then I am drowning  in despair at having to leave her  this  everything  all  unbearable  awful. Still  to be able to die with no special contrition  not having been slaughtered  or enslaved. And not having to know history's next mad rage or regression  it might be a relief. No. Again  no. I don't mean that for a moment. What I mean is the world holds me so tightly    the good and the bad    my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit Venus with her sham heat  and her bosom probably plumped with gel  so moves me my breath catches. Vamp. Siren. Seductress. How much more she reveals in her glare of ink than she knows. How she incarnates our desperate human need for regard  our passion to live in beauty  to be beauty  to be cherished by glances  if by no more  of something like love  or love. Thank you. Newspapers are dying for a few reasons. Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news  and advertisers follow them. Your iPhone  your laptop  is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday. And we should save trees in the end. So it's enough to bury any industry. So  should we rather ask   Can anything save newspapers   There are several scenarios for the future newspaper. Some people say it should be free  it should be tabloid  or even smaller  A   it should be local  run by communities  or niche  for some smaller groups like business    but then it's not free  it's very expensive. It should be opinion driven  less news  more views. And we'd rather read it during breakfast  because later we listen to radio in a car  check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV. Sounds nice  but this can only buy time. Because in the long run  I think there is no reason  no practical reason for newspapers to survive. So what can we do  Let me tell you my story.    years ago  Bonnier  Swedish publisher  started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc. After a few years  they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe. They were run by an inexperienced staff  with no visual culture  no budgets for visuals    in many places there were not even art directors. I decided to be    to work for them as an art director. Before  I was an architect  and my grandmother asked me once   What are you doing for a living   I said   I'm designing newspapers.   What  There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters  And she was right. I was very frustrated  until one day. I came to London  and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil. And I had a revelation. I thought   These guys took some creepy  run down entertainment  and put it to the highest possible level of performance art.  I thought  Oh my God  maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers.  And I did. We started to redesign them  one by one. The front page became our signature. It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers. I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation. My approach was very egotistic. I wanted my artistic statement  my interpretation of reality. I wanted to make posters  not newspapers. Not even magazines  posters. We were experimenting with type  with illustration  with photos. And we had fun. Soon it started to bring results. In Poland  our pages were named  Covers of the Year  three times in a row. Other examples you can see here are from Latvia  Lithuania  Estonia    the central European countries. But it's not only about the front page. The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece  as one composition    like music. And music has a rhythm  has ups and downs. And design is responsible for this experience. Flipping through pages is readers experience  and I'm responsible for this experience. We treated two pages  both spreads  as a one page  because that's how readers perceive it. You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards on biggest infographic competition in Spain. But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design. Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland  they name it the World's Best Designed Newspaper. And two years later  the same award came to Estonia. Isn't amazing  What really makes it amazing  that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too. Just some examples  in Russia  plus    after one year  plus    after three years of the redesign. Same in Poland  plus     up to    percent raise of circulation after three years. You can see on a graph  after years of stagnation  the paper started to grow  just after redesign. But the real hit was in Bulgaria. And that is really amazing. Did design do this  Design was just a part of the process. And the process we made was not about changing the look  it was about improving the product completely. I took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design. And I put strategy at the top of it. So first you ask a big question  why we do it  What is the goal  Then we adjust the content accordingly. And then  usually after two months  we start designing. My bosses  in the beginning  were very surprised. Why am I asking all of these business questions  instead of just showing them pages  But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer  to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end. So what is the lesson behind it  The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product. It can change your workflow    actually  it can change everything in your company  it can turn your company upside down. It can even change you. And who's responsible  Designers. Give power to designers. But the second is even more important. You can live in a small poor country  like me. You can work for a small company  in a boring branch. You can have no budgets  no people    but still can put your work to the highest possible level. And everybody can do it. You just need inspiration  vision and determination. And you need to remember that to be good is not enough. Thank you.
