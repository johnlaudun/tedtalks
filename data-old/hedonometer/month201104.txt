I wanted to be a rock star. I dreamed of it  and that's all I dreamed of. To be more accurate  I wanted to be a pop star. This was in the late '  s. And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran. They wouldn't have me. I didn't read music  but I played synthesizers and drum machines. And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada. And I was certain that's what my life would be. And when I went to college at the University of Nevada  Las Vegas when I was     I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star      or even a degree program for that interest. And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir. And I said   Yes  I would love to do that. It sounds great.  And I left the room and said   No way.  The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky  and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people. And about a week later  a friend of mine came to me and said   Listen  you've got to join choir. At the end of the semester  we're taking a trip to Mexico  all expenses paid. And the soprano section is just full of hot girls.  And so I figured for Mexico and babes  I could do just about anything. And I went to my first day in choir  and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing. They opened their scores  the conductor gave the downbeat  and boom  they launched into the Kyrie from the  Requiem  by Mozart. In my entire life I had seen in black and white  and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor. The most transformative experience I've ever had    in that single moment  hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing  people together  the shared vision. And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself. And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section  as it turns out. I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life. I had learned to read music by then  or slowly learning to read music. And that piece was published  and then I wrote another piece  and that got published. And then I started conducting  and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School. And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor. Well a couple of years ago  a friend of mine emailed me a link  a YouTube link  and said   You have got to see this.  And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me  singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called  Sleep.  My name is Britlin Losee  and this is a video that I'd like to make for you. Here's me singing  Sleep.  I'm a little nervous  just to let you know.   If there are noises     in the night   Eric Whitacre  I was thunderstruck. Britlin was so innocent and so sweet  and her voice was so pure. And I even loved seeing behind her  I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room. Such an intimate video. And I had this idea  if I could get    people to all do this same thing  sing their parts    soprano  alto  tenor and bass    wherever they were in the world  post their videos to YouTube  we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir. So I wrote on my blog   OMG OMG.  I actually wrote   OMG   hopefully for the last time in public ever. And I sent out this call to singers. And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year      called  Lux Aurumque   which means  light and gold.  And lo and behold  people started uploading their videos. Now I should say  before that  what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting. And it's in complete silence when I filmed it  because I was only hearing the music in my head  imagining the choir that would one day come to be. Afterwards  I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to. And then as the videos started to come in ... This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore. This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts. Stephen Hanson from Sweden. This is Jamal Walker from Dallas  Texas. There was even a little soprano solo in the piece  and so I had auditions. And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts. I was told later  and also by lots of singers who were involved in this  that they sometimes recorded    or    different takes until they got just the right take    they uploaded it. Here's our winner of the soprano solo. This is Melody Myers from Tennessee. I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note    like   No problem  everything's fine.  And from the crowd emerged this young man  Scott Haines. And he said   Listen  this is the project I've been looking for my whole life. I'd like to be the person to edit this all together.  I said   Thank you  Scott. I'm so glad that you found me.  And Scott aggregated all of the videos. He scrubbed the audio. He made sure that everything lined up. And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago. This is  Lux Aurumque  sung by the Virtual Choir. I'll stop it there in the interest of time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So there's more. There's more. Thank you so much. And I had the same reaction you did. I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it. I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it    these souls all on their own desert island  sending electronic messages in bottles to each other. And the video went viral. We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it. And because of that  then a lot of singers started saying   All right  what's Virtual Choir  .    And so I decided for Virtual Choir  .  that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing   Sleep   which is another work that I wrote in the year         poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri. And again  I posted a conductor video  and we started accepting submissions. This time we got some more mature members. And some younger members.   Safe in bed   EW  That's Georgie from England. She's only nine. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen  Someone did all eight videos    a bass even singing the soprano parts. This is Beau Awtin. EW  And our goal    it was sort of an arbitrary goal    there was an MTV video where they all sang  Lollipop  and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody. And there were     people involved in that. So I told the singers   That's our goal. That's the number for us to beat.  And we just closed submissions January   th  and our final tally was       videos from    different countries. Thank you. From Malta  Madagascar  Thailand  Vietnam  Jordan  Egypt  Israel  as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand. And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials  what it was like for them  their experience singing it. And I've just chosen a few of them here.  My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly. Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling. It's so wonderful to sing together again   I love the idea that she's singing with her sister.  Aside from the beautiful music  it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before  but who are connected anyway.  And my personal favorite   When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this  he told me that I did not have the voice for it.  Yeah  I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too. Me too.  It hurt so much  and I shed some tears  but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words. It is a dream come true to be part of this choir  as I've never been part of one. When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map  I had to go with the nearest city  which is about     miles away from where I live. As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush  satellite is my connection to the world.  So two things struck me deeply about this. The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other. It doesn't matter the technology. And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection. It wasn't a virtual choir. There are people now online that are friends  they've never met. But  I know myself too  I feel this virtual esprit de corps  if you will  with all of them. I feel a closeness to this choir    almost like a family. What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at  Sleep  by Virtual Choir  . . This will be a premiere today. We're not finished with the video yet. You can imagine  with       synchronized YouTube videos  the render time is just atrocious. But we do have the first three minutes. And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first. You're the very first people to see this. This is  Sleep   the Virtual Choir.   beneath the moon     A silver thread on darkened dune     With closing eyes and resting head     I know that sleep is coming soon     Upon my pillow      safe in bed      a thousand pictures fill my head     I cannot sleep     my mind's aflight     and yet my limbs seem made of lead     If there are noises in the night   Eric Whitacre  Thank you very  very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a huge believer in hands on education. But you have to have the right tools. If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics  I'm not going to give her a soldering iron. And similarly  she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands. So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of  Play Doh. And so we spent a summer looking at different Play Doh recipes. And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play dough    pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen. We have two favorite recipes    one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt. And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these. But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together. You see that really salty Play Doh  Well  it conducts electricity. And this is nothing new. It turns out that regular Play Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity  and high school physics teachers have used that for years. But our homemade play dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play Doh. And that sugar dough  Well it's     times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough. So what does that mean  Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits    circuits that the most creative  tiny  little hands can build on their own. And so I want to do a little demo for you. So if I take this salt dough  again  it's like the play dough you probably made as kids  and I plug it in    it's a two lead battery pack  simple battery pack  you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else    we can actually then light things up. But if any of you have studied electrical engineering  we can also create a short circuit. If I push these together  the light turns off. Right  the current wants to run through the play dough  not through that LED. If I separate them again  I have some light. Well now if I take that sugar dough  the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. It's like a wall to the electricity. If I place that between  now all the dough is touching  but if I stick that light back in  I have light. In fact  I could even add some movement to my sculptures. If I want a spinning tail  let's grab a motor  put some play dough on it  stick it on and we have spinning. And once you have the basics  we can make a slightly more complicated circuit. We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids. I plug in again the power to it. And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits. I can start plugging in lots of lights. And we can start talking about things like electrical load. What happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor  It'll dim. We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done. You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this. So this is all in your home kitchen. We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab. We have a website  it's all there. These are the home recipes. We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves. And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone. We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids  to a science researcher in the U.K.  and curriculum developers in Hawaii. So I would encourage you all to grab some Play Doh  grab some salt  grab some sugar and start playing. We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers  but maybe we should. Have fun. Thank you. Ten years ago  on a Tuesday morning  I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg  North Carolina. It was a routine training jump  like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper    years before. We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early. You do some routine refresher training  and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you. And you put on the T    parachute. And you're very careful how you put the straps  particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs. And then you put on your reserve  and then you put on your heavy rucksack. And then a jumpmaster comes  and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations. He checks you out  he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed  your shoulders are crushed down  and  of course  he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well. Then you sit down  and you wait a little while  because this is the Army. Then you load the aircraft  and then you stand up and you get on  and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this  in a line of people  and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft. And you wait a little bit longer  because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait. Then you take off. And it's painful enough now    and I think it's designed this way    it's painful enough so you want to jump. You didn't really want to jump  but you want out. So you get in the aircraft  you're flying along  and at    minutes out  these jumpmasters start giving you commands. They give    minutes    that's a time warning. You sit there  OK. Then they give you    minutes. And of course  you're responding with all of these. And that's to boost everybody's confidence  to show that you're not scared. Then they give you   Get ready.  Then they go   Outboard personnel  stand up.  If you're an outboard personnel  now you stand up. If you're an inboard personnel  stand up. And then you hook up  and you hook up your static line. And at that point  you think   Hey  guess what  I'm probably going to jump. There's no way to get out of this at this point.  You go through some additional checks  and then they open the door. And this was that Tuesday morning in September  and it was pretty nice outside. So nice air comes flowing in. The jumpmasters start to check the door. And then when it's time to go  a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes   Go.  The first guy goes  and you're just in line  and you just kind of lumber to the door. Jump is a misnomer  you fall. You fall outside the door  you're caught in the slipstream. The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position    head down in your chest  your arms extended  put over your reserve parachute. You do that because     years before  an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that. I have no idea whether it makes any difference  but he seemed to make sense  and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong. And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open. If you don't get an opening shock  you don't get a parachute    you've got a whole new problem set. But typically you do  typically it opens. And of course  if your leg straps aren't set right  at that point you get another little thrill. Boom. So then you look around  you're under a canopy and you say   This is good.  Now you prepare for the inevitable. You are going to hit the ground. You can't delay that much. And you really can't decide where you hit very much  because they pretend you can steer  but you're being delivered. So you look around  where you're going to land  you try to make yourself ready. And then as you get close  you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line  so that it's not on you when you land  and you prepare to do a parachute landing fall. Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance    the toes of your feet  your calves  your thighs  your buttocks and your push up muscles. It's this elegant little land  twist and roll. And that's not going to hurt. In    some years of jumping  I never did one. I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window. And as soon as I hit  the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed. I'd shake my head  and I'd ask myself the eternal question   Why didn't I go into banking   And I'd look around  and then I'd see another paratrooper  a young guy or girl  and they'd have pulled out their M  carbine and they'd be picking up their equipment. They'd be doing everything that we had taught them. And I realized that  if they had to go into combat  they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders. And I realized that  if they came out of combat  it would be because we led them well. And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did. So now I do that Tuesday morning jump  but it's not any jump    that was September   th      . And when we took off from the airfield  America was at peace. When we landed on the drop zone  everything had changed. And what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very  very real    and leadership seemed important. But things had changed  I was a    year old brigadier general. I'd been successful  but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes  and on that morning  I didn't know it. I was raised with traditional stories of leadership  Robert E. Lee  John Buford at Gettysburg. And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership. This was my father in Vietnam. And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful  they didn't lie  cheat  steal or abandon their comrades. And I still believe real leaders are like that. But in my first    years of career  I had a bunch of different experiences. One of my first battalion commanders  I worked in his battalion for    months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile    of a    mile road march  and he chewed my ass for about    seconds. And I'm not sure that was real interaction. But then a couple of years later  when I was a company commander  I went out to the National Training Center. And we did an operation  and my company did a dawn attack    you know  the classic dawn attack  you prepare all night  move to the line of departure. And I had an armored organization at that point. We move forward  and we get wiped out    I mean  wiped out immediately. The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it. And after the battle  they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an  after action review  to teach you what you've done wrong. Sort of leadership by humiliation. They put a big screen up  and they take you through everything   and then you didn't do this  and you didn't do this  etc.  I walked out feeling as low as a snake's belly in a wagon rut. And I saw my battalion commander  because I had let him down. And I went up to apologize to him  and he said   Stanley  I thought you did great.  And in one sentence  he lifted me  put me back on my feet  and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure. When      came     year old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world. First  the things that are obvious  that you're familiar with  the environment changed    the speed  the scrutiny  the sensitivity of everything now is so fast  sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it. But everything we do is in a different context. More importantly  the force that I led was spread over more than    countries. And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them  I'm now leading a force that's dispersed  and I've got to use other techniques. I've got to use video teleconferences  I've got to use chat  I've got to use email  I've got to use phone calls    I've got to use everything I can  not just for communication  but for leadership. A    year old individual operating alone  thousands of miles from me  has got to communicate to me with confidence. I have to have trust in them and vice versa. And I also have to build their faith. And that's a new kind of leadership for me. We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations. An emerging opportunity came    didn't have time to get everybody together. So we had to get complex intelligence together  we had to line up the ability to act. It was sensitive  we had to go up the chain of command  convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium. We failed. The mission didn't work. And so now what we had to do is I had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force  rebuild their confidence    me and them  and them and me  and our seniors and us as a force    all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder. Entirely new requirement. Also  the people had changed. You probably think that the force that I led was all steely eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons. In reality  much of the force I led looked exactly like you. It was men  women  young  old    not just from military  from different organizations  many of them detailed to us just from a handshake. And so instead of giving orders  you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose. Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference  the ages  had changed so much. I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan  and on that operation  a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team. We talked about the operation  and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that. I asked   Where were you on        And one young Ranger in the back    his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind    he said   Sir  I was in the sixth grade.  And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness  and yet he has different experiences  in many cases a different vocabulary  a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders. And yet  we need to have that shared sense. It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise  because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot  that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore. So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing  And it's a brand new leadership challenge. And it forced me to become a lot more transparent  a lot more willing to listen  a lot more willing to be reverse mentored from lower. And yet  again  you're not all in one room. Then another thing. There's an effect on you and on your leaders. There's an impact  it's cumulative. You don't reset  or recharge your battery every time. I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces. And I remembered his son was in our force. And I said   John  where's your son  And how is he   And he said   Sir  he's fine. Thanks for asking.  I said   Where is he now   And he pointed at the screen  he said   He's in that firefight.  Think about watching your brother  father  daughter  son  wife in a firefight in real time and you can't do anything about it. Think about knowing that over time. And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders. And you have to watch and take care of each other. I probably learned the most about relationships. I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together. I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment. And every morning in the Ranger regiment  every Ranger    and there are more than       of them    says a six stanza Ranger creed. You may know one line of it  it says   I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy.  And it's not a mindless mantra  and it's not a poem. It's a promise. Every Ranger promises every other Ranger   No matter what happens  no matter what it costs me  if you need me  I'm coming.  And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger. Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful. It's probably more powerful than marriage vows. And they've lived up to it  which gives it special power. And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing. And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever. We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in       and an old friend of mine  that I had spent many years at various points of my career with    godfather to one of their kids    he sent me a note  just in an envelope  that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said   I knew if I ever got in a tight spot  that you would come  if alive.  And having that kind of relationship  for me  turned out to be critical at many points in my career. And I learned that you have to give that in this environment  because it's tough. That was my journey. I hope it's not over. I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right  they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust. This isn't easy stuff. It's not like that electronic abs machine where     minutes a month  you get washboard abs. And it isn't always fair. You can get knocked down  and it hurts and it leaves scars. But if you're a leader  the people you've counted on will help you up. And if you're a leader  the people who count on you need you on your feet. Thank you. So what does the happiest man in the world look like  He certainly doesn't look like me. He looks like this. His name is Matthieu Ricard. So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world  Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain. And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI  versus the right prefrontal cortex. And Matthieu's happiness measure is off the charts. He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science. Which leads us to a question  What was he thinking when he was being measured  Perhaps something very naughty. Actually  he was meditating on compassion. Matthieu's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever. Reading about Matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life. My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime    and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale. And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work. Matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore. Compassion is something that creates happiness. Compassion is fun. And that mind blowing insight changes the entire game. Because if compassion was a chore  nobody's going to do it  except maybe the Dalai Lama or something. But if compassion was fun  everybody's going to do it. Therefore  to create the conditions for global compassion  all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun. But fun is not enough. What if compassion is also profitable  What if compassion is also good for business  Then  every boss  every manager in the world  will want to have compassion    like this. That would create the conditions for world peace. So  I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting. Fortunately  I didn't have to look very far. Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes    in Google  my company. I know there are other compassionate companies in the world  but Google is the place I'm familiar with because I've been there for    years  so I'll use Google as the case study. Google is a company born of idealism. It's a company that thrives on idealism. And maybe because of that  compassion is organic and widespread company wide. In Google  expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern. It's sort of a funny pattern. It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something. And they don't usually ask for permission  they just go ahead and do it  and then other Googlers join in  and it just gets bigger and bigger. And sometimes it gets big enough to become official. So in other words  it almost always starts from the bottom up. And let me give you some examples. The first example is the largest annual community event    where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities    was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official  because it just became too big. Another example  three Googlers    a chef  an engineer and  most funny  a massage therapist    three of them  they learned about a region in India where         people live without a single medical facility. So what do they do  They just go ahead and start a fundraiser. And they raise enough money to build this hospital    the first hospital of its kind for         people. During the Haiti earthquake  a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones. And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices. In China for example  one mid level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China  involving more than       schools in China  working on issues such as education  poverty  health care and the environment. There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts. And this idea  again  came from the grassroots  from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job. And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy. It was two persons saying   Let's do this   and the company said   Yes.  So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company  because Googlers found compassion to be fun. But again  fun is not enough. There are also real business benefits. So what are they  The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders. What does that mean  There are three components of compassion. There is the affective component  which is   I feel for you.  There is the cognitive component  which is   I understand you.  And there is a motivational component  which is   I want to help you.  So what has this got to do with business leadership  According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins  and documented in the book  Good to Great   it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness. And he calls them  Level   leaders.  These are leaders who  in addition to being highly capable  possess two important qualities  and they are humility and ambition. These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good. And because they're ambitious for a greater good  they feel no need to inflate their own egos. And they  according to the research  make the best business leaders. And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion  we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion    understanding people and empathizing with people    inhibits  tones down  what I call the excessive self obsession that's in us  therefore creating the conditions for humility. The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good. In other words  compassion is the way to grow Level   leaders. And this is the first compelling business benefit. The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce. Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good. It creates a vibrant  energetic community where people admire and respect each other. I mean  you come to work in the morning  and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India. It's like how can you not be inspired by those people    your own coworkers  So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration  initiative and creativity. It makes us a highly effective company. So  having said all that  what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting  In our experience  there are three ingredients. The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good. So always think  how is your company and your job serving the greater good  Or  how can you further serve the greater good  This awareness of serving the greater good is very self inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in. That's one. The second ingredient is autonomy. So in Google  there's a lot of autonomy. And one of our most popular managers jokes that  this is what he says   Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum.  And he considers himself one of the inmates. If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free  they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way. The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth. Leadership training in Google  for example  places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities  such as self awareness  self mastery  empathy and compassion  because we believe that leadership begins with character. We even created a seven week curriculum on emotion intelligence  which we jokingly call  Searching Inside Yourself.  It's less naughty than it sounds. So I'm an engineer by training  but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course  which I find kind of funny  because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence. What a company. So  Search Inside Yourself     how does it work  It works in three steps. The first step is attention training. Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. Therefore  any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training. The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time. And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence. The second step follows the first step. The second step is developing self knowledge and self mastery. So using the supercharged attention from step one  we create a high resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes. What does that mean  It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity  objectivity and from a third person perspective. And once you can do that  you create the kind of self knowledge that enables self mastery. The third step  following the second step  is to create new mental habits. What does that mean  Imagine this. Imagine whenever you meet any other person  any time you meet a person  your habitual  instinctive first thought is   I want you to be happy. I want you to be happy.  Imagine you can do that. Having this habit  this mental habit  changes everything at work. Because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people  and it creates trust  and trust creates a lot of good working relationships. And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace. Someday  we hope to open source  Search Inside Yourself  so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference. And in closing  I want to end the same place I started  with happiness. I want to quote this guy    the guy in robes  not the other guy    the Dalai Lama  who said   If you want others to be happy  practice compassion. If you want to be happy  practice compassion.  I found this to be true  both on the individual level and at a corporate level. And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too. Thank you. I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous. I went to prison    difficult. I worked in a coal mine    dangerous. I filmed in war zones    difficult and dangerous. And I spent    days eating nothing but this    fun in the beginning  little difficult in the middle  very dangerous in the end. In fact  most of my career  I've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging  that make them interesting  that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience. So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship  I knew I would want to do something a little different. So as some of you may or may not have heard  a couple weeks ago  I took out an ad on eBay. I sent out some Facebook messages  some Twitter messages  and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my      TED Talk. That's right  some lucky individual  corporation  for profit or non profit  was going to get the once in a lifetime opportunity    because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again    to buy the naming rights to the talk you're watching right now  that at the time didn't have a title  didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be. So what you were getting was this  Your name here presents  My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and  depending on the content  could ultimately blow up in your face  especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it. But that being said  it's a very good media opportunity. You know how many people watch these TED Talks  It's a lot. That's just a working title  by the way. So even with that caveat  I knew that someone would buy the naming rights. Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago  I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty. But in the new project that I'm working on  my new film  we examine the world of marketing  advertising. And as I said earlier  I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years  but nothing could prepare me  nothing could ready me  for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. You see  I had this idea for a movie. all about product placement  marketing and advertising  where the entire film is funded by product placement  marketing and advertising. So the movie will be called  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  So what happens in  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold   is that everything from top to bottom  from start to finish  is branded from beginning to end    from the above the title sponsor that you'll see in the movie  which is brand X. Now this brand  the Qualcomm Stadium  the Staples Center ... these people will be married to the film in perpetuity    forever. And so the film explores this whole idea     Michael Kassan  It's redundant.  It's what   MK  It's redundant.  In perpetuity  forever  I'm a redundant person.  MK  I'm just saying.  That was more for emphasis. It was   In perpetuity. Forever.  But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor  but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film. So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ... the greatest car you ever drove from  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold   the greatest drink you've ever had  courtesy of  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  Xavier Kochhar  So the idea is  beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life  but actually get them to finance the film   MS  Get them to finance the film.  MS  And actually we show the whole process of how does it work. The goal of this whole film is transparency. You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie. So that's the whole concept  the whole film  start to finish. And I would love for CEG to help make it happen. Robert Friedman  You know it's funny  because when I first hear it  it is the ultimate respect for an audience. Guy  I don't know how receptive people are going to be to it  though. XK  Do you have a perspective    I don't want to use  angle  because that has a negative connotation    but do you know how this is going to play out   MS  No idea.  David Cohn  How much money does it take to do this  MS   .  million.  DC  Okay.  John Kamen  I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them  but I think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big  really obvious brands. XK  Who knows  maybe by the time your film comes out  we look like a bunch of blithering idiots. MS  What do you think the response is going to be  Stuart Ruderfer  The responses mostly will be  no.  MS  But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me  JK  Both. MS  ... Meaning not so optimistic. So  sir  can you help me  I need help. MK  I can help you. MS  Okay.  MK  Good.  Awesome. MK  We've gotta figure out which brands. MS  Yeah.  MK  That's the challenge.  When you look at the people you deal with .. MK  We've got some places we can go.  MS  Okay.  Turn the camera off. MS  I thought  Turn the camera off  meant   Let's have an off the record conversation.  Turns out it really means   We want nothing to do with your movie.  MS  And just like that  one by one  all of these companies suddenly disappeared. None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. I was amazed. They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project. And I was blown away  because I thought the whole concept  the idea of advertising  was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible  to get as many people to see it as possible. Especially in today's world  this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape  isn't the idea to get that new buzz worthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses  No  that's what I thought. But the problem was  you see  my idea had one fatal flaw  and that flaw was this. Actually no  that was not the flaw whatsoever. That wouldn't have been a problem at all. This would have been fine. But what this image represents was the problem. See  when you do a Google image search for transparency  this is     This is one of the first images that comes up. So I like the way you roll  Sergey Brin. No. This is was the problem  transparency    free from pretense or deceit  easily detected or seen through  readily understood  characterized by visibility or accessibility of information  especially concerning business practices    that last line being probably the biggest problem. You see  we hear a lot about transparency these days. Our politicians say it  our president says it  even our CEO's say it. But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality  something suddenly changes. But why  Well  transparency is scary    like that odd  still screaming bear. It's unpredictable    like this odd country road. And it's also very risky. What else is risky  Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip. That's very risky. Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story  and they said   No  we want you to tell a story. We want you to tell a story  but we just want to tell our story.  See  when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie    and there he is giving me the look he often gave me    he would say   Son  there's three sides to every story. There's your story  there's my story and there's the real story.  Now you see  with this film  we wanted to tell the real story. But with only one company  one agency willing to help me    and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years    I realized that I would have to go on my own  I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team. So what you suddenly started to realize    or what I started to realize    is that when you started having conversations with these companies  the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem. and I have friends who make little independent films like I make. And the friends of mine who make big  giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have. And then my friends who make small independent films say   Well  how are we supposed to compete with these big  giant Hollywood movies   And the movie is called  The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.  So how specifically will we see Ban in the film  Any time I'm ready to go  any time I open up my medicine cabinet  you will see Ban deodorant. While anytime I do an interview with someone  I can say   Are you fresh enough for this interview  Are you ready  You look a little nervous. I want to help you calm down. So maybe you should put some one before the interview.  So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents. Whether it's a  Floral Fusion  or a  Paradise Winds   they'll have their chance. We will have them geared for both male or female    solid  roll on or stick  whatever it may be. That's the two cent tour. So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five cent tour. Karen Frank  We are a smaller brand. Much like you talked about being a smaller movie  we're very much a challenger brand. So we don't have the budgets that other brands have. So doing things like this    you know  remind people about Ban    is kind of why were interested in it. MS  What are the words that you would use to describe Ban  Ban is blank. KF  That's a great question. Woman  Superior technology. MS  Technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit. Man  We talk about bold  fresh. I think  fresh  is a great word that really spins this category into the positive  versus  fights odor and wetness.  It keeps you fresh. How do we keep you fresher longer    better freshness  more freshness  three times fresher. Things like that that are more of that positive benefit. MS  And that's a multi million dollar corporation. What about me  What about a regular guy  I need to go talk to the man on the street  the people who are like me  the regular Joes. They need to tell me about my brand. Man  Um  my brand  I don't know. I like really nice clothes. Woman    's revival meets skater punk  unless it's laundry day. MS  All right  what is brand Gerry  Gerry  Unique.  MS  Unique.  Man  I guess what kind of genre  style I am would be like dark glamor. I like a lot of black colors  a lot of grays and stuff like that. But usually I have an accessory  like sunglasses  or I like crystal and things like that too. Woman  If Dan were a brand  he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz. Man    The brand that I am is  I would call it casual fly. Woman    Part hippie  part yogi  part Brooklyn girl    I don't know. Man    I'm the pet guy. I sell pet toys all over the country  all over the world. So I guess that's my brand. In my warped little industry  that's my brand. Man    My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods. Man    Failed writer alcoholic brand. Is that something  Lawyer  I'm a lawyer brand. Tom  I'm Tom. MS  Well we can't all be brand Tom  but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly. And what I realized is I needed an expert. I needed somebody who could get inside my head  somebody who could really help me understand what they call your  brand personality.  And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg. They've helped companies like Nestle  Febreze  Hallmark discover that brand personality. If they could do it for them  surely they could do it for me. MS  I did. The very first picture is a picture of my family. A  So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are. MS  These are the people who shape the way I look at the world. A  Tell me about this world. MS  This world  I think your world is the world that you live in    like people who are around you  your friends  your family  the way you live your life  the job you do. All those things stemmed and started from one place  and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia. A  What's the next one you want to talk about  MS  The next one  This was the best day ever. A  How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are  MS  It's like  who do I want to be  I like things that are different. I like things that are weird. I like weird things. A  Tell me about the  why  phase    what does that do for us  What is the machete  What pupa stage are you in now  Why is it important to reboot  What does the red represent  Tell me a little bit about that part. ... A little more about you that is not who you are. What are some other metamorphoses that you've had  ... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on  MS  EEEEEE   A  Thank you.  No  thank you. A  Thanks for you patience.  MS  Great job.  A  Yeah.  MS  Thanks a lot.  All right. MS  Yeah  I don't know what's going to come of this. There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there. Lindsay Zaltman  The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct  but complementary sides to your brand personality    the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful play brand. Those are juxtaposed very nicely together. And I think there's almost a paradox with those. And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both. Most companies tend to    and it's human nature    to avoid things that they're not sure of  avoid fear  those elements  and you really embrace those  and you actually turn them into positives for you  and it's a neat thing to see. What other brands are like that  The first on here is the classic  Apple. And you can see here too  Target  Wii  Mini from the Mini Coopers  and JetBlue. Now there's playful brands and mindful brands  those things that have come and gone  but a playful  mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing. MS  A playful  mindful brand. What is your brand  If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity  your brand personality  what would you be  Are you an up attribute  Are you something that gets the blood flowing  Or are you more of a down attribute  Are you something that's a little more calm  reserved  conservative  Up attributes are things like being playful  being fresh like the Fresh Prince  contemporary  adventurous  edgy or daring like Errol Flynn  nimble or agile  profane  domineering  magical or mystical like Gandalf. Or are you more of a down attribute  Are you mindful  sophisticated like      Are you established  traditional  nurturing  protective  empathetic like the Oprah  Are you reliable  stable  familiar  safe  secure  sacred  contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda  Over the course of this film  we had     plus companies who were up and down companies saying   no   they didn't want any part of this project. They wanted nothing to do with this film  mainly because they would have no control  they would have no control over the final product. But we did get    brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control  who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell    stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind. They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing  as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRI's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing. We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising. In the entire city for the past five years  there's no billboards  there's no posters  there's no flyers  nothing. And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash strapped schools all across America. What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of  or I've had the most success in  are ones where I've interacted with things directly. And that's what these brands did. They cut out the middleman  they cut out their agencies and said   Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind. I'm going to deal directly with the artist. I'm going to work with him to create something different  something that's going to get people thinking  that's going to challenge the way we look at the world.  And how has that been for them  Has it been successful  Well  since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival  let's take a look. According to Burrelles  the movie premiered in January  and since then    and this isn't even the whole thing    we've had     million media impressions for this film. That's literally covering just like a two and a half week period. That's only online    no print  no TV. The film hasn't even been distributed yet. It's not even online. It's not even streaming. It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet. So ultimately  this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum. And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part. What I always believe is that if you take chances  if you take risks  that in those risks will come opportunity. I believe that when you push people away from that  you're pushing them more towards failure. I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse  then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged. I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks. We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them. Ultimately  moving forward  I think we have to embrace fear. We've got to put that bear in a cage. Embrace fear. Embrace risk. One big spoonful at a time  we have to embrace risk. And ultimately  we have to embrace transparency. Today  more than ever  a little honesty is going to go a long way. And that being said  through honesty and transparency  my entire talk   Embrace Transparency   has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC  who for        bought the naming rights on eBay. EMC  Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world. EMC presents   Embrace Transparency.  Thank you very much  guys. June Cohen  So  Morgan  in the name of transparency  what exactly happened to that         MS  That is a fantastic question. I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization  the Sapling Foundation    a check for        to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED. I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects. But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy. This guy's name is TEMPT. TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the   s. And he came up home from a run one day and said   Dad  my legs are tingling.  And that was the onset of ALS. So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. He only has use of his eyes. I was exposed to him. I have a company that does design and animation  so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world. And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony  TEMPT  and his cause. So I went and met with his brother and father and said   We're going to give you this money. What are you going to do with it   And his brother said   I just want to be able to talk to Tony again. I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me.  And I said   Wait a second  isn't that    I've seen Stephen Hawking    don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices   And he said   No  unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance  you can't actually do that. These devices aren't accessible to people.  And I said   Well  how do you actually communicate   Has everyone seen the movie  The Diving Bell and the Butterfly   That's how they communicate    so run their finger along. I said   That's archaic. How can that be   So I showed up with the desire to just write a check  and instead  I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash. I committed to his brother and his father right then and there    I'm like   All right  here's the deal  Tony's going to speak  we're going to get him a machine  and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again. Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it.  So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that. I met these guys called GRL  Graffiti Research Lab  and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then  with a laser pointer  draw on it  and it just registers the negative space. So they go around and do art installations like this. All the things that go up there  they said there's a life cycle. First it starts with the sexual organs  then it starts with cuss words  then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art. But there was always a life cycle to their presentations. So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this  and we were like   Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things  why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again  Well that would be awesome.  So that started the journey. And about two years later  about a year later  after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around  we'd accomplished a couple things. One  we battered down the doors of the insurance companies  and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate    a Stephen Hawking machine. Which was awesome. And he's seriously one of the funniest    I call him Yoda  because you talk to the guy  you get an email from him  and you're like   I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing.  The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world    literally every corner of the world    into our house. My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage  and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house. A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls. But for over two weeks  we programmed  we went to the Venice boardwalk  my kids got involved  my dog got involved  and we created this. This is called the EyeWriter  and you can see the description. This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk  some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack. We took a PS  camera  hacked it open  mounted it to an LED light  and now there's a device that is free    you build this yourself  we publish the code for free  you download the software for free. And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitations. There's no insurance company that can say  No.  There's no hospital that can say  No.  Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes. Thank you. Thank you guys very much. That was awesome. So at the end of the two weeks  we went back to TEMPT's room. I love this picture  because this is someone else's room and that's his room. So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling. And after over a year of planning  two weeks of programming  carb fest and all night sessions  Tony drew again for the first time in seven years. And this is an amazing picture  because this is his life support system  and he's looking over his life support system. We kicked his bed so that he could see out. And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital. And he drew again for the first time  in front of his family and friends    and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was. The funny thing was  we had to break into the parking lot too  so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too. So at the end of this  he sent us an email  and this is what the email said   That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years. I feel like I had been held underwater  and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe.  Isn't that awesome  So that's kind of our battle cry. That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing. And we've got such a long way to go with this. This is an amazing device  but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch. And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more. So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better  faster  stronger. Since that time  we've had all kinds of acknowledgment. We've won a bunch of awards. Remember  it's free  none of us are making any money on this thing. It's all coming out of our own pockets. So the awards were like   Oh  this is fantastic.  Armstrong Twittered about us  and then in December  Time magazine honored us as one of the top    inventions of       which was really cool. The coolest thing about this    and this is what's completing the whole circle    is that in April of this year  at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles  there's going to be an exhibition called  Art of the Streets.  And  Art of the Streets  is going to have pretty much the bad asses of the street art scene    Banksy  Shepard Fairey  KAWS    all of these guys will be there. TEMPT's going to be in the show  which is pretty awesome. So basically this is my point  If you see something that's not possible  make it possible. Everything in this room wasn't possible    this stage  this computer  this mic  the EyeWriter    wasn't possible at one point. Make it possible  everyone in this room. I'm not a programmer  never done anything with ocular recognition technology  but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen. And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done  if not now  then when  And if not me  then who  Thank you guys. Can any of you remember what you wanted to be when you were     Do you know what I wanted to be  I wanted to be a biker chick. I wanted to race cars  and I wanted to be a cowgirl  and I wanted to be Mowgli from  The Jungle Book.  Because they were all about being free  the wind in your hair    just to be free. And on my seventeenth birthday  my parents  knowing how much I loved speed  gave me one driving lesson for my seventeenth birthday. Not that we could have afforded I drive  but to give me the dream of driving. And on my seventeenth birthday  I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence  as I always had all my life    my visually impaired sister    to go to see an eye specialist. Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters. And my little sister wanted to be a pilot    God help her. So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun. And on my seventeenth birthday  after my fake eye exam  the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday. And he said   So what are you going to do to celebrate   And I took that driving lesson  and I said   I'm going to learn how to drive.  And then there was a silence    one of those awful silences when you know something's wrong. And he turned to my mother  and he said   You haven't told her yet   On my seventeenth birthday  as Janis Ian would best say  I learned the truth at   . I am  and have been since birth  legally blind. And you know  how on earth did I get to    and not know that  Well  if anybody says country music isn't powerful  let me tell you this  I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song   A Boy Named Sue.  I'm the eldest of three. I was born in     . And very shortly after my birth  my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism. And what the hell does that mean to you  So let me just tell you  the great part of all of this  I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing  so holy God  woohoo   Laughter  I might buy some more time. But more importantly  let me tell you    I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out  Pat. Hey. See this hand  Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline. Every man in this room  even you  Steve  is George Clooney. And every woman  you are so beautiful. And when I want to look beautiful  I step three feet away from the mirror  and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting I've done all my life from all the dark lights. The really strange part is that  at three and a half  just before I was going to school  my parents made a bizarre  unusual and incredibly brave decision. No special needs schools. No labels. No limitations. My ability and my potential. And they decided to tell me that I could see. So just like Johnny Cash's Sue  a boy given a girl's name  I would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive  when they were no longer there to protect me  or just take it all away. But more significantly  they gave me the ability to believe  totally  to believe that I could. And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things  a big fat  no   everybody imagines I was devastated. And don't get me wrong  because when I first heard it    aside from the fact that I thought he was insane    I got that thump in my chest  just that  huh   But very quickly I recovered. It was like that. The first thing I thought about was my mom  who was crying over beside me. And I swear to God  I walked out of his office   I will drive. I will drive. You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive.  And with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child    he taught me how to sail  knowing I could never see where I was going  I could never see the shore  and I couldn't see the sails  and I couldn't see the destination. But he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face. And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive. And for the next    years  I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see  because I didn't want to be a failure  and I didn't want to be weak. And I believed I could do it. So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do. And I was an archeologist  and then I broke things. And then I managed a restaurant  and then I slipped on things. And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener. And then I went to business school. And you know  disabled people are hugely educated. And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture. And they didn't even know. And it's extraordinary how far belief can take you. In       two and a half years into that job  something happened. Wonderfully  my eyes decided  enough. And temporarily  very unexpectedly  they dropped. And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world  where you work hard  play hard  you gotta be the best  you gotta be the best. And two years in  I really could see very little. And I found myself in front of an HR manager in       saying something I never imagined that I would say. I was    years old. I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do. And I simply said   I'm sorry. I can't see  and I need help.  Asking for help can be incredibly difficult. And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that. We all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure. And it's frightening  isn't it  But all that belief had fueled me so long. And can I tell you  operating in the sighted world when you can't see  it's kind of difficult    it really is. Can I tell you  airports are a disaster. Oh  for the love of God. And please  any designers out there  OK  designers  please put up your hands  even though I can't even see you. I always end up in the gents' toilets. And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell. But can I just tell you  the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle. Have you ever tried to see that if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes  It's such a small thing  right  And you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you're not  or to be somebody that you aren't  And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR  they sent me off to an eye specialist. And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life. But before I got to him  I was so lost. I had no idea who I was anymore. And that eye specialist  he didn't bother testing my eyes. God no  it was therapy. And he asked me several questions  of which many were   Why  Why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself  And do you love what you do  Caroline   And you know  when you go to a global consulting firm  they put a chip in your head  and you're like   I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.   Laughter  To leave would be failure. And he said   Do you love it   I couldn't even speak I was so choked up. I just was so    how do I tell him  And then he said to me   What did you want to be when you were little   Now listen  I wasn't going to say to him   Well  I wanted to race cars and motorbikes.  Hardly appropriate at this moment in time. He thought I was mad enough anyway. And as I left his office  he called me back and he said   I think it's time. I think it's time to stop fighting and do something different.  And that door closed. And that silence just outside a doctor's office  that many of us know. And my chest ached. And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea. But I did know the game was up. And I went home  and  because the pain in my chest ached so much  I thought   I'll go out for a run.  Really not a very sensible thing to do. And I went on a run that I know so well. I know this run so well  by the back of my hand. I always run it perfectly fine. I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with. And there was a rock that I always missed. And I'd never fallen on it  never. And there I was crying away  and smash  bash on my rock. Broken  fallen over on this rock in the middle of March in       typical Irish weather on a Wednesday    gray  snot  tears everywhere  ridiculously self pitying. And I was floored  and I was broken  and I was angry. And I didn't know what to do. And I sat there for quite some time going   How am I going to get off this rock and go home  Because who am I going to be  What am I going to be   And I thought about my dad  and I thought   Good God  I'm so not Sue now.  And I kept thinking over and over in my mind  what had happened  Where did it go wrong  Why didn't I understand  And you know  the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers. I had lost my belief. Look where my belief had brought me to. And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see. I was crumpled. And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me   What do you want to be  What do you want to be  What did you want to be when you were little  Do you love what you do  Do something different. What do you want to be  Do something different. What do you want to be   And really slowly  slowly  slowly  it happened. And it did happen this way. And then the minute it came  it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart    something different.  Well  how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'  You don't get more different than that.  And the moment  and I mean the moment  the moment that hit me  I swear to God  it was like woo hoo  You know    something to believe in. And nobody can tell me no. Yes  you can say I can't be an archeologist. But you can't tell me  no  I can't be Mowgli  because guess what  Nobody's ever done it before  so I'm going to go do it. And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl  I'm just going to scoot. And so I got off that rock  and  oh my God  did I run home. And I sprinted home  and I didn't fall  and I didn't crash. And I ran up the stairs  and there was one of my favorite books of all time   Travels on My Elephant  by Mark Shand    I don't know if any of you know it. And I grabbed this book off  and I'm sitting on the couch going   I know what I'm going to do. I know how to be Mowgli. I'm going to go across India on the back of an elephant. I'm going to be an elephant handler.  And I had no idea how I was going to be an elephant handler. From global management consultant to elephant handler. I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant  get an elephant. I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue. But I knew I would. Because  when you make a decision at the right time and the right place  God  that universe makes it happen for you. Nine months later  after that day on snot rock  I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi. And together we would trek a thousand kilometers across India. The most powerful thing of all  it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God  I did. But you know  I was believing in the wrong thing. Because I wasn't believing in me  really me  all the bits of me    all the bits of all of us. Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not  And you know what  when you really believe in yourself and everything about you  it's extraordinary what happens. And you know what  that trip  that thousand kilometers  it raised enough money for       cataract eye operations. Six thousand people got to see because of that. When I came home off that elephant  do you know what the most amazing part was  I chucked in my job at Accenture. I left  and I became a social entrepreneur  and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family  which deals with Asian elephant conservation. And I set up Kanchi  because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant  because disability is like the elephant in the room. And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way    no charity  no pity. But I wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible. It was extraordinary. That's what I wanted to do. And I never thought about noes anymore  or not seeing  or any of that kind of nothing. It just seemed that it was possible. And you know  the oddest part is  when I was on my way traveling here to TED  I'll be honest  I was petrified. And I speak  but this is an amazing audience  and what am I doing here  But as I was traveling here  you'll be very happy to know  I did use my white symbol stick cane  because it's really good to skip queues in the airport. And I got my way here being happily proud that I couldn't see. And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine  he texted me on the way over  knowing I was scared. Even though I present confident  I was scared. He said   Be you.  And so here I am. This is me  all of me. And I have learned  you know what  cars and motorbikes and elephants  that's not freedom. Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom. And I never needed eyes to see    never. I simply needed vision and belief. And if you truly believe    and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart    you can make change happen. And we need to make it happen  because every single one of us    woman  man  gay  straight  disabled  perfect  normal  whatever    everyone of us must be the very best of ourselves. I no longer want anybody to be invisible. We all have to be included. And stop with the labels  the limiting. Losing of labels  because we are not jam jars. We are extraordinary  different  wonderful people. Thank you. First  a video. Yes  it is a scrambled egg. But as you look at it  I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy. Because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself. And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated. And now they're going to be poured back into the egg. And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works. A scrambled egg is mush    tasty mush    but it's mush. An egg is a beautiful  sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things  such as chickens. And we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity. In fact  this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics  the second law of thermodynamics  or the law of entropy. What that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order  lack of structure    in fact  to mush. And that's why that video feels a bit strange. And yet  look around us. What we see around us is staggering complexity. Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone  there are some    billion SKUs  or distinct commodities  being traded. That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth. And they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals  who are linked by trade  travel  and the Internet into a global system of stupendous complexity. So here's a great puzzle  in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics  how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described  the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center  Well  the answer seems to be  the universe can create complexity  but with great difficulty. In pockets  there appear what my colleague  Fred Spier  calls  Goldilocks conditions     not too hot  not too cold  just right for the creation of complexity. And slightly more complex things appear. And where you have slightly more complex things  you can get slightly more complex things. And in this way  complexity builds stage by stage. Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe. We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments. And at each threshold  the going gets tougher. The complex things get more fragile  more vulnerable  the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent  and it's more difficult to create complexity. Now  we  as extremely complex creatures  desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law  and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility. And that's the story that we tell in big history. But to do it  you have do something that may  at first sight  seem completely impossible. You have to survey the whole history of the universe. So let's do it. Let's begin by winding the timeline back   .  billion years  to the beginning of time. Around us  there's nothing. There's not even time or space. Imagine the darkest  emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are. And then suddenly  bang  A universe appears  an entire universe. And we've crossed our first threshold. The universe is tiny  it's smaller than an atom. It's incredibly hot. It contains everything that's in today's universe  so you can imagine  it's busting. And it's expanding at incredible speed. And at first  it's just a blur  but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur. Within the first second  energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity. And energy does something else quite magical  it congeals to form matter    quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons. And all of that happens in the first second. Now we move forward         years. That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet. And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium. Now I want to pause for a moment          years after the origins of the universe  because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage. We know above all that it was extremely simple. It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms  and they have no structure. They're really a sort of cosmic mush. But that's not completely true. Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that  in fact  there are just tiny differences in that background. What you see here  the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas. These are tiny differences  but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity. And this is how it works. Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff. So where you get slightly denser areas  gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms. So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds. And each cloud is compacted  gravity gets more powerful as density increases  the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud  and then  at the center  the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of    million degrees  protons start to fuse  there's a huge release of energy  and    bam  We have our first stars. From about     million years after the Big Bang  stars begin to appear all through the universe  billions of them. And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex. Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds. When very large stars die  they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations  to form all the elements of the periodic table. If  like me  you're wearing a gold ring  it was forged in a supernova explosion. So now the universe is chemically more complex. And in a chemically more complex universe  it's possible to make more things. And what starts happening is that  around young suns  young stars  all these elements combine  they swirl around  the energy of the star stirs them around  they form particles  they form snowflakes  they form little dust motes  they form rocks  they form asteroids  and eventually  they form planets and moons. And that is how our solar system was formed  four and a half billion years ago. Rocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials. So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity. Now  the going gets tougher. The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile  significantly more vulnerable  but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity. I'm talking  of course  about living organisms. Living organisms are created by chemistry. We are huge packages of chemicals. So  chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force. That operates over smaller scales than gravity  which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets. Now  what are the ideal conditions for chemistry  What are the Goldilocks conditions  Well  first  you need energy  but not too much. In the center of a star  there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again. But not too little. In intergalactic space  there's so little energy that atoms can't combine. What you want is just the right amount  and planets  it turns out  are just right  because they're close to stars  but not too close. You also need a great diversity of chemical elements  and you need liquids  such as water. Why  Well  in gases  atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up. In solids  atoms are stuck together  they can't move. In liquids  they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules. Now  where do you find such Goldilocks conditions  Well  planets are great  and our early Earth was almost perfect. It was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water. And deep beneath those oceans  at cracks in the Earth's crust  you've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth  and you've got a great diversity of elements. So at those deep oceanic vents  fantastic chemistry began to happen  and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations. But of course  life is more than just exotic chemistry. How do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable  Well  it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick. You don't stabilize the individual  you stabilize the template  the thing that carries information  and you allow the template to copy itself. And DNA  of course  is the beautiful molecule that contains that information. You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA. Each rung contains information. So  DNA contains information about how to make living organisms. And DNA also copies itself. So  it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean. So the information spreads. Notice that information has become part of our story. The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections. As it copies itself  once in every billion rungs  there tends to be an error. And what that means is that DNA is  in effect  learning. It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work. So DNA's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity. And we can see this happening over the last four billion years. For most of that time of life on Earth  living organisms have been relatively simple    single cells. But they had great diversity  and  inside  great complexity. Then from about     to     million years ago  multi celled organisms appear. You get fungi  you get fish  you get plants  you get amphibia  you get reptiles  and then  of course  you get the dinosaurs. And occasionally  there are disasters. Sixty five million years ago  an asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula  creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war  and the dinosaurs were wiped out. Terrible news for the dinosaurs  but great news for our mammalian ancestors  who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs. And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began    million years ago with the landing of an asteroid. Humans appeared about         years ago. And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story. Let me explain why. We've seen that DNA learns in a sense  it accumulates information. But it is so slow. DNA accumulates information through random errors  some of which just happen to work. But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning  it had produced organisms with brains  and those organisms can learn in real time. They accumulate information  they learn. The sad thing is  when they die  the information dies with them. Now what makes humans different is human language. We are blessed with a language  a system of communication  so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory. And that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information  and it can accumulate from generation to generation. And that's why  as a species  we're so creative and so powerful  and that's why we have a history. We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift. I call this ability collective learning. It's what makes us different. We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history. We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa  but then you see humans migrating into new environments  into desert lands  into jungles  into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia    tough  tough environment    into the Americas  into Australasia. Each migration involved learning    learning new ways of exploiting the environment  new ways of dealing with their surroundings. Then        years ago  exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age  humans learned to farm. Farming was an energy bonanza. And exploiting that energy  human populations multiplied. Human societies got larger  denser  more interconnected. And then from about     years ago  humans began to link up globally through shipping  through trains  through telegraph  through the Internet  until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals. And that brain is learning at warp speed. And in the last     years  something else has happened. We've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels. So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us. So    Here we are  back at the convention center. We've been on a journey  a return journey  of   .  billion years. I hope you agree this is a powerful story. And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role. But it also contains warnings. Collective learning is a very  very powerful force  and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it. I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England  living through the Cuban Missile Crisis. For a few days  the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction. And the same weapons are still here  and they are still armed. If we avoid that trap  others are waiting for us. We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last        years. So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us  but it can also show us our power with collective learning. And now  finally    this is what I want. I want my grandson  Daniel  and his friends and his generation  throughout the world  to know the story of big history  and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us. And that's why a group of us are building a free  online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world. We believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them  as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet. I thank you for your attention. How often do we hear that people just don't care  How many times have you been told that real  substantial change isn't possible because most people are too selfish  too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community  I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn't actually exist  but rather  that people do care  but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way. And I'll give you some examples of what I mean. Let's start with city hall. You ever see one of these before  This is a newspaper ad. It's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what's happening. As you can see  it's impossible to read. You need to get halfway down to even find out which address they're talking about  and then farther down  in tiny    point font  to find out how to actually get involved. Imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way    if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes and put an ad in the paper like that. Now that would never happen. You'll never see an ad like that because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes. Whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved with the planning process  otherwise their ads would look something like this    with all the information basically laid out clearly. As long as the city's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged  then of course people aren't going to be engaged. But that's not apathy  that's intentional exclusion. Public space. The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change because we've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression. Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice  dominating the visual and mental environment. The problem with this model is that there are some amazing messages that need to be said that aren't profitable to say. So you're never going to see them on a billboard. The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change  mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals  but even when they do talk about important political issues  they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement. And I'll give you an example  the Now magazine from last week    progressive  downtown weekly in Toronto. This is the cover story. It's an article about a theater performance  and it starts with basic information about where it is  in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article    where  the time  the website. Same with this    it's a movie review  an art review  a book review    where the reading is in case you want to go. A restaurant    you might not want to just read about it  maybe you want to go to the restaurant. So they tell you where it is  what the prices are  the address  the phone number  etc. Then you get to their political articles. Here's a great article about an important election race that's happening. It talks about the candidates    written very well    but no information  no follow up  no websites for the campaigns  no information about when the debates are  where the campaign offices are. Here's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign. The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat  maybe read a book  maybe see a movie  but not be engaged in their community. And you might think this is a small thing  but I think it's important because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport. Heroes  How do we view leadership  Look at these    movies. What do they have in common  Anyone  They all have heroes who were chosen. Someone came up to them and said   You're the chosen one. There's a prophesy. You have to save the world.  And then someone goes off and saves the world because they've been told to  with a few people tagging along. This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about. A heroic effort is a collective effort  number one. Number two  it's imperfect  it's not very glamorous  and it doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end. It's an ongoing process your whole life. But most importantly  it's voluntary. It's voluntary. As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead  or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy  they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership  which is that it comes from within. It's about following your own dreams    uninvited  uninvited    and then working with others to make those dreams come true. Political parties  oh boy. Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics. Instead  they've become  sadly  uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing  pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas. And people can smell that  and it feeds cynicism. Charitable status  Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy. This is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced  especially during election time. Which leads us to the last one  which is our elections. As you may have noticed  our elections in Canada are a complete joke. We use out of date systems that are unfair and create random results. Canada's currently led by a party that most Canadians didn't actually want. How can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don't count in Canada  You add all this up together and of course people are apathetic. It's like trying to run into a brick wall. Now I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what's in our way. Quite the opposite  I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care. But that  as I said  we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way. As long as we believe that people  our own neighbors  are selfish  stupid or lazy  then there's no hope. But we can change all those things I mentioned. We can open up city hall. We can reform our electoral systems. We can democratize our public spaces. My main message is  if we can redefine apathy  not as some kind of internal syndrome  but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement  and if we can clearly define  we can clearly identify  what those obstacles are  and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles  then anything is possible. Thank you. Roger Ebert  These are my words  but this is not my voice. This is Alex  the best computer voice I've been able to find  which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh. For most of my life  I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak. It was like breathing. In those days  I was living in a fool's paradise. After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak  eat or drink  I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me. For several days now  we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED. I used to be able to talk like that. Maybe I wasn't as smart  but I was at least as talkative. I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself  and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away. However  I've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous. So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me. I will start with my wife  Chaz. Chaz Ebert  It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak. Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in       I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show  'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.' I had pre taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation. The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw. My tongue  larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected. CE  I was optimistic  and all was right with the world. The first surgery was a great success. I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good. Two weeks later  I was ready to return home. I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song 'I'm Your Man' for my doctors and nurses. Suddenly  I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding. My carotid artery had ruptured. Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there. Chaz told me that if that song hadn't played for so long  I might have already been in the car  on the way home  and would have died right there and then. So thank you  Leonard Cohen  for saving my life. There was a second surgery    which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart. And then a third attempt  which also patched me back together pretty well  until it failed. A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture. And before I left the hospital  after a year of being hospitalized  I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery. There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again  it just sort of became obvious. Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system. We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds. Therefore  the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air. Because I had lost my jaw  I could no longer form a seal  and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless. Dean Ornish  At first for a long time  I wrote messages in notebooks. Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice. This was faster  and nobody had to try to read my handwriting. I tried out various computer voices that were available online  and for several months I had a British accent  which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.   It was the clearest I could find. Then Apple released the Alex voice  which was the best I'd heard. It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark. When it saw a period  it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air. There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices  and I've experimented with them. For me  they share a fundamental problem  they're too slow. When I find myself in a conversational situation  I need to type fast and to jump right in. People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase. But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice  How does that affect who you are as a person  When people hear Alex speaking my words  do they experience a disconnect  Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next  How did I feel not being able to speak  I felt  and I still feel  a lot of distance from the human mainstream. I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop. Even then  I'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties. So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of    years. At first I was against it. I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer. There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own. But I decided then to just give it a try. So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices. They'd never made one from previously recorded materials. All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth. But they were willing to give it a try. So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice  including several audio commentary tracks that I'd made for movies on DVDs. And it sounded like me  it really did. There was a reason for that  it was me. But it wasn't that simple. The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved    movie soundtracks  for example  or Gene Siskel arguing with me    and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn't fit into a sentence well enough. I'll let you hear a sample of that voice. These are a few of the comments I recorded for use when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program. And here's the voice we call Roger Jr. or Roger  . . Roger  .   Oprah  I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show. We have been talking for a long time  and now here we are again. This is the first version of my computer voice. It still needs improvement  but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL     . When I heard it the first time  it sent chills down my spine. When I type anything  this voice will speak whatever I type. When I read something  it will read in my voice. I have typed these words in advance  as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing. The voice was created by a company in Scotland named CereProc. It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on  Casablanca  and  Citizen Kane.  This is the first voice they've created for an individual. There are several very good voices available for computers  but they all sound like somebody else  while this voice sounds like me. I plan to use it on television  radio and the Internet. People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built in speaking systems. Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves. But I've got to say  in first grade  they said I talked too much  and now I still can. Roger Ebert  As you can hear  it sounds like me  but the words jump up and down. The flow isn't natural. The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice  and I'm optimistic about it. But so far  the Apple Alex voice is the best one I've heard. I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex. He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice. A very large sample is needed. John Hunter  All my life I was a motormouth. Now I have spoken my last words  and I don't even remember for sure what they were. I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled  I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.  On Wednesday  David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time span of the universe. For almost all of its millions and billions of years  there was no life on Earth at all. For almost all the years of life on Earth  there was no intelligent life. Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next  did civilization become possible. In cosmological terms  that was about    minutes ago. Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool  the computer. That has mostly happened in my lifetime. Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana  the birthplace of HAL     . When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday  about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world  I had a flashback. It was about     . As a local newspaper reporter still in high school  I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO. The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations. This was a computer assisted instruction system  which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC. The programmers said it could assist students in their learning. I doubt  on that day    years ago  they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished. But that's not the point. The point is PLATO was only    years ago  an instant in time. It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers  until only five years ago. I have learned from Wikipedia that  starting with that humble beginning  PLATO established forums  message boards  online testing  email  chat rooms  picture languages  instant messaging  remote screen sharing and multiple player games. Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana  it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual  online universe we occupy today. But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce. I'm here as a man who wants to communicate. All of this has happened in my lifetime. I started writing on a computer back in the     s when one of the first Atech systems was installed at the Chicago Sun Times. I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model    's. And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections  they didn't know what I was talking about. When I bought my first desktop  it was a DEC Rainbow. Does anybody remember that    The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble. I joined CompuServe when it had fewer numbers than I currently have followers on Twitter. CE  All of this has happened in the blink of an eye. It is unimaginable what will happen next. It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history. Indeed  I am lucky to live in history at all  because without intelligence and memory there is no history. For billions of years  the universe evolved completely without notice. Now we live in the age of the Internet  which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness. And because of it  I can communicate as well as I ever could. We are born into a box of time and space. We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others. For me  the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence. I cannot speak  I can only type so fast. Computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated  but with my computer  I can communicate more widely than ever before. I feel as if my blog  my email  Twitter and Facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation. They aren't an improvement  but they're the best I can do. They give me a way to speak. Not everybody has the patience of my wife  Chaz. But online  everybody speaks at the same speed. This whole adventure has been a learning experience. Every time there was a surgery that failed  I was left with a little less flesh and bone. Now I have no jaw left at all. While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders  the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily. Ironic that my legs are fine  and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk. When you see me today  I look like the Phantom of the Opera. But no you don't. It is human nature to look at someone like me and assume I have lost some of my marbles. People    People talk loudly    I'm so sorry. Excuse me. People talk loudly and slowly to me. Sometimes they assume I am deaf. There are people who don't want to make eye contact. Believe me  he didn't mean this as    anyway  let me just read it. You should never let your wife read something like this. It is human nature to look away from illness. We don't enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality. That's why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me. My ability to think and write have not been affected. And on the Web  my real voice finds expression. I have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way. One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes. One of the funniest blogs on the Web is written by a friend of mine named Smartass Cripple. Google him and he will make you laugh. All of these people are saying  in one way or another  that what you see is not all you get. So I have not come here to complain. I have much to make me happy and relieved. I seem  for the time being  to be cancer free. I am writing as well as ever. I am productive. If I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago  I would be as isolated as a hermit. I would be trapped inside my head. Because of the rush of human knowledge  because of the digital revolution  I have a voice  and I do not need to scream. RE  Wait. I have one more thing to add. A guy goes into a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist says   You're crazy.  The guy says   I want a second opinion.  The psychiatrist says   All right  you're ugly.  You all know the test for artificial intelligence    the Turing test. A human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer. If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human  the machine has passed the test. I now propose a test for computer voices    the Ebert test. If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman  then that's the voice I want. Hi  my name is Marcin    farmer  technologist. I was born in Poland  now in the U.S. I started a group called Open Source Ecology. We've identified the    most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist    things from tractors  bread ovens  circuit makers. Then we set out to create an open source  DIY  do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. We call this the Global Village Construction Set. So let me tell you a story. So I finished my   s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy  and I discovered I was useless. I had no practical skills. The world presented me with options  and I took them. I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle. So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming. I bought a tractor    then it broke. I paid to get it repaired    then it broke again. Then pretty soon  I was broke too. I realized that the truly appropriate  low cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet. I needed tools that were robust  modular  highly efficient and optimized  low cost  made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime  not designed for obsolescence. I found that I would have to build them myself. So I did just that. And I tested them. And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. So then I published the  D designs  schematics  instructional videos and budgets on a wiki. Then contributors from all over the world began showing up  prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits. So far  we have prototyped eight of the    machines. And now the project is beginning to grow on its own. We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity. And the same is starting to happen with hardware too. We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways. If we can lower the barriers to farming  building  manufacturing  then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential. That's not only in the developing world. Our tools are being made for the American farmer  builder  entrepreneur  maker. We've seen lots of excitement from these people  who can now start a construction business  parts manufacturing  organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear  so complete  that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit. I've planted a hundred trees in a day. I've pressed       bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days. From what I've seen  this is only the beginning. If this idea is truly sound  then the implications are significant. A greater distribution of the means of production  environmentally sound supply chains  and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity. We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology. Thank you. So I was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers  Thomas Starzl  who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in       and Sir Roy Calne  who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K. in the following year. I returned to Singapore and  in       performed Asia's first successful cadaveric liver transplant procedure  but against all odds. Now when I look back  the transplant was actually the easiest part. Next  raising the money to fund the procedure. But perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators    a matter which was debated in the parliament    that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country. But    years on  my patient  Surinder  is Asia's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date. And perhaps more important  I am the proud godmother to her    year old son. But not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate. The truth is  there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around. As the demand for donor organs continues to rise  in large part due to the aging population  the supply has remained relatively constant. In the United States alone          men  women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs  and more than a dozen die each day because of a lack of donor organs. The transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation. And the gift of life has been extended from brain dead donors to living  related donors    relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ  like a split liver graft  to a relative or loved one. But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs  the gift of life was then extended from living  related donors to now living  unrelated donors. And this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy. How can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from  for example  a submissive spouse  an in law  a servant  a slave  an employee  Where and how can we draw the line  In my part of the world  too many people live below the poverty line. And in some areas  the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living  unrelated donors. Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant  I received my next assignment  and that was to go to the prisons to harvest organs from executed prisoners. I was also pregnant at the time. Pregnancies are meant to be happy and fulfilling moments in any woman's life. But my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts    thoughts of walking through the prison's high security death row  as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room. And at each time  I would feel the chilling stares of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me. And for two years  I struggled with the dilemma of waking up at      am on a Friday morning  driving to the prison  getting down  gloved and scrubbed  ready to receive the body of an executed prisoner  remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon. No doubt  I was informed  the consent had been obtained. But  in my life  the one fulfilling skill that I had was now invoking feelings of conflict    conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn to celebratory joy at engrafting the gift of life at dusk. In my team  the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience. Some of us may have been sublimated  but really none of us remained the same. I was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos. And in my mind  I realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence. It made me wonder if there could be a better way    a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide. Now just about that time  the practice of surgery evolved from big to small  from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures  tiny incisions. And in transplantation  concepts shifted from whole organs to cells. In       at the University of Minnesota  I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants. I witnessed the technical difficulty. And this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells. I thought to myself  why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas    the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes    and transplant these cells     technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ. And at that time  stem cell research had gained momentum  following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the     s. The observation that stem cells  as master cells  could give rise to a whole variety of different cell types    heart cells  liver cells  pancreatic islet cells    captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the public. I too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology  and this inspired a shift in my mindset  from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells. And I focused my research on stem cells as a possible source for cell transplants. Today we realize that there are many different types of stem cells. Embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage  chiefly because of their pluripotency    that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types. But the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells    the fact that these cells are derived from five day old human embryos    has encouraged research into other types of stem cells. Now to the ridicule of my colleagues  I inspired my lab to focus on what I thought was the most non controversial source of stem cells  adipose tissue  or fat  yes fat    nowadays available in abundant supply    you and I  I think  would be very happy to get rid of anyway. Fat derived stem cells are adult stem cells. And adult stem cells are found in you and me    in our blood  in our bone marrow  in our fat  our skin and other organs. And as it turns out  fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells. But adult stem cells are not embryonic stem cells. And here is the limitation  adult stem cells are mature cells  and  like mature human beings  these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell types  as embryonic stem cells  can . But in       two remarkable individuals  Shinya Yamanaka of Japan and Jamie Thomson of the United States  made an astounding discovery. They discovered that adult cells  taken from you and me  could be reprogrammed back into embryonic like cells  which they termed IPS cells  or induced pluripotent stem cells. And so guess what  scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells    aging adult cells from you and me    they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful IPS cells. And in our lab  we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells    cells that we may use to then form other  more specialized  cells  which one day may be used as cell transplants. If this research is successful  it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos. Indeed  there is a lot of hype  but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions. Heart disease  stroke  diabetes  spinal cord injury  muscular dystrophy  retinal eye diseases    are any of these conditions relevant  personally  to you  In May       something horrible happened to me. I was about to start a robotic operation  but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room  I realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness. Earlier that week  I had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing    yes  I fell. And I started to see floaters and stars  which I casually dismissed as too much high altitude sun exposure. What happened to me might have been catastrophic  if not for the fact that I was in reach of good surgical access. And I had my vision restored  but not before a prolonged period of convalescence    three months    in a head down position. This experience taught me to empathize more with my patients  and especially those with retinal diseases.    million people worldwide are blind  and     million more suffer from impaired vision. Stem cell derived retinal transplants  now in a research phase  may one day restore vision  or part vision  to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide. Indeed  we live in both challenging as well as exciting times. As the world population ages  scientists are racing to discover new ways to enhance the power of the body to heal itself through stem cells. It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured  our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation. And these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue. Stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body  or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver. As we speak  there are     or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases. What lies ahead  Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.  .  million Americans suffer heart attacks yearly.  .  million suffer cardiac failure. Stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function. There are     clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease. While still in a research phase  stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology. Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings    small  incremental steps  cells rather than organs  repair rather than replacement. Stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need for donor organs. Powerful new technologies always present enigmas. As we speak  the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the USFDA approval. And in the U.K.  neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial. The research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers. Each one has his story. My story has been about my journey from organs to cells    a journey through controversy  inspired by hope    hope that  as we age  you and I may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life. Thank you. My students often ask me   What is sociology   And I tell them   It's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don't see.  And they say   So how can I be a sociologist  How can I understand those invisible forces   And I say   Empathy. Start with empathy. It all begins with empathy. Take yourself out of your shoes  put yourself into the shoes of another person.  Here  I'll give you an example. So I imagine my life  if a hundred years ago China had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the United States in search of coal  and they found it  and  in fact  they found lots of it right here. And pretty soon  they began shipping that coal  ton by ton  rail car by rail car  boatload by boatload  back to China and elsewhere around the world. And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so. And they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal. And back here in the United States  we saw economic despair  deprivation. This is what I saw. I saw people struggling to get by  not knowing what was what and what was next. And then I asked myself the question. I say   How's it possible that we could be so poor here in the United States  because the coal is such a wealthy resource  it's so much money   And I realized  because the Chinese ingratiated themselves with a small ruling class here in the United States who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves. And the rest of us  the vast majority of us  struggle to get by. And the Chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure that people like me would not speak out against this relationship. Does this sound familiar  And they did things like train Americans to help protect the coal. And everywhere  were symbols of the Chinese    everywhere  a constant reminder. And back in China  what do they say in China  Nothing. They don't talk about us. They don't talk about the coal. If you ask them  they'll say   Well  you know the coal  we need the coal. I mean  come on  I'm not going to turn down my thermostat. You can't expect that.  And so I get angry  and I get pissed  as do lots of average people. And we fight back  and it gets really ugly. And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way. And before we know it  they send in the tanks and then send in the troops  and lots of people are dying  and it's a very  very difficult situation. Can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes  Can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there or a truck full of soldiers  And just imagine what you would feel. Because you know why they're here  and you know what they're doing here. And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear. If you can  that's empathy    that's empathy. You've left your shoes  and you've stood in mine. And you've got to feel that. Okay  so that's the warm up. That's the warm up. Now we're going to have the real radical experiment. And so for the remainder of my talk  what I want you to do is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary Arab Muslim living in the Middle East    in particular  in Iraq. And so to help you  perhaps you're a member of this middle class family in Baghdad    and what you want is the best for your kids. You want your kids to have a better life. And you watch the news  you pay attention  you read the newspaper  you go down to the coffee shop with your friends  and you read the newspapers from around the world. And sometimes you even watch satellite  CNN  from the United States. So you have a sense of what the Americans are thinking. But really  you just want a better life for yourself. That's what you want. You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq. You want a better life for yourself. So here  let me help you. Let me help you with some things that you might be thinking. Number one  this incursion into your land these past    years  and before  the reason anyone is interested in your land  and particularly the United States  it's oil. It's all about oil  you know that  everybody knows that. People here back in the United States know it's about oil. It's because somebody else has a design for your resource. It's your resource  it's not somebody else's. It's your land  it's your resource. Somebody else has a design for it. And you know why they have a design  You know why they have their eyes set on it  Because they have an entire economic system that's dependent on that oil    foreign oil  oil from other parts of the world that they don't own. And what else do you think about these people  The Americans  they're rich. Come on  they live in big houses  they have big cars  they all have blond hair  blue eyes  they're happy. You think that. It's not true  of course  but that's the media impression  and that's like what you get. And they have big cities  and the cities are all dependent on oil. And back home  what do you see  Poverty  despair  struggle. Look  you don't live in a wealthy country. This is Iraq. This is what you see. You see people struggling to get by. I mean  it's not easy  you see a lot of poverty. And you feel something about this. These people have designs for your resource  and this is what you see  Something else you see that you talk about    Americans don't talk about this  but you do. There's this thing  this militarization of the world  and it's centered right in the United States. And the United States is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending    four percent of the world's population. And you feel it  you see it every day. It's part of your life. And you talk about it with your friends. You read about it. And back when Saddam Hussein was in power  the Americans didn't care about his crimes. When he was gassing the Kurds and gassing Iran  they didn't care about it. When oil was at stake  somehow  suddenly  things mattered. And what you see  something else  the United States  the hub of democracy around the world  they don't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world. There are a lot of countries  oil producing countries  that aren't very democratic  but supported by the United States. That's odd. Oh  these incursions  these two wars  the    years of sanctions  the eight years of occupation  the insurgency that's been unleashed on your people  the tens of thousands  the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths  all because of oil. You can't help but think that. You talk about it. It's in the forefront of your mind always. You say   How is that possible   And this man  he's every man    your grandfather  your uncle  your father  your son  your neighbor  your professor  your student. Once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly  pain and sorrow. Everyone in your country has been touched by the violence  the bloodshed  the pain  the horror  everybody. Not a single person in your country has not been touched. But there's something else. There's something else about these people  these Americans who are there. There's something else about them that you see    they don't see themselves. And what do you see  They're Christians. They're Christians. They worship the Christian God  they have crosses  they carry Bibles. Their Bibles have a little insignia that says  U.S. Army  on them. And their leaders  their leaders  before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country    and you know the reason    before they send them off  they go to a Christian church  and they pray to their Christian God  and they ask for protection and guidance from that god. Why  Well  obviously  when people die in the war  they are Muslims  they are Iraqis    they're not Americans. You don't want Americans to die. Protect our troops. And you feel something about that    of course you do. And they do wonderful things. You read about it  you hear about it. They're there to build schools and help people  and that's what they want to do. They do wonderful things  but they also do the bad things  and you can't tell the difference. And this guy  you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin. I mean  here's a guy who says that your God is a false God. Your God's an idol  his God is the true God. The solution to the problem in the Middle East  according to him  is to convert you all to Christianity    just get rid of your religion. And you know that. Americans don't read about this guy. They don't know anything about him  but you do. You pass it around. You pass his words around. I mean this is serious. You're afraid. He was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of Iraq. And you're thinking   God  if this guy is saying that  then all the soldiers must be saying that.  And this word here  George Bush called this war a crusade. Man  the Americans  they're just like   Ah  crusade. Whatever. I don't know.  You know what it means. It's a holy war against Muslims. Look  invade  subdue them  take their resources. If they won't submit  kill them. That's what this is about. And you're thinking   My God  these Christians are coming to kill us.  This is frightening. You feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened. And this man  Terry Jones  I mean here's a guy who wants to burn Korans  right  And the Americans   Ah  he's a knucklehead. He's a former hotel manager  he's got three dozen members of his church.  They laugh him off. You don't laugh him off. Because in the context of everything else  all the pieces fit. I mean  of course  this is how Americans take it  so people all over the Middle East  not just in your country  are protesting.  He wants to burn Korans  our holy book. These Christians  who are these Christians  They're so evil  they're so mean    this is what they're about.  This is what you're thinking as an Arab Muslim  as an Iraqi. Of course you're going to think this. And then your cousin says   Hey cuz  check out this website. You've got to see this    Bible Boot Camp. These Christians are nuts. They're training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus. And they take these little kids and they run them through these things till they teach them how to say   Sir  yes  sir   and things like grenade toss and weapons care and maintenance. And go to the website. It says  U.S. Army  right on it. I mean  these Christians  they're nuts. How would they do this to their little kids   And you're reading this website. And of course  Christians back in the United States  or anybody  says   Ah  this is some little  tiny church in the middle of nowhere.  You don't know that. For you  this is like all Christians. It's all over the Web  Bible Boot Camp. And look at this  they even teach their kids    they train them in the same way the U.S. Marines train. Isn't that interesting. And it scares you  and it frightens you. So these guys  you see them. You see  I  Sam Richards  I know who these guys are. They're my students  my friends. I know what they're thinking   You don't know.  When you see them  they're something else  they're something else. That's what they are to you. We don't see it that way in the United States  but you see it that way. So here. Of course  you got it wrong. You're generalizing. It's wrong. You don't understand the Americans. It's not a Christian invasion. We're not just there for oil  we're there for lots of reasons. You have it wrong. You've missed it. And of course  most of you don't support the insurgency  you don't support killing Americans  you don't support the terrorists. Of course you don't. Very few people do. But some of you do. And this is a perspective. Okay  so now  here's what we're going to do. Step outside of your shoes that you're in right now and step back into your normal shoes. So everyone's back in the room  okay. Now here comes the radical experiment. So we're all back home. This photo  this woman  man  I feel her. I feel her. She's my sister  my wife  my cousin  my neighbor. She's anybody to me. These guys standing there  everybody in the photo  I feel this photo  man. So here's what I want you to do. Let's go back to my first example of the Chinese. So I want you to go there. So it's all about coal  and the Chinese are here in the United States. And what I want you to do is picture her as a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag because her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising. And the soldiers are Chinese  and everybody else is Chinese. As an American  how do you feel about this picture  What do you think about that scene  Okay  try this. Bring it back. This is the scene here. It's an American  American soldiers  American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East    in Iraq or Afghanistan. Now  put yourself in the shoes  go back to the shoes of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq. What are you feeling and thinking about this photo  about this woman  Okay  now follow me on this  because I'm taking a big risk here. And so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me. These gentlemen here  they're insurgents. They were caught by the American soldiers  trying to kill Americans. And maybe they succeeded. Maybe they succeeded. Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them. Can you feel the rage  Can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks  Can you go there  It shouldn't be that difficult. You just    oh  man. Now  put yourself in their shoes. Are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders  Which one  Can you feel their anger  their fear  their rage at what has happened in their country  Can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning bent down to their child and hugged their child and said   Dear  I'll be back later. I'm going out to defend your freedom  your lives. I'm going out to look out for us  the future of our country.  Can you imagine that  Can you imagine saying that  Can you go there  What do you think they're feeling  You see  that's empathy. It's also understanding. Now  you might ask   Okay  Sam  so why do you do this sort of thing  Why would you use this example of all examples   And I say  because ... because. You're allowed to hate these people. You're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being. And if I can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch  one tiny inch  then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life. You can walk a mile when it comes to understanding why that person's driving    miles per hour in the passing lane  or your teenage son  or your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings. Whatever it is  you can go so far. And this is what I tell my students  step outside of your tiny  little world. Step inside of the tiny  little world of somebody else. And then do it again and do it again and do it again. And suddenly all these tiny  little worlds  they come together in this complex web. And they build a big  complex world. And suddenly  without realizing it  you're seeing the world differently. Everything has changed. Everything in your life has changed. And that's  of course  what this is about. Attend to other lives  other visions. Listen to other people  enlighten ourselves. I'm not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq  but as a sociologist  what I am saying is I understand. And now perhaps    perhaps    you do too. Thank you. So it's       I'm in college  and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence  Rhode Island to Portland  Oregon. And you know  we're young and unemployed  so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests    basically the longest route we can possibly take. And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota  I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for       miles.  What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road   My friend looks at me totally blankly. There's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look. And I'm like   You know  all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them.  She just stares at me for a few moments  and then she cracks up  because she figures out what I'm talking about. And what I'm talking about is this. Right  the famous Chinese character for picnic area. I've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this    why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us  and how we behave when that happens  and what all of this can tell us about human nature. In other words  as you heard Chris say  I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong. This might strike you as a strange career move  but it actually has one great advantage  no job competition. In fact  most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong  or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong. We get it in the abstract. We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes. The human species  in general  is fallible    okay fine. But when it comes down to me  right now  to all the beliefs I hold  here in the present tense  suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window    and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about. And the thing is  the present tense is where we live. We go to meetings in the present tense  we go on family vacations in the present tense  we go to the polls and vote in the present tense. So effectively  we all kind of wind up traveling through life  trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything. I think this is a problem. I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals  in our personal and professional lives  and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture. So what I want to do today is  first of all  talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right. And second  why it's such a problem. And finally  I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so  it is the single greatest moral  intellectual and creative leap you can make. So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right  One reason  actually  has to do with a feeling of being wrong. So let me ask you guys something    or actually  let me ask you guys something  because you're right here  How does it feel    emotionally    how does it feel to be wrong  Dreadful. Thumbs down. Embarrassing. Okay  wonderful  great. Dreadful  thumbs down  embarrassing    thank you  these are great answers  but they're answers to a different question. You guys are answering the question  How does it feel to realize you're wrong  Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things  right  I mean it can be devastating  it can be revelatory  it can actually be quite funny  like my stupid Chinese character mistake. But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything. I'll give you an analogy. Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there's this pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner  In pretty much every episode of this cartoon  there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff  which is fine    he's a bird  he can fly. But the thing is  the coyote runs off the cliff right after him. And what's funny    at least if you're six years old    is that the coyote's totally fine too. He just keeps running    right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid air. That's when he falls. When we're wrong about something    not when we realize it  but before that    we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down. You know  we're already wrong  we're already in trouble  but we feel like we're on solid ground. So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago. It does feel like something to be wrong  it feels like being right. So this is one reason  a structural reason  why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness. I call this error blindness. Most of the time  we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something  until it's too late. But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well    and this one is cultural. Think back for a moment to elementary school. You're sitting there in class  and your teacher is handing back quiz papers  and one of them looks like this. This is not mine  by the way. So there you are in grade school  and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper. It's the dumb kid  the troublemaker  the one who never does his homework. So by the time you are nine years old  you've already learned  first of all  that people who get stuff wrong are lazy  irresponsible dimwits    and second of all  that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes. We learn these really bad lessons really well. And a lot of us    and I suspect  especially a lot of us in this room    deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students  perfectionists  over achievers. Right  Mr. CFO  astrophysicist  ultra marathoner  You're all CFO  astrophysicists  ultra marathoners  it turns out. Okay  so fine. Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong. Because according to this  getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us. So we just insist that we're right  because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe. So let me tell you a story. A couple of years ago  a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery. Beth Israel's in Boston. It's the teaching hospital for Harvard    one of the best hospitals in the country. So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room. She's anesthetized  the surgeon does his thing    stitches her back up  sends her out to the recovery room. Everything seems to have gone fine. And she wakes up  and she looks down at herself  and she says   Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages   Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one. When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident  he said something very interesting. He said   For whatever reason  the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient.  The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous. This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world. And when we act like it is  and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong  well that's when we end up doing things like dumping     million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico  or torpedoing the global economy. So this is a huge practical problem. But it's also a huge social problem. Think for a moment about what it means to feel right. It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality. And when you feel that way  you've got a problem to solve  which is  how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you  It turns out  most of us explain those people the same way  by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions. The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant. They don't have access to the same information that we do  and when we generously share that information with them  they're going to see the light and come on over to our team. When that doesn't work  when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us  then we move on to a second assumption  which is that they're idiots. They have all the right pieces of the puzzle  and they are too moronic to put them together correctly. And when that doesn't work  when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart  then we move on to a third assumption  they know the truth  and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes. So this is a catastrophe. This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly. But to me  what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human. It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds. And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing. That is not true  and if it were  life would be incredibly boring. The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is. It's that you can see the world as it isn't. We can remember the past  and we can think about the future  and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place. And we all do this a little differently  which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this. And yeah  it is also why we get things wrong.       years before Descartes said his famous thing about  I think therefore I am   this guy  St. Augustine  sat down and wrote  Fallor ergo sum      I err therefore I am.  Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up  it's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system  something we can eradicate or overcome. It's totally fundamental to who we are. Because  unlike God  we don't really know what's going on out there. And unlike all of the other animals  we are obsessed with trying to figure it out. To me  this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity. Last year  for various reasons  I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life. And so I'm listening and I'm listening  and at some point  I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong. And my first thought was   I've lost it. I've become the crazy wrongness lady. I just imagined it everywhere   which has happened. But a couple of months later  I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass  who's the host of the show. And I mentioned this to him  and he was like   No actually  that's true. In fact   he says   as a staff  we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto theme. And the crypto theme is  'I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.' And the thing is   says Ira Glass   we need this. We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work.  And for the rest of us  audience members  as listeners  as readers  we eat this stuff up. We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings. When it comes to our stories  we love being wrong. But  you know  our stories are like this because our lives are like this. We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead. George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq  find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction  liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East. And something else happened instead. And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life  until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son. And something else happened instead. And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together. And something else happened instead. And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize. And something else happened instead. I mean  this is life. For good and for ill  we generate these incredible stories about the world around us  and then the world turns around and astonishes us. No offense  but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong. We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements  but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements  Because half the stuff that's the most mind boggling and world altering    TED         eh. Didn't really work out that way  did it  Where's my jet pack  Chris  So here we are again. And that's how it goes. We come up with another idea. We tell another story. We hold another conference. The theme of this one  as you guys have now heard seven million times  is the rediscovery of wonder. And to me  if you really want to rediscover wonder  you need to step outside of that tiny  terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say   Wow  I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.  Thank you. Thank you guys. I'm very fortunate to be here. I feel so fortunate. I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me. I called my wife Leslie  and I said   You know  there's so many good people trying to do so much good. It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels.  It's a true feeling. But let me get to the talk    I see the clock is running. I'm a public school teacher  and I just want to share a story of my superintendent. Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County  Virginia  the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. And she's a very high tech superintendent. She uses smart boards  she blogs  she Tweets  she does Facebook  she does all this sort of high tech stuff. She's a technology leader and instructional leader. But in her office  there's this old wooden  weather worn table  kitchen table    peeling green paint  it's kind of rickety. And I said   Pam  you're such a modern  cutting edge person. Why is this old table in your office   And she told me  she said   You know  I grew up in Southwestern Virginia  in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia  and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen. And we'd come in from playing  he'd come in from plowing and working  and we'd sit around that table every night. And as I grew up  I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table  I began to call it the wisdom table. And when he passed on  I took this table with me and brought it to my office  and it reminds me of him. It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes.  The project I'm going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game  and essentially it is also an empty space. And I'd like to think of it as a   st century wisdom table  really. It all started back in     . I was a young man  and I had been dropping in and out of college. And my parents were very patient  but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest. And I remember the last time I came back from India    in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses    and I said to my father   Dad  I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment.  He said   Well there's one more thing you need to find.  I said   What is that  dad    A job.  And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something. So I got a degree and it turned out to be education. It was an experimental education program. It could have been dentistry  but the word  experimental  was in it  and so that's what I had to go for. And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia  the capital city  bought a three piece suit    my concession to convention    kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes    at the time it was the '  s    and I walked in  and I sat down and had an interview. And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor  her name was Anna Aro  said I had the job teaching gifted children. And I was so shocked  so stunned  I got up and said   Well  thank you  but what do I do   Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much. There weren't really many materials or things to use. And I said   What do I do   And her answer shocked me. It stunned me. Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that. She said   What do you want to do   And that question cleared the space. There was no program directive  no manual to follow  no standards in gifted education in that way. And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students  an empty space  whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding. So this happened in       and I was teaching many years later  and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker. His name is Chris Farina. Chris Farina is here today at his own cost. Chris  could you stand up and let them see you    a young  visionary filmmaker who's made a film. This film is called  World Peace and Other  th Grade Achievements.  He proposed the film to me    it's a great title. He proposed the film to me  and I said   Yeah  maybe it'll be on local TV  and we can say hi to our friends.  But the film has really gone places. Now it's still in debt  but Chris has managed  through his own sacrifice  to get this film out. So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me  more than a story about one teacher. It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers. And it's a beautiful thing. And the strange thing is  when I watch the film    I have the eerie sensation of seeing it    I saw myself literally disappear. What I saw was my teachers coming through me. I saw my geometry teacher in high school  Mr. Rucell's wry smile under his handlebar mustache. That's the smile I use    that's his smile. I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes. And they weren't flashing in anger  they were flashing in love  intense love for her students. And I have that kind of flash sometimes. And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high heels to elementary school every day. And you know  she had that old school teacher stare. You know the one.  And I'm not even talking about you behind me  because I've got eyes in the back of my head.  You know that teacher  I didn't use that stare very often  but I do have it in my repertoire. And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me. And then I saw my own parents  my first teachers. My father  very inventive  spatial thinker. That's my brother Malcolm there on the right. And my mother  who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia  who was my inspiration. And really  I feel as though  when I see the film    I have a gesture she does  like this    I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture. I am one of her teaching gestures. And the beautiful thing was  I got to teach my daughter in elementary school  Madeline. And so that gesture of my mother's continues through many generations. It's an amazing feeling to have that lineage. And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people. I'm not here alone. There are many people on this stage right now. And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about. It started out like this  it's just a four foot by five foot plywood board in an inner city urban school      . I was creating a lesson for students on Africa. We put all the problems of the world there  and I thought  let's let them solve it. I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading. I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies. So I thought  well they like to play games. I'll make something    I didn't say interactive  we didn't have that term in         but something interactive. And so we made the game  and it has since evolved to a four foot by four foot by four foot Plexiglass structure. And it has four Plexiglass layers. There's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining. There's an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces  a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it    even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining. There are four countries around the board. The kids make up the names of the countries    some are rich  some are poor. They have different assets  commercial and military. And each country has a cabinet. There's a Prime Minister  Secretary of State  Minister of Defense and a CFO  or Comptroller. I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them. I offer them the job  they can turn it down  and then they choose their own cabinet. There's a World Bank  arms dealers and a United Nations. There's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather. That's not all. And then there's a    page crisis document with    interlocking problems. So that  if one thing changes  everything else changes. I throw them into this complex matrix  and they trust me because we have a deep  rich relationship together. And so with all these crises  we have    let's see    ethnic and minority tensions  we have chemical and nuclear spills  nuclear proliferation. There's oil spills  environmental disasters  water rights disputes  breakaway republics  famine  endangered species and global warming. If Al Gore is here  I'm going to send my fourth graders from Agnor Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week. And they've done it several times too. So I also have in the game a saboteur    some child    it's basically a troublemaker    and I have my troublemaker put to use because they  on the surface  are trying to save the world and their position in the game. But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game. And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies  trying to cause everyone to think more deeply. The saboteur is there  and we also read from Sun Tzu's  The Art of War.  Fourth graders understand it    nine years old    and they handle that and use that to understand how to  not follow    at first they do    the paths to power and destruction  the path to war. They learn to overlook short sighted reactions and impulsive thinking  to think in a long term  more consequential way. Stewart Brand is here  and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force. And in the game  sometimes students actually form a peace force. I'm just a clock watcher. I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator. The students run the game. I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing. So I'll just share with you ... You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world. See  Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot  and he's trying to tell us how to fix that problem. John Hunter  I offered them a    Actually  I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer. And I admit the truth to them right up front  I don't know. And because I don't know  they've got to dig up the answer. And so I apologize to them as well. I say   I'm so sorry  boys and girls  but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape  and we hope you can fix it for us  and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it.  It's a sincere apology  and they take it very seriously. Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like. Well when we have the game start  here's what you see. JH  My question to you is  who's in charge of that classroom  It's a serious question  who is really in charge  I've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time. There's a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don't have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher  control every conversation and response in the classroom. It's impossible. Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine  and I admit it to them openly. So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened. In this game we had a little girl  and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation. And the Defense Minister    she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth. And she was next door to a very wealthy  oil rich neighbor. Without provocation  suddenly she attacked  against her Prime Minister's orders  the next door neighbor's oil fields. She marched into the oil field reserves  surrounded it  without firing a shot  and secured it and held it. And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up. We were all upset with her   Why are you doing this  This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you   This was a little girl and  at nine years old  she held her pieces and said   I know what I'm doing.  To her girlfriends she said that. That's a breach there. And we learned in this  you don't really ever want to cross a nine year old girl with tanks. They are the toughest opponents. And we were very upset. I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this  But come to find out  a few game days later    and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team    actually there's a negotiation period with all teams  and each team takes a turn  then we go back in negotiation  around and around  so each turn around is one game day. So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world. Had they had their fuel supplies  they would have done it. She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game. Now she used a small war to avert a larger war  so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right  conditional good  or not right. That's the kind of thinking that we put them in  the situations. I could not have designed that in teaching it. It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom. Another example  a beautiful thing happened. We have a letter in the game. If you're a military commander and you wage troops    the little plastic toys on the board    and you lose them  I put in a letter. You have to write a letter to their parents    the fictional parents of your fictional troops    explaining what happened and offering your condolences. So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat. And so we had this situation come up    last summer actually  at Agnor Hurt School in Albemarle County    and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said   Mr. Hunter  let's ask    there's a parent over there.  There was a parent visiting that day  just sitting in the back of the room.  Let's ask that mom to read the letter. It'll be more realer if she reads it.  So we did  we asked her  and she gamely picked up the letter.  Sure.  She started reading. She read one sentence. She read two sentences. By the third sentence  she was in tears. I was in tears. Everybody understood that when we lose somebody  the winners are not gloating. We all lose. And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding. I'll show you what my friend David says about this. He's been in many battles. I mean  we've been lucky  most of  the time. But now I'm feeling really weird because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week. One week he said   Those who go into battle and win will want to go back  and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win.  And so I've been winning battles  so I'm going into battles  more battles. And I think it's sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said. JH  I get chills every time I see that. That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen. And I can't design that  I can't plan that  and I can't even test that. But it's self evident assessment. We know that's an authentic assessment of learning. We have a lot of data  but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on. So I'll just share a third story. This is about my friend Brennan. We had played the game one session after school for many weeks  about seven weeks  and we had essentially solved all    of the interlocking crises. The way the game is won is all    problems have to be solved and every country's asset value has to be increased above its starting point. Some are poor  some are wealthy. There are billions. The World Bank president was a third grader one time. He says   How many zeros in a trillion  I've got to calculate that right away.  But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him. So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer. There was no way they could win. And we were approaching four o'clock  our cut off time    there was about a minute left    and despair just settled over the room. I thought  I'm failing as a teacher. I should have gotten it so they could have won. They shouldn't be failing like this. I've failed them. And I was just feeling so sad and dejected. And suddenly  Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell  the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets  and he ran back to his seat  rang the bell. Everybody ran to his chair  there was screaming  there was yelling  waving of their dossiers. They get these dossiers full of secret documents. They were gesticulating  they were running around. I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom. Principal walks in  I'm out of a job. The parents were looking in the window. And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat. He rings the bell again. He says   We have     and there's    seconds left on the clock     we have  all nations  pooled all our funds together. And we've got     billion dollars. We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country. And if they accept it  it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game. Will you accept it   And there are three seconds left on the clock. Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country  and he says   Yes.  And the game is won. Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for  that was unexpected and unpredictable. Every game we play is different. Some games are more about social issues  some are more about economic issues. Some games are more about warfare. But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human. I allow them to go there and  through their own experience  learn  in a bloodless way  how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing. And they find out what is right their own way  their own selves. And so in this game  I've learned so much from it  but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world  they may save us all. If only. And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I'm standing  thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon  which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it. My own interest in this subject  and my passion for it  began rather accidentally. I had bought a copy of this book   The Universe and Dr. Einstein     a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle. A few years after that  in Bangalore  I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night  and I picked up this book  thinking it would put me to sleep in    minutes. And as it happened  I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot. And I was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do. And that feeling hasn't left me yet. That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career    from being a software engineer to become a science writer    so that I could partake in the joy of science  and also the joy of communicating it to others. And that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts  to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes  detectors  instruments that people are building  or have built  in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail. So it took me from places like Chile    the Atacama Desert in Chile    to Siberia  to underground mines in the Japanese Alps  in Northern America  all the way to Antarctica and even to the South Pole. And today I would like to share with you some images  some stories of these trips. I have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting  literally at times  their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe. And I first begin with a pie chart    and I promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation    but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos. All the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter    the stuff that we're all made of    and that's four percent of the universe. Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe  which makes up    percent of the universe  and something called dark energy  which permeates the fabric of space time  that makes up another    percent. So if you look at this pie chart     percent of the universe  at this point in our exploration of it  is unknown or not well understood. And most of the experiments  telescopes that I went to see are in some way addressing this question  these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter. And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors. And the reason why they have to go underground is that  if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth  the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays  ambient radio activity  even our own bodies. You might not believe it  but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment. So they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector. And I went to see one of these experiments  and this is actually    you can barely see it  and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there    this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in     . And physicists came and started using it sometime in the     s. And the miners in the early part of the last century worked  literally  in candlelight. And today  you would see this inside the mine  half a mile underground. This is one of the largest underground labs in the world. And  among other things  they're looking for dark matter. There is another way to search for dark matter  which is indirectly. If dark matter exists in our universe  in our galaxy  then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about    one of them being neutrinos. And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules. When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light  a flash of blue light  and by looking for this blue light  you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then  indirectly  something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino. But you need very  very large volumes of water in order to do this. You need something like tens of megatons of water    almost a gigaton of water    in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino. And where in the world would you find such water  Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard. This is Lake Baikal. It is the largest lake in the world. It's     km long. It's about    to    km wide in most places  and one to two kilometers deep. And what the Russians are doing is they're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light. And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there. This is Lake Baikal in the peak of the Siberian winter. The lake is entirely frozen. And the line of black dots that you see in the background  that's the ice camp where the physicists are working. The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring  which  if they did that  they would need ships and submersibles to do their work. So they wait until winter    the lake is completely frozen over    and they use this meter thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work. So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter. They have to drill holes in the ice  dive down into the water    cold  cold water    to get hold of the instrument  bring it up  do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do  put it back and get out before the ice melts. Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it's full of cracks. And you have to imagine  there's an entire sea like lake underneath  moving. I still don't understand this one Russian man working in his bare chest  but that tells you how hard he was working. And these people  a handful of people  have been working for    years  looking for particles that may or may not exist. And they have dedicated their lives to it. And just to give you an idea  they have spent    million over    years. It's very harsh conditions. They work on a shoestring budget. The toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack. And it's that basic  but they do this every year. From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile  to see something called The Very Large Telescope. The Very Large Telescope is one of these things that astronomers do    they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively. I can tell you for a fact  that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope. And you wouldn't believe it  but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. But nonetheless  it's an extraordinary piece of engineering. These are four  .  meter telescopes. And these telescopes  among other things  they're being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time. And the more you understand that  the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about. And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror. Each mirror  there are four of them  is made of a single piece of glass  a monolithic piece of high tech ceramic  that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is  to  imagine a city like Paris  with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower  if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy  you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high. And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured. An extraordinary set of telescopes. Here's another view of the same. The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the Atacama Desert is because of the high altitude desert. The dry air is really good for telescopes  and also  the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about     days of clear skies. Finally  I want to take you to Antarctica. I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world. This is cosmology's final frontier. Some of the most amazing experiments  some of the most extreme experiments  are being done in Antarctica. I was there to view something called a long duration balloon flight  which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere  the upper stratosphere     km up. And that's where they do their experiments  and then the balloon  the payload  is brought down. So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. That's an American C    cargo plane that flew us from New Zealand to McMurdo in Antarctica. And here we are about to board our bus. And I don't know if you can read the lettering  but it says   Ivan the Terribus.  And that's taking us to McMurdo. And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo. And you barely might be able to make out this hut here. This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men when they first came to Antarctica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole. Because it's so cold  the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it  with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there. It's an extraordinary place. This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer  and about     in winter when it's completely dark for six months. I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument. This is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper stratosphere to an altitude of    km. What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight. So you're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of    km. And the engineers  the technicians  the physicists have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf  because Antarctica    I won't go into the reasons why    but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches  except for the weather. The weather  as you can imagine  this is summer  and you're standing on     ft of ice. And there's a volcano behind  which has glaciers at the very top. And what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon    the fabric  parachute and everything    on the ice and then fill it up with helium. And that process takes about two hours. And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly. For instance  here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind  which is eventually going to be filled up with helium. Those two trucks you see at the very end carry    tanks each of compressed helium. Now  in case the weather changes before the launch  they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station. And this particular balloon  because it has to launch two tons of weight  is an extremely huge balloon. The fabric alone weighs two tons. In order to minimize the weight  it's very thin  it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper. And if they have to pack it back  they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again    except  when they did it first  it would have been done in Texas. Here  they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing  so they have to take their shoes off  get barefoot into the boxes  in this cold  and do that kind of work. That's the kind of dedication these people have. Here's the balloon being filled up with helium  and you can see it's a gorgeous sight. Here's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end to end. So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left hand side  and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute  and then the parachute is then connected to the payload. And remember  all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold  in sub zero temperatures. They're wearing about    kg of clothing and stuff  but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that. And I would like to share with you a launch. release the balloon  release the balloon. Anil Ananthaswamy  And I'll finally like to leave you with two images. This is an observatory in the Himalayas  in Ladakh in India. And the thing I want you to look at here is the telescope on the right hand side. And on the far left there is a     year old Buddhist monastery. This is a close up of the Buddhist monastery. And I was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has. One is exploring the cosmos on the outside  and the other one is exploring our interior being. And both require silence of some sort. And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these telescopes  the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence  whether it's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever. And it was very obvious that  if we destroy these silent places on Earth  we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards  because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space. Thank you. Imagine a big explosion as you climb through       ft. Imagine a plane full of smoke. Imagine an engine going clack  clack  clack. It sounds scary. Well  I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in  D. I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants. So I looked at them right away  and they said   No problem. We probably hit some birds.  The pilot had already turned the plane around  and we weren't that far. You could see Manhattan. Two minutes later  three things happened at the same time. The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River. That's usually not the route. He turns off the engines. Now  imagine being in a plane with no sound. And then he says three words. The most unemotional three words I've ever heard. He says   Brace for impact.  I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore. I could see in her eyes  it was terror. Life was over. Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day. I learned that it all changes in an instant. We have this bucket list  we have these things we want to do in life  and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't  all the fences I wanted to mend  all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did. As I thought about that later on  I came up with a saying  which is   I collect bad wines.  Because if the wine is ready and the person is there  I'm opening it. I no longer want to postpone anything in life. And that urgency  that purpose  has really changed my life. The second thing I learned that day    and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge  which was by not a lot    I thought about  wow  I really feel one real regret. I've lived a good life. In my own humanity and mistakes  I've tried to get better at everything I tried. But in my humanity  I also allow my ego to get in. And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter. And I thought about my relationship with my wife  with my friends  with people. And after  as I reflected on that  I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life. It's not perfect  but it's a lot better. I've not had a fight with my wife in two years. It feels great. I no longer try to be right  I choose to be happy. The third thing I learned    and this is as your mental clock starts going             .  You can see the water coming. I'm saying   Please blow up.  I don't want this thing to break in    pieces like you've seen in those documentaries. And as we're coming down  I had a sense of  wow  dying is not scary. It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives. But it was very sad. I didn't want to go  I love my life. And that sadness really framed in one thought  which is  I only wish for one thing. I only wish I could see my kids grow up. About a month later  I was at a performance by my daughter    first grader  not much artistic talent    Yet  And I'm bawling  I'm crying  like a little kid. And it made all the sense in the world to me. I realized at that point  by connecting those two dots  that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad. Above all  above all  the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad. I was given the gift of a miracle  of not dying that day. I was given another gift  which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently. I challenge you guys that are flying today  imagine the same thing happens on your plane    and please don't    but imagine  and how would you change  What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever  How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them  And more than anything  are you being the best parent you can  Thank you. How would you like to be better than you are  Suppose I said that  with just a few changes in your genes  you could get a better memory    more precise  more accurate and quicker. Or maybe you'd like to be more fit  stronger  with more stamina. Would you like to be more attractive and self confident  How about living longer with good health  Or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity. Which one would you like the most  Which would you like  if you could have just one  Creativity. How many people would choose creativity  Raise your hands. Let me see. A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here. How many would opt for memory  Quite a few more. How about fitness  A few less. What about longevity  Ah  the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor. If you could have any one of these  it would be a very different world. Is it just imaginary  Or  is it  perhaps  possible  Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED Conference  but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject. The great   th century geneticist  T.G. Dobzhansky  who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church  once wrote an essay that he titled  Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution.  Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution  this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid  take out your personal communications device    I give you permission    and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong  because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. But if you do accept biological evolution  consider this  is it just about the past  or is it about the future  Does it apply to others  or does it apply to us  This is another look at the tree of life. In this picture  I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions  because if you look at the edges of the tree of life  every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms  it has survived  it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment. The human part of this branch  way out on one end  is  of course  the one that we are most interested in. We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago. In the interval  there have been perhaps    or    different species of hominids. Some have come and gone. We have been here for about         years. It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life  but actually  for the most part  the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same. Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics  This is not like human insulin  this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas. And speaking of bacteria  do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body  Maybe    times more. I mean think of it  when Antonio Damasio asks about your self image  do you think about the bacteria  Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria. It's warm  it's dark  it's moist  it's very cozy. And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part. It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria  with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit. But otherwise  you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria  just as they are essential to your life. They help in the digestion of essential nutrients  and they protect you against certain diseases. But what will come in the future  Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species  Or  are we destined to become something different    something  perhaps  even better adapted to the environment  Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang     billion years ago    the Earth  the solar system  about four and a half billion years    the first signs of proto life  maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth    the first multi celled organisms  perhaps as much as     or a billion years ago    and then the human species  finally emerging in the last         years. In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe  life on Earth is like a brief measure  the animal kingdom  like a single measure  and human life  a small grace note. That was us. That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk  so I hope you enjoyed it. Now when I was a freshman in college  I took my first biology class. I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology. I became enamored of the power of evolution  and I realized something very fundamental  in most of the existence of life in single celled organisms  each cell simply divides  and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells. But at the time multi celled organisms come online  things start to change. Sexual reproduction enters the picture. And very importantly  with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome  the rest of the body becomes expendable. In fact  you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction. Now I have to confess  when I was a college undergraduate  I thought  okay  sex death  sex death  death for sex    it seemed pretty reasonable at the time  but with each passing year  I've come to have increasing doubts. I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns  who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his   s. And one night  there's a knock at his hotel room door. He answers the door. Standing before him is a gorgeous  scantily clad showgirl. She looks at him and says   I'm here for super sex.   That's fine   says George   I'll take the soup.  I came to realize  as a physician  that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution    not necessarily contradictory  just different. I was trying to preserve the body. I wanted to keep us healthy. I wanted to restore health from disease. I wanted us to live long and healthy lives. Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation  adapting and surviving through generation after generation. From an evolutionary point of view  you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea. I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said   I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying.  Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest lived. It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest  and not even the smartest. Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. That is the sole test of survival and success. At the bottom of the ocean  bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce  if fish were there  sous vide cooked fish  nevertheless  have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them. So what does this mean  as we look back at what has happened in evolution  and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution  and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase  I would say that there are a number of possibilities. The first is that we will not evolve. We have reached a kind of equipoise. And the reasoning behind that would be  first  we have  through medicine  managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population. And secondly  we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it. And by the way  we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place. A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind  natural  imposed by the forces of nature. And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly  but they are inexorable. And as far as isolation goes  when we as a species do colonize distant planets  there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way. But there's a third possibility  an enticing  intriguing and frightening possibility. I call it neo evolution    the new evolution that is not simply natural  but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make. Now how could this come about  How could it be possible that we would do this  Consider  first  the reality that people today  in some cultures  are making choices about their offspring. They're  in some cultures  choosing to have more males than females. It's not necessarily good for the society  but it's what the individual and the family are choosing. Think also  if it were possible ever for you to choose  not simply to choose the sex of your child  but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases. What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke  Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes  If we look ahead  these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible. The Human Genome Project started in       and it took    years. It cost  .  billion dollars. The year after it was finished in       you could do the same job for    million dollars in three to four months. Today  you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about        dollars and in the space of about a week. It won't be very long before the reality will be the       dollar human genome  and it will be increasingly available for everyone. Just a week ago  the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer  two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way    what Frances Arnold calls  directed evolution.  A couple of years ago  the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell  a fibroblast  and by manipulating just four genes  he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell    a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body. These changes are coming. The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves  but induce immunity against other viruses. Believe it or not  there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant. Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco  These are all reality today  and  in  the future  will be evermore possible. Imagine then just two other little changes. You can change the cells in your body  but what if you could change the cells in your offspring  What if you could change the sperm and the ova  or change the newly fertilized egg  and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life    eliminate the diabetes  eliminate the hemophilia  reduce the risk of cancer  Who doesn't want healthier children  And then  that same analytic technology  that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease  will also enable us to adopt super attributes  hyper capacities    that better memory. Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings  especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine  Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer  Why not live longer  These will be irresistible. And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation  and we can adopt the attributes we want  we will have converted old style evolution into neo evolution. We'll take a process that normally might require         years  and we can compress it down to a thousand years    and maybe even in the next     years. These are choices that your grandchildren  or their grandchildren  are going to have before them. Will we use these choices to make a society that is better  that is more successful  that is kinder  Or  will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us  Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform  or more robust and more versatile  These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face. And most profoundly of all  will we ever be able to develop the wisdom  and to inherit the wisdom  that we'll need to make these choices wisely  For better or worse  and sooner than you may think  these choices will be up to us. Thank you. So security is two different things  it's a feeling  and it's a reality. And they're different. You could feel secure even if you're not. And you can be secure even if you don't feel it. Really  we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word. And what I want to do in this talk is to split them apart    figuring out when they diverge and how they converge. And language is actually a problem here. There aren't a lot of good words for the concepts we're going to talk about. So if you look at security from economic terms  it's a trade off. Every time you get some security  you're always trading off something. Whether this is a personal decision    whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home    or a national decision    where you're going to invade some foreign country    you're going to trade off something  either money or time  convenience  capabilities  maybe fundamental liberties. And the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer  but whether it's worth the trade off. You've heard in the past several years  the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is not in power. That might be true  but it's not terribly relevant. The question is  was it worth it  And you can make your own decision  and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it. That's how you think about security    in terms of the trade off. Now there's often no right or wrong here. Some of us have a burglar alarm system at home  and some of us don't. And it'll depend on where we live  whether we live alone or have a family  how much cool stuff we have  how much we're willing to accept the risk of theft. In politics also  there are different opinions. A lot of times  these trade offs are about more than just security  and I think that's really important. Now people have a natural intuition about these trade offs. We make them every day    last night in my hotel room  when I decided to double lock the door  or you in your car when you drove here  when we go eat lunch and decide the food's not poison and we'll eat it. We make these trade offs again and again  multiple times a day. We often won't even notice them. They're just part of being alive  we all do it. Every species does it. Imagine a rabbit in a field  eating grass  and the rabbit's going to see a fox. That rabbit will make a security trade off   Should I stay  or should I flee   And if you think about it  the rabbits that are good at making that trade off will tend to live and reproduce  and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve. So you'd think that us  as a successful species on the planet    you  me  everybody    would be really good at making these trade offs. Yet it seems  again and again  that we're hopelessly bad at it. And I think that's a fundamentally interesting question. I'll give you the short answer. The answer is  we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality. Now most of the time  that works. Most of the time  feeling and reality are the same. Certainly that's true for most of human prehistory. We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense. One way to think of it is that we're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the East African highlands in         B.C.      New York  not so much. Now there are several biases in risk perception. A lot of good experiments in this. And you can see certain biases that come up again and again. So I'll give you four. We tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks    so flying versus driving. The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar. One example would be  people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common. This is for children. Third  personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks    so Bin Laden is scarier because he has a name. And the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don't control. So once you take up skydiving or smoking  you downplay the risks. If a risk is thrust upon you    terrorism was a good example    you'll overplay it because you don't feel like it's in your control. There are a bunch of other of these biases  these cognitive biases  that affect our risk decisions. There's the availability heuristic  which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind. So you can imagine how that works. If you hear a lot about tiger attacks  there must be a lot of tigers around. You don't hear about lion attacks  there aren't a lot of lions around. This works until you invent newspapers. Because what newspapers do is they repeat again and again rare risks. I tell people  if it's in the news  don't worry about it. Because by definition  news is something that almost never happens. When something is so common  it's no longer news    car crashes  domestic violence    those are the risks you worry about. We're also a species of storytellers. We respond to stories more than data. And there's some basic innumeracy going on. I mean  the joke  One  Two  Three  Many  is kind of right. We're really good at small numbers. One mango  two mangoes  three mangoes         mangoes          mangoes    it's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot. So one half  one quarter  one fifth    we're good at that. One in a million  one in a billion    they're both almost never. So we have trouble with the risks that aren't very common. And what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality. And the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack  they get different. Now you either have a feeling    you feel more secure than you are. There's a false sense of security. Or the other way  and that's a false sense of insecurity. I write a lot about  security theater   which are products that make people feel secure  but don't actually do anything. There's no real word for stuff that makes us secure  but doesn't make us feel secure. Maybe it's what the CIA's supposed to do for us. So back to economics. If economics  if the market  drives security  and if people make trade offs based on the feeling of security  then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives are to make people feel secure. And there are two ways to do this. One  you can make people actually secure and hope they notice. Or two  you can make people just feel secure and hope they don't notice. So what makes people notice  Well a couple of things  understanding of the security  of the risks  the threats  the countermeasures  how they work. But if you know stuff  you're more likely to have your feelings match reality. Enough real world examples helps. Now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood  because we live there  and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality. Security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly. Okay  so what makes people not notice  Well  a poor understanding. If you don't understand the risks  you don't understand the costs  you're likely to get the trade off wrong  and your feeling doesn't match reality. Not enough examples. There's an inherent problem with low probability events. If  for example  terrorism almost never happens  it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter terrorist measures. This is why you keep sacrificing virgins  and why your unicorn defenses are working just great. There aren't enough examples of failures. Also  feelings that are clouding the issues    the cognitive biases I talked about earlier  fears  folk beliefs  basically an inadequate model of reality. So let me complicate things. I have feeling and reality. I want to add a third element. I want to add model. Feeling and model in our head  reality is the outside world. It doesn't change  it's real. So feeling is based on our intuition. Model is based on reason. That's basically the difference. In a primitive and simple world  there's really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality. You don't need a model. But in a modern and complex world  you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face. There's no feeling about germs. You need a model to understand them. So this model is an intelligent representation of reality. It's  of course  limited by science  by technology. We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them. It's limited by our cognitive biases. But it has the ability to override our feelings. Where do we get these models  We get them from others. We get them from religion  from culture  teachers  elders. A couple years ago  I was in South Africa on safari. The tracker I was with grew up in Kruger National Park. He had some very complex models of how to survive. And it depended on if you were attacked by a lion or a leopard or a rhino or an elephant    and when you had to run away  and when you couldn't run away  and when you had to climb a tree    when you could never climb a tree. I would have died in a day  but he was born there  and he understood how to survive. I was born in New York City. I could have taken him to New York  and he would have died in a day. Because we had different models based on our different experiences. Models can come from the media  from our elected officials. Think of models of terrorism  child kidnapping  airline safety  car safety. Models can come from industry. The two I'm following are surveillance cameras  ID cards  quite a lot of our computer security models come from there. A lot of models come from science. Health models are a great example. Think of cancer  of bird flu  swine flu  SARS. All of our feelings of security about those diseases come from models given to us  really  by science filtered through the media. So models can change. Models are not static. As we become more comfortable in our environments  our model can move closer to our feelings. So an example might be  if you go back     years ago when electricity was first becoming common  there were a lot of fears about it. I mean  there were people who were afraid to push doorbells  because there was electricity in there  and that was dangerous. For us  we're very facile around electricity. We change light bulbs without even thinking about it. Our model of security around electricity is something we were born into. It hasn't changed as we were growing up. And we're good at it. Or think of the risks on the Internet across generations    how your parents approach Internet security  versus how you do  versus how our kids will. Models eventually fade into the background. Intuitive is just another word for familiar. So as your model is close to reality  and it converges with feelings  you often don't know it's there. So a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu. When swine flu first appeared  the initial news caused a lot of overreaction. Now it had a name  which made it scarier than the regular flu  even though it was more deadly. And people thought doctors should be able to deal with it. So there was that feeling of lack of control. And those two things made the risk more than it was. As the novelty wore off  the months went by  there was some amount of tolerance  people got used to it. There was no new data  but there was less fear. By autumn  people thought the doctors should have solved this already. And there's kind of a bifurcation    people had to choose between fear and acceptance    actually fear and indifference    they kind of chose suspicion. And when the vaccine appeared last winter  there were a lot of people    a surprising number    who refused to get it    as a nice example of how people's feelings of security change  how their model changes  sort of wildly with no new information  with no new input. This kind of thing happens a lot. I'm going to give one more complication. We have feeling  model  reality. I have a very relativistic view of security. I think it depends on the observer. And most security decisions have a variety of people involved. And stakeholders with specific trade offs will try to influence the decision. And I call that their agenda. And you see agenda    this is marketing  this is politics    trying to convince you to have one model versus another  trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings  marginalizing people with models you don't like. This is not uncommon. An example  a great example  is the risk of smoking. In the history of the past    years  the smoking risk shows how a model changes  and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like. Compare that to the secondhand smoke debate    probably about    years behind. Think about seat belts. When I was a kid  no one wore a seat belt. Nowadays  no kid will let you drive if you're not wearing a seat belt. Compare that to the airbag debate    probably about    years behind. All examples of models changing. What we learn is that changing models is hard. Models are hard to dislodge. If they equal your feelings  you don't even know you have a model. And there's another cognitive bias I'll call confirmation bias  where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs. So evidence against our model  we're likely to ignore  even if it's compelling. It has to get very compelling before we'll pay attention. New models that extend long periods of time are hard. Global warming is a great example. We're terrible at models that span    years. We can do to the next harvest. We can often do until our kids grow up. But    years  we're just not good at. So it's a very hard model to accept. We can have both models in our head simultaneously  right  that kind of problem where we're holding both beliefs together  right  the cognitive dissonance. Eventually  the new model will replace the old model. Strong feelings can create a model. September   th created a security model in a lot of people's heads. Also  personal experiences with crime can do it  personal health scare  a health scare in the news. You'll see these called flashbulb events by psychiatrists. They can create a model instantaneously  because they're very emotive. So in the technological world  we don't have experience to judge models. And we rely on others. We rely on proxies. I mean  this works as long as it's to correct others. We rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe. I flew here yesterday. I didn't check the airplane. I relied on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly. We're here  none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us  not because we checked  but because we're pretty sure the building codes here are good. It's a model we just accept pretty much by faith. And that's okay. Now  what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models    have it reflected in their feelings    to allow them to make security trade offs. Now when these go out of whack  you have two options. One  you can fix people's feelings  directly appeal to feelings. It's manipulation  but it can work. The second  more honest way is to actually fix the model. Change happens slowly. The smoking debate took    years  and that was an easy one. Some of this stuff is hard. I mean really though  information seems like our best hope. And I lied. Remember I said feeling  model  reality  I said reality doesn't change. It actually does. We live in a technological world  reality changes all the time. So we might have    for the first time in our species    feeling chases model  model chases reality  reality's moving    they might never catch up. We don't know. But in the long term  both feeling and reality are important. And I want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this.         I don't know if people will remember this    there was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings in the United States. It's a horrific story. Someone took a bottle of Tylenol  put poison in it  closed it up  put it back on the shelf. Someone else bought it and died. This terrified people. There were a couple of copycat attacks. There wasn't any real risk  but people were scared. And this is how the tamper proof drug industry was invented. Those tamper proof caps  that came from this. It's complete security theater. As a homework assignment  think of    ways to get around it. I'll give you one  a syringe. But it made people feel better. It made their feeling of security more match the reality. Last story  a few years ago  a friend of mine gave birth. I visit her in the hospital. It turns out when a baby's born now  they put an RFID bracelet on the baby  put a corresponding one on the mother  so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward  an alarm goes off. I said   Well  that's kind of neat. I wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals.  I go home  I look it up. It basically never happens. But if you think about it  if you are a hospital  and you need to take a baby away from its mother  out of the room to run some tests  you better have some good security theater  or she's going to rip your arm off. So it's important for us  those of us who design security  who look at security policy  or even look at public policy in ways that affect security. It's not just reality  it's feeling and reality. What's important is that they be about the same. It's important that  if our feelings match reality  we make better security trade offs. Thank you. I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials. I brought along with me an abalone shell. This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that's    percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein. Yet  it's       times tougher than its geological counterpart. And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells  like chalk. I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials  and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job. Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure  but they're formed at the nanoscale. They're formed at the nanoscale  and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures. So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non living structures  like batteries and like solar cells  What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did  in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure  using non toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment  So that's the vision that I've been thinking about. And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish  Or  what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time  and do so in an environmentally friendly way  And so  going back to this abalone shell  besides being nano structured  one thing that's fascinating  is when a male and a female abalone get together  they pass on the genetic information that says   This is how to build an exquisite material. Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure  using non toxic materials.  Same with diatoms  which are shown right here  which are glasseous structures. Every time the diatoms replicate  they give the genetic information that says   Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nano structured. And you can do it the same  over and over again.  So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery  I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old. But anyone who's ever had  or knows  small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms. And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do  it's very difficult. So when we think about future technologies  we actually think of using bacteria and virus  simple organisms. Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox  so that they can build a structure that will be important to me  Also  when we think about future technologies  we start with the beginning of Earth. Basically  it took a billion years to have life on Earth. And very rapidly  they became multi cellular  they could replicate  they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source. But it wasn't until about     million years ago    during the Cambrian geologic time period    that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials. Before that  they were all soft  fluffy structures. And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment  and organisms learned how to make hard materials. And so that's what I would like be able to do    convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table. Now if you look at biology  there's many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you've heard about that are already nano structured. So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale. What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV  But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us  So here are some examples  these are some natural shells. There are natural biological materials. The abalone shell here    and if you fracture it  you can look at the fact that it's nano structured. There's diatoms made out of SIO   and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small  single domain magnets used for navigation. What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale  and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures. Now  going back to the abalone shell  the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins. These proteins are very negatively charged. And they can pull calcium out of the environment  put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate  calcium and carbonate. It has the chemical sequences of amino acids  which says   This is how to build the structure. Here's the DNA sequence  here's the protein sequence in order to do it.  And so an interesting idea is  what if you could take any material that you wanted  or any element on the periodic table  and find its corresponding DNA sequence  then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure  but not build an abalone shell    build something that  through nature  it has never had the opportunity to work with yet. And so here's the periodic table. And I absolutely love the periodic table. Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT  I have a periodic table made that says   Welcome to MIT. Now you're in your element.  And you flip it over  and it's the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges. And so I give this out to thousands of people. And I know it says MIT  and this is Caltech  but I have a couple extra if people want it. And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT  and I really wanted to give him a periodic table. So I stayed up at night  and I talked to my husband   How do I give President Obama a periodic table  What if he says  'Oh  I already have one ' or  'I've already memorized it'    Laughter  And so he came to visit my lab and looked around    it was a great visit. And then afterward  I said   Sir  I want to give you the periodic table in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight.  And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass. And so he looked at it  and he said   Thank you. I'll look at it periodically.  And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy  he pulled it out and said   And people at MIT  they give out periodic tables.  So basically what I didn't tell you is that about     million years ago  organisms starter making materials  but it took them about    million years to get good at it. It took them about    million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell. And that's a hard sell to a graduate student.  Laughter   I have this great project       million years.  And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly. And so we use a virus that's a non toxic virus called M   bacteriophage that's job is to infect bacteria. Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it. And by doing that  it allows the virus to express random protein sequences. And this is pretty easy biotechnology. And you could basically do this a billion times. And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical  but they differ from each other based on their tips  on one sequence that codes for one protein. Now if you take all billion viruses  and you can put them in one drop of liquid  you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table. And through a process of selection evolution  you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you'd like it to do  like grow a battery or grow a solar cell. So basically  viruses can't replicate themselves  they need a host. Once you find that one out of a billion  you infect it into a bacteria  and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence. And so the other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales. And these viruses are long and skinny  and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries. Now this is a high powered battery that we grew in my lab. We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes. So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube. The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery. And then it wires itself to the current collector. And so through a process of selection evolution  we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record breaking  high powered battery that's all made at room temperature  basically at the bench top. And that battery went to the White House for a press conference. I brought it here. You can see it in this case    that's lighting this LED. Now if we could scale this  you could actually use it to run your Prius  which is my dream    to be able to drive a virus powered car. But it's basically    you can pull one out of a billion. You can make lots of amplifications to it. Basically  you make an amplification in the lab  and then you get it to self assemble into a structure like a battery. We're able to do this also with catalysis. This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water. And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna  and you get an energy transfer across the virus. And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels. And I brought an example with me of that today. My students promised me it would work. These are virus assembled nanowires. When you shine light on them  you can see them bubbling. In this case  you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out. And basically  by controlling the genes  you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance. The last example are solar cells. You can also do this with solar cells. We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them    and use as a way of getting electrons through the device. And what we've found is through genetic engineering  we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye sensitized systems. And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward. So this is a virus based solar cell. Through evolution and selection  we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an    percent efficiency solar cell. So I hope that I've convinced you that there's a lot of great  interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials    and taking it the next step to see if you can force  or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials  to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making. Thank you. So for the past year and a half  my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature length interactive book. It's called  Our Choice  and the author is Al Gore. It's the sequel to  An Inconvenient Truth   and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis. The book starts like this. This is the cover. As the globe spins  we can see our location  and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book. Or  we can scroll through the pages at the bottom. And if we wanted to zoom into a page  we can just open it up. And anything you see in the book  you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up. And if you want to go back and read the book again  you just fold it back up and put it back on the page. And so this works the same way  you pick it up and pop it open. among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape. Mike Matas  And so throughout the whole book  Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos. This photo  you can you can even see on an interactive map. Zoom into it and see where it was taken. And throughout the book  there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations. So you can open this one. MM  It starts playing immediately. And while it's playing  we can pinch and peak back at the page  and the movie keeps playing. Or we can zoom out to the table of contents  and the video keeps playing. But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics. This one shows the wind potential all around the United States. But instead of just showing us the information  we can take our finger and explore  and see  state by state  exactly how much wind potential there is. We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power. This is one of my favorites. So this shows ... When the wind is blowing  any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery. And as the wind starts dying down  any excess energy will be diverted back into the house    the lights never go out. And this whole book  it doesn't just run on the iPad. It also runs on the iPhone. And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone. And it works the exact same way. You can pinch into any page. Open it up. So that's Push Pop Press' first title  Al Gore's  Our Choice.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  That's spectacular. Do you want to be a publisher  a technology licenser  What is the business here  Is this something that other people can do  MM  Yeah  we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content. So Melcher Media's team  who's on the East coast    and we're on the West coast  building the software    takes our tool and  every day  drags in images and text. CA  So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that   MM  Yes.  All right. Mike  thanks so much. MM  Thank you.  CA  Good luck.  My name is Arvind Gupta  and I'm a toymaker. I've been making toys for the last    years. The early '  s  I was in college. It was a very revolutionary time. It was a political ferment  so to say    students out in the streets of Paris  revolting against authority. America was jolted by the anti Vietnam movement  the Civil Rights movement. In India  we had the Naxalite movement  the  unclear  movement. But you know  when there is a political churning of society  it unleashes a lot of energy. The National Movement of India was testimony to that. Lots of people resigned from well paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement. Now in the early '  s  one of the great programs in India was to revitalize primary science in village schools. There was a person  Anil Sadgopal  did a Ph.D. from Caltech and returned back as a molecular biologist in India's cutting edge research institute  the TIFR. At     he was not able to relate the kind of  unclear  research  which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people. So he designed and went and started a village science program. Many people were inspired by this. The slogan of the early '  s was  Go to the people. Live with them  love them. Start from what they know. Build on what they have.  This was kind of the defining slogan. Well I took one year. I joined Telco  made TATA trucks  pretty close to Pune. I worked there for two years  and I realized that I was not born to make trucks. Often one doesn't know what one wants to do  but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do. So I took one year off  and I went to this village science program. And it was a turning point. It was a very small village    a weekly bazaar where people  just once in a week  they put in all the vats. So I said   I'm going to spend a year over here.  So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside. And one thing which I found was this black rubber. This is called a cycle valve tube. When you pump in air in a bicycle  you use a bit of this. And some of these models    so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube  you can put two matchsticks inside this  and you make a flexible joint. It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles    an acute angle  a right angle  an obtuse angle  a straight angle. It's like its own little coupling. If you have three of them  and you loop them together  well you make a triangle. With four  you make a square  you make a pentagon  you make a hexagon  you make all these kind of polygons. And they have some wonderful properties. If you look at the hexagon  for instance  it's like an amoeba  which is constantly changing its own profile. You can just pull this out  this becomes a rectangle. You give it a push  this becomes a parallelogram. But this is very shaky. Look at the pentagon  for instance  pull this out    it becomes a boat shape trapezium. Push it and it becomes house shaped. This becomes an isosceles triangle    again  very shaky. This square might look very square and prim. Give it a little push    this becomes a rhombus. It becomes kite shaped. But give a child a triangle  he can't do a thing to it. Why use triangles  Because triangles are the only rigid structures. We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come  it would start doing a jig. Ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in India  they might not have gone to engineering college  but no one makes a roof placed like this. Because if they put tiles on top  it's just going to crash. They always make a triangular roof. Now this is people science. And if you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick  you'll get a T joint. And if I were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle  I would make a tetrahedron. So you make all these  D shapes. You make a tetrahedron like this. And once you make these  you make a little house. Put this on top. You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six. You just need a ton. Now this was    you make a joint of six  you make an icosahedron. You can play around with it. This makes an igloo. Now this is in     . I was a    year old young engineer. And I thought this was so much better than making trucks. If you  as a matter of fact  put four marbles inside  you simulate the molecular structure of methane  CH . Four atoms of hydrogen  the four points of the tetrahedron  which means the little carbon atom. Well since then  I just thought that I've been really privileged to go to over       schools in my country    village schools  government schools  municipal schools  Ivy League schools    I've been invited by most of them. And every time I go to a school  I see a gleam in the eyes of the children. I see hope. I see happiness in their faces. Children want to make things. Children want to do things. Now this  we make lots and lots of pumps. Now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon. It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon. And we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it. So all you do is    it's a very kind of provocative statement    this old bicycle tube and this old plastic  unclear  This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube. And this is how you make a valve. You put a little sticky tape. This is one way traffic. Well we make lots and lots of pumps. And this is the other one    that you just take a straw  and you just put a stick inside and you make two half cuts. Now this is what you do  is you bend both these legs into a triangle  and you just wrap some tape around. And this is the pump. And now  if you have this pump  it's like a great  great sprinkler. It's like a centrifuge. If you spin something  it tends to fly out. Well in terms of    if you were in Andhra Pradesh  you would make this with the palmyra leaf. Many of our folk toys have great science principles. If you spin top something  it tends to fly out. If I do it with both hands  you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man. Right. This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing. There are four pictures. You see insects  you see frogs  snakes  eagles  butterflies  frogs  snakes  eagles. Here's a paper which you could  unclear     designed by a mathematician at Harvard in       Arthur Stone  documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books. But this is great fun for children. They all study about the food chain. The insects are eaten by the frogs  the frogs are eaten by the snakes  the snakes are eaten by the eagles. And this can be  if you had a whole photocopy paper    A  size paper    you could be in a municipal school  you could be in a government school    a paper  a scale and a pencil    no glue  no scissors. In three minutes  you just fold this up. And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination. If you take a smaller paper  you make a smaller flexagon. With a bigger one  you make a bigger one. Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here. And you put a little fan here. And this is a hundred year old toy. There have been six major research papers on this. There's some grooves over here  you can see. And if I take a reed    if I rub this  something very amazing happens. Six major research papers on this. As a matter of fact  Feynman  as a child  was very fascinated by this. He wrote a paper on this. And you don't need the three billion dollar Hadron Collider for doing this.  Laughter   Applause  This is there for every child  and every child can enjoy this. If you want to put a colored disk  well all these seven colors coalesce. And this is what Newton talked about     years back  that white light's made of seven colors  just by spinning this around. This is a straw. What we've done  we've just sealed both the ends with tape  nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner  so there's holes in the opposite corners  there's a little hole over here. This is a kind of a blowing straw. I just put this inside this. There's a hole here  and I shut this. And this costs very little money to make    great fun for children to do. What we do is make a very simple electric motor. Now this is the simplest motor on Earth. The most expensive thing is the battery inside this. If you have a battery  it costs five cents to make it. This is an old bicycle tube  which gives you a broad rubber band  two safety pins. This is a permanent magnet. Whenever current flows through the coil  this becomes an electromagnet. It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin. We made       . Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years  they just muck up the definition and they spit it out. When teachers make it  children make it. You can see a gleam in their eye. They get a thrill of what science is all about. And this science is not a rich man's game. In a democratic country  science must reach to our most oppressed  to the most marginalized children. This program started with    schools and spread to       government schools. Over         children learn science this way. And we're just trying to see possibilities. Look  this is the tetrapak    awful materials from the point of view of the environment. There are six layers    three layers of plastic  aluminum    which are are sealed together. They are fused together  so you can't separate them. Now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron. So something which is trash  which is choking all the seabirds  you could just recycle this into a very  very joyous    all the platonic solids can be made with things like this. This is a little straw  and what you do is you just nip two corners here  and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth. You put this in your mouth  and you blow. It's children's delight  a teacher's envy  as they say. You're not able to see how the sound is produced  because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth. I'm going to keep this outside  to blow out. I'm going to suck in air. So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations. The other is that you keep blowing at it  keep making the sound  and you keep cutting it. And something very  very nice happens. And when you get a very small one    This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this. Well before I go any further  this is something worth sharing. This is a touching slate meant for blind children. This is strips of Velcro  this is my drawing slate  and this is my drawing pen  which is basically a film box. It's basically like a fisherman's line  a fishing line. And this is wool over here. If I crank the handle  all the wool goes inside. And what a blind child can do is to just draw this. Wool sticks on Velcro. There are    million blind children in our country    who live in a world of darkness. And this has come as a great boon to them. There's a factory out there making our children blind  not able to provide them with food  not able to provide them with vitamin A. But this has come as a great boon for them. There are no patents. Anyone can make it. This is very  very simple. You can see  this is the generator. It's a crank generator. These are two magnets. This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs. Small pulley and two strong magnets. And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED. If I spin this pulley  the small one's going to spin much faster. There will be a spinning magnetic field. Lines  of course  would be cut  the force will be generated. And you can see  this LED is going to glow. So this is a small crank generator. Well  this is  again  it's just a ring  a steel ring with steel nuts. And what you can do is just  if you give it a twirl  well they just keep going on. And imagine a bunch of kids standing in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on. And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this. Well in the end  what we can also do  we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps. This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar. It's a great cricket cap.  Laughter   Applause  When first you see Nehru and Gandhi  this is the Nehru cap    just half a newspaper. We make lots of toys with newspapers  and this is one of them. And this is    you can see    this is a flapping bird. All of our old newspapers  we cut them into little squares. And if you have one of these birds    children in Japan have been making this bird for many  many years. And you can see  this is a little fantail bird. Well in the end  I'll just end with a story. This is called  The Captain's Hat Story.  The captain was a captain of a sea going ship. It goes very slowly. And there were lots of passengers on the ship  and they were getting bored  so the captain invited them on the deck.  Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance  and I'll provide you with good food and drinks.  And the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia. The first day  it was a huge umbrella cap  like a captain's cap. That night  when the passengers would be sleeping  he would give it one more fold  and the second day  he would be wearing a fireman's cap    with a little shoot just like a designer cap  because it protects the spinal cord. And the second night  he would take the same cap and give it another fold. And the third day  it would be a Shikari cap    just like an adventurer's cap. And the third night  he would give it two more folds    and this is a very  very famous cap. If you've seen any of our Bollywood films  this is what the policeman wears  it's called a zapalu cap. It's been catapulted to international glory. And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship. So that's a ship. And now the end  everyone was enjoying the journey very much. They were singing and dancing. Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves. And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves. A huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down. And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down. And there's a third one over here. This swallows the bridge and knocks it down. And the ship sinks  and the captain has lost everything  but for a life jacket. Thank you so much.
