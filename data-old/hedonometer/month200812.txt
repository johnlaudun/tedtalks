The north coast of California has rainforests    temperate rainforests    where it can rain more than     inches a year. This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree. Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens. Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth. The range of the species goes up to as much as     feet tall. That's    stories tall. These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan. Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any of them to count their annual growth rings  and  in any case  the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow. But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods are perhaps       years old    roughly the age of the Parthenon    although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees that are older than that. You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here  in red. The largest individuals of this species  the dreadnoughts of their kind  live just on the north coast of California  where the rain is really intense. In recent historic times  about    percent of the Coast Redwood forest was cut down  especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging  clear cutting that took place in the     s through the early     s. Even so  about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact  wild and now protected    entirely protected    in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of California  including Redwood National Park. But curiously  Redwood rainforests  the fragments that we have left  to this day remain under explored. Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through  and even today  individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before  including  in the summer of       Hyperion  the world's tallest tree. I'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment. I'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism. And  Chris  if I could have you up here  I have a tape measure. It's a kind loaner from TED. And Chris  if you could take the end of that tape measure  We're going to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big Redwood is. Unfortunately  this tape isn't long enough    it's only a    foot tape. Chris  could you extend your arm out that way  There we go. OK. And maybe about here  about    feet  is the diameter of a big Redwood. Now  let your imagination go upward into space. Think about this tree  rising upward into Redwood space      feet     stories  an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time. The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time  not human time  but what we might call Redwood time. Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time. To us  when we look at a Redwood tree  it seems to be motionless and still  and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion  moving upward into space  articulating themselves and filling Redwood space over Redwood time  over thousands of years. Plant this small seed  wait       years  and you get this  the Lost Monarch. It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast  and was discovered in     . And yet  when you look at the base of a Redwood tree  you're not seeing the organism. You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant  and most of the organism is overhead  unseen. I became very interested  and I wrote about a couple. Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers of the Redwood forest canopy. They're world class athletes  and they also are world class forest ecology scientists. Steve Sillett  when he was a    year old college student at Reed College  had heard that the Redwood forest canopy is considered to be a so called Redwood desert. That is to say  at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees. And with a friend of his  he took it upon himself to free climb a Redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there. He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood  and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands  and ended up hanging  like catching a bar of a trapeze. And then  from there  he climbed directly up the bark until he got to the top of the tree. His friend  a guy named Marwood Harris  was following behind. Neither one of them had noticed that there was a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into. And when Marwood made the jump  he was covered with wasps stinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go. He would have fallen to his death  being    feet above the ground. But they made it to the top  and what they found was not a Redwood desert  but a lost world    a kind of three dimensional labyrinth in the air  filled with unknown life. Now  I had been working on other topics  the emergence of infectious diseases  which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth  make a trans species jump  and get into humans. After three books on this  it got to be a bit much  in a way. My wife and I adore our children. And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them  using the so called arborist climbing technique  with ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree. Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees. That's my son  Oliver. They don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do. If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny  then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest. Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of that are afraid of heights. All other primates  when they're scared  they run up a tree  where they feel safe. We camped overnight in the trees  in tree boats. This is my daughter Laura  then     looking out of a tree boat. She's  by the way  tied in with a rope so she can't fall. Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us. We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels  who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are because they've never seen them in the canopy before. And we practiced advanced techniques like sky walking  where you can move from tree to tree through space  rather like Spiderman. It became a writing project. When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood  he fires an arrow  which trails a fishing line  which gets over a branch in the tree  and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line. You ascend    stories. There are two people climbing this tree  Gaya  which is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are. They are only one seventh of the way up that tree. You do feel a sense of exposure. There is a small person right down there on the ground. You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood. But then you enter the Redwood canopy  and it's like coming through a layer of clouds. And all of a sudden  you lose sight of the ground  and you also lose sight of the sky  and you're in a three dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil  which is populated with all kinds of small organisms. There are epiphytes  plants that grow on trees. These are huckleberry bushes. Many species of mosses  and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree. When you get near the top of the tree  you feel like you can't fall    in fact  it's difficult to move. You're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don't occur near the ground. It's like scuba diving into a coral reef  except you're going upward instead of downward. And then the trees tend to flare out into platform like areas at the top. Maria's sitting on one of them. These limbs could be five to six hundred years old. Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops. They also have a feature  thickets of huckleberry bushes that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees that are technically known as huckleberry afros  and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting. Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration. A Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs  the limbs burst into small trees  copies of the Redwood. Now  here we see a reiteration in Chronos  one of the older Redwoods. This reiteration is a huge flying buttress that comes out the tree itself. This buttress is less than halfway up the tree. And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods. This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base and extends upward for     feet. It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River  and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos. This three dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar  made by Steve Sillett  Marie Antoine and their colleagues  gives you an idea. What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal  of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks. I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale. There's the person  right there. The person is waving to us. I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to. And if we were able to reiterate  then the fingers of our hand would be people who looked like us  and they would have people on their hands and so on. And if we had Redwood like biology  we would have six layers of people on our hands  as it were. And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time. To reiterate the point  let's go closer into Iluvatar. We're looking at that yellow box. And this hallucinatory drawing shows you    everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar. These are millennial structures    portions of the tree that are believed to be more than       years old. There are four humans in this shot    one  two  three  four. And there's also something that I want to show you. This is a flying buttress. Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space  and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk  going back into the main trunk and fusing with it. Flying buttresses  just as in a cathedral  help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time. The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees. They've wired them like patients in an ICU. They're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks  possibly all the way into their root systems. They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself. If a portion of a Redwood is rotting  the Redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart. If we had Redwood like biology  if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just  you know  extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off. Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep  hundreds of feet above the ground  and there are organisms in this soil that have  as yet  no names. This is an unnamed species of copepod. A copepod is a crustacean. These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans  and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales. What they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean  or how they got there  is completely unknown. There are some interesting theories that  if I had time  I would tell you about. But as you go and you look closer at a tree  what you see is  you see increasing complexity. We're looking at the very top of Gaya  which is thought to be the oldest Redwood. Gaya may be       to       years old  no one really knows  but its top has broken off and it's been rotting back now. This little Japanese garden like creation probably took     years to form in its complexity that we see right now. As you look at a tree  it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree. I have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk. The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East. And we're moving in a full circle now. In the     s  a small organism appeared in Richmond  Virginia  called the Hemlock woolly adelgid. It made a trans species jump out of some other organism in Asia  where it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia. When it moved into its new host  the Eastern Hemlock tree  it escaped its predators  and the new tree had no resistance to it. The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River. I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east  but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park it can rain up to     inches of rain a year. And in the last two to three summers  these invasive organisms  this kind of Ebola of the trees  as it were  has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east  and has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer. This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park  and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see. And what we're seeing is not just the potential death of the Eastern Hemlock species    that is to say  its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite    but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns. It's absolutely heartbreaking to see. One of the things that is just    I almost can't conceive it    is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all  and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America. What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves  Well  I think they can tell us something about human time. The flickering  transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life    the necessity to love. But we're different from trees  and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have. We are human  and we have the capacity to love  we have the capacity to wonder  and we have a sort of boundless curiosity  a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates  I think. And at least for me  personally  the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children. Exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth. And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children I've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough  or possibly stupid enough  to still climb trees. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I think at a previous TED  I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like        years and older  on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the Earth except on that one tree. Is that correct  Richard Preston  Yes  that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion  the world's tallest tree. And I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it  in     . And while we were climbing Hyperion  Marie Antoine spotted an unknown species of golden brown ant about halfway up the trunk. Ants are not known to occur in Redwood trees  curiously enough  and we wondered whether this ant  this species of ant  was only endemic to that one tree  or possibly to that grove. And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again  and so no specimens have ever been collected. We don't know what it is    we just know it's there. CA  So  you have to wonder when  you know  if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth  you know  our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip. You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening  and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever. It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me  and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is. RP  It is fragile  and you know  I think about emerging human diseases    parasites that move into the human species. But that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide  all through the ecosystems  and you know  the Earth itself    CA  Partly caused by us  inadvertently. RP  Caused by humans. Caused by the movement of humans. You can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace  and the continents are rooms in the palace  and the islands are small rooms. But lately  the doors of the palace have been flung open  and the walls are coming down. CA  Richard Preston  thank you very much  I think. RP  Thank you. You know  we're going to do things a little differently. I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you. And at the same time  we're going to look at just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that    snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating. You can    I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there. I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this  and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask questions. You know  I guess the first question is  why build a virtual world at all  And I think the answer to that is always going to be at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project  you know. So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a    really going back as far as a teenager and then an adult  to actually try and build this kind of thing. I was a very creative kid who read a lot  and got into electronics first  and then later  programming computers  when I was really young. I was just always trying to make things. I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things  and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else. And so  for example    and it's a great Second Life thing    I had a bedroom. And every kid  you know  as a teenager  has got his bedroom he retreats to    but I wanted my door  I thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened  like on Star Trek. I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling and I cut through the ceiling joists  much to my parents' delight  and put the door  you know  being pulled up through the ceiling. I built    I put a garage door opener up in the attic that would pull this door up. You can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents. The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do  but are so often unable  in the real world  to actually do those things    to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective. And so for me  I know that when the Internet came around and I was doing computer programming and just  you know  just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers  I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers would be to use the Internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together    the sort of    the idea of atoms and how to make things  and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff. And so for me that was the thing that was so enticing. I just wanted this place where you could build things. And so I think you see that in the genesis of what has happened with Second Life  and I think it's important. I also think that more generally  the use of the Internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend. It is a    sort of a great human progress. Technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible. And I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally represent the best we can do to achieve that right now. You know  another way to look at that  and related to the content and  you know  thinking about space  is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space. I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second. If you think about going into space  it's a fascinating thing. So many movies  so many kids  we all sort of dream about exploring space. Now  why is that  Stop for a moment and ask  why that conceit  Why do we as people want to do that  I think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies    you know  it's this dream that we all share. One is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again. In some sense  you would become someone else in that journey  because there wouldn't be    you'd leave society and life as you know it  behind. And so inevitably  you would transform yourself    irreversibly  in all likelihood    as you began this exploration. And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense that if you travel far enough  you can find out there    oh  yeah    you have no idea what you're going to find once you get there  into space. It's going to be different than here. And in fact  it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible. So that's kind of the idea    we as humans crave the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible. And I think that if you really sit and think about it  virtual worlds  and where we're going with more and more computing technology  represent essentially the likely  really tactically possible version of space exploration. We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because  like space  they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything and everything  and probably anything could happen there. You know  to give you a size idea about scale  you know  comparing space to Second Life  most people don't realize  kind of    and then this is just like the Internet in the early '  s. In fact  Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '  s today  everybody's very excited  there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next from moment to moment  and then there's despair and everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work. Everything that's happening with Second Life and more broadly with virtual worlds  all happened in the early '  s. We always play a game at the office where you can take any article and find the same article where you just replace the words  Second Life  with  Web   and  virtual reality  with  Internet.  You can find exactly the same articles written about everything that people are observing. To give you an idea of scale  Second Life is about        CPUs at this point. It's about        computers connected together in three facilities in the United States right now  that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself    there's about         people a day that are wandering around in there  so the kind of  active population is something like a smallish city. The space itself is about    times the size of San Francisco  and it's about as densely built out. So it gives you an idea of scale. Now  it's expanding very rapidly    about five percent a month or so right now  in terms of new servers being added. And so of course  radically unlike the real world  and like the Internet  the whole thing is expanding very  very quickly  and historically exponentially. So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that's in there  and I think that amount is critical. It was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility. We're very sensitive to that as humans. You know  you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can't. Second Life today is this        machines  and it's about     million or so user created objects where  you know  an object would be something like this  possibly interactive. Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time  they have code attached to them. So it's a really large world already  in terms of the amount of stuff that's there and that's very important. If anybody plays  like  World of Warcraft  World of Warcraft comes on  like  four DVDs. Second Life  by comparison  has about     terabytes of user created data  making it about        times larger. So again  like the Internet compared to AOL  and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time  what's happening here is something very different  because the sheer scale of what people can do when they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing. The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true that whatever this is going to evolve into is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself. And let me justify that with two statements. Generically  what we use the Web for is to organize  exchange  create and consume information. It's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data driven. I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information. Everything that we interact with  all the experiences that we have  is kind of us flowing through a sea of information and interacting with it in different ways. The Web puts information in the form of text and images. The topology  the geography of the Web is text to text links for the most part. That's one way of organizing information  but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that I think are the important ways that they're very different and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web. The first is that  as I said  the    well  the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual world using the most powerful iconic symbols that you can possibly use with human beings. So for example  C H A I R is the English word for that  but a picture of this is a universal symbol. Everybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it. It's also more memorable if I show you that picture  and I show you C H A I R on a piece of paper. You can do tests that show that you'll remember that I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better. So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory  using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives  you maximally both excite  stimulate  are able to remember  transfer and manipulate data. And so virtual worlds are the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information. And I think that's something that people have talked about for    years    you know  that  D  that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us. But the second thing    and I think this one is less obvious    is that the experience of creating  consuming  exploring that information is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social. You are always there with other people. And we as humans are social creatures and must  or are aided by  or enjoy more  the consumption of information in the presence of others. It's essential to us. You can't escape it. When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever  you're on there right now  when you're on the site  with like       other people  but you can't talk to them. You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras on the same page as you  and ask them   Hey  have you seen one of these before  Because I'm thinking about buying it.  That experience of like  shopping together  just as a simple example  is an example of how as social creatures we want to experience information in that way. So that second point  that we inherently experience information together or want to experience it together  is critical to essentially  kind of  this trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us. And so I think  again  that it's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet  if you will  to be together  to consume information. You know  mapping in India    that's such a great example. Maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time. Asking for advice  rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map. So I think that's another big point. I think that wherever this is all going  whether it's Second Life or its descendants  or something broader that happens all around the world at a lot of different points    this is what we're going to see the Internet used for  and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert  so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern  but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment. Big idea  but I think highly defensible. So let me stop there and bring John back  and maybe we can just have a longer conversation. Thank you. John. That's great. John Hockenberry  Why is the creation  the impulse to create Second Life  not a utopian impulse  Like for example  in the   th century  any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds were explicitly utopian. Philip Rosedale  I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah. Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia  would be one way I'd say it. The answer is no  and I think the reason why is because the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms up. That idea of infinite possibility  that magic of anything can happen  only happens in an environment where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor  at the level of the Lego blocks  if you will  that make up the virtual world. You have to have that level of freedom  and so I'm often asked that  you know  is there a  kind of  utopian or  is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it  that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it  Those top down schemes are alienating to just about everybody  even if you mean well when you build them. And what's more  human society  when it's controlled  when you set out a grand scheme of rules  a new way of people interacting  or a new way of laying out a city  or whatever  that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond  you know    I always laughingly say    the Mall of America  you know  which is like  the largest piece of centrally designed architecture that  you know  has been built. JH  The Kremlin was pretty big. PR  The Kremlin  yeah. That's true. The whole complex. JH  Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning in Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use in the creation of their avatars or in communicating that people actually in practice said  no  I'm not interested in that at all  and name something that you didn't come up with that almost immediately people began to demand. PR  I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those. One of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life    I was really passionate about it. It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody and have a more private conversation  but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody. It was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat. I just remember it was one of those examples of data driven design. I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective  and it was just absolutely never used  and we ultimately    I think we've now turned it off  if I remember. We finally gave up  took it out of the code. But more generally  you know  one other example I think about this  which is great relative to the utopian idea. Second Life originally had    simulators. It now has       . So when it only had     it was only about as big as this college campus. And we had    we zoned it  you know  we put a nightclub  we put a disco where you could dance  and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to  and we had another place that was like a boardwalk  kind of a Coney Island. And we laid out the zoning  but of course  people could build all around it however they wanted to. And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept  basically  was instantly and thoroughly ignored  and like  two months into the whole thing     which is really a small amount of time  even in Second Life time    I remember the users  the people who were then using Second Life  the residents came to me and said  we want to buy the disco    because I had built it    we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it. And I sold it to them    I mean  we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building. And I remember that that was just so telling  you know  that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen. When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular    JH  CBGB's has to close eventually  you know. That's the rule. PR  Exactly. And it    but it closed on day one  basically  in Internet time. You know  an example of something    pregnancy. You can have a baby in Second Life. This is done entirely using  kind of  the tools that are built into Second Life  so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby  of course    Second Life is  at the platform level  at the level of the company    at Linden Lab    Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever. There is no attempt to structure the experience  to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it. So of course  we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or  you know  taking two avatars and merging them  or something. But people built the ability to have babies and care for babies as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so    I mean  that's a pretty fascinating example of  you know  what goes on in the overall economy. And of course  the existence of an economy is another idea. I didn't talk about it  but it's a critical feature. When people are given the opportunity to create in the world  there's really two things they want. One is fair ownership of the things they create. And then the second one is    if they feel like it  and they're not going to do it in every case  but in many they are    they want to actually be able to sell that creation as a way of providing for their own livelihood. True on the Web    also true in Second Life. And so the existence of an economy is critical. JH  Questions for Philip Rosedale  Right here. JH  The observation is  Philip has been accused of looking like a character  an avatar  in Second Life. Respond  and then we'll get the rest of your question. PR  But I don't look like my avatar. How many people here know what my avatar looks like  That's probably not very many. JH  Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that  sort of    PR  No  no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar    a female avatar    that I used to be once in a while. But my avatar is a guy wearing chaps. Spiky hair    spikier than this. Kind of orange hair. Handlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character. So  very cool. JH  And your question  JH  The question is  there appears to be a lack of cultural fine tuning in Second Life. It doesn't seem to have its own culture  and the sort of differences that exist in the real world aren't translated into the Second Life map. PR  Well  first of all  we're very early  so this has only been going on for a few years. And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies. So a fair criticism    is what it is    of Second Life today is that it's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome  from a cultural standpoint. That said  the evolution of  and the nuanced interaction that creates culture  is happening at    times the speed of the real world  and in an environment where  if you walk into a bar in Second Life     percent of the people there are not in the United States  and in fact are speaking their  you know  various and different languages. In fact  one of the ways to make money in Second Life is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body and they basically  kind of  pop up on your screen and allow you to use Google or Babel Fish or one of the other online text translators to on the fly translate spoken    I'm sorry    typed text between individuals. And so  the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside Second Life is quite    I think  quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve. So  I think that culture will fine tune  it will emerge  but we still have some years to wait while that happens  as you would naturally expect. JH  Other questions  Right here. JH  What's your demographic  PR  So  the question is  what's the demographic. So  the average age of a person in Second Life is     however  the use of Second Life increases dramatically as your physical age increases. So as you go from age    to age       and there are many people in their sixties using Second Life    this is also not a sharp curve    it's very  very distributed    usage goes up in terms of  like  hours per week by    percent as you go from age    to age    in real life  so there's not    many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life is some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing    I'm just speaking broadly and critically    it's not very appealing to people that play online video games  because the graphics are not yet equivalent to    I mean  these are very nice pictures  but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto  . So average age    . I mentioned    percent of the users are not in the United States. The distribution amongst countries is extremely broad. There's users from  you know  virtually every country in the world now in Second Life. The dominant ones are    if you take the UK and Europe  together they make up about    percent of the usage base in Second Life. In terms of psychographic    oh  men and women  men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life  so about    percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women. Women use Second Life  though  about    to    percent more  on an hours basis  than men do  meaning that more men sign up than women  and more women stay and use it than men. So that's another demographic fact. In terms of psychographic  you know  the people in Second Life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think  when you go in and talk to them and meet them  and I would  you know  challenge you to just do this and find out. But it's not a bunch of programmers. It's not easy to describe as a demographic. If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture  I'd say  remember the people who were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay  Maybe a little bit like that  in other words  people who are early adopters. They tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial. A lot of them    about        people so far    are cash flow positive  they're making money from what    I mean  real world money    from what they're doing in Second Life  so it's a very build    still a creative  building things  build your own business type of an orientation. So  that's it. JH  You describe yourself  Philip  as someone who was really creative when you were young and  you know  liked to make things. I mean  it's not often that you hear somebody describe themselves as really creative. I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student who spent a lot of time in his room  Is it possible  PR  I was a    there were times I was a C student. You know  it's funny. When I got to college    I studied physics in college    and I got really    it was funny  because I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time. I was shy. I don't seem like it now  but I was very shy. Moved around a bunch    had that experience too. So I did  kind of  I think  live in my own world  and obviously that helps  you know  engage your real interest in something. JH  So you're on your fifth life at this point  PR  If you count  yeah  cities. So    but I did    and I didn't do    I think I didn't do as well in school as I could have. I think you're right. I wasn't  like  an obsessed    you know  get A's kind of guy. I was going to say  I had a great social experience when I went to college that I hadn't had before  a more fraternal experience  where I met six or seven other guys who I studied physics with  and I was very competitive with them  so then I started to get A's. But you're right  I wasn't an A student. JH  Last question. Right here. JH  You want to paraphrase that  PR  Yeah  so let me restate that. So  you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones    our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities    and that in fact  much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm. And then that's kind of a horrifying thought  of course. That's a frightening change  frightening disruption. I guess  and you're asking  what do I think about that  How do I    JH  What's your response to the people who would say  that's horrifying  what would be your response   PR  Well  I'd say a couple of things. One is  it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was. That is to say  it's a big change  but it isn't avoidable. So  no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes from connecting us together  because the basic motive that people have    to be creative and entrepreneurial    is going to drive energy into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web. So this change  I believe  is a huge disruptive change. Obviously  I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here  but I think that as    even a sober  you know  the most sober  disconnected thinker about this  looking at it from the side  has to conclude  based on the data  that with those kinds of economic forces at play  there is definitely going to be a sea change  and that change is going to be intensely disruptive relative to our concept of our very lives and being  and our identities  as well. I don't think we can get away from those changes. I think generally  we were talking about this    I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it  being    surviving there  having a good life there  so to speak  is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it  because of the languages  because of the entrepreneurial richness of it  the sort of flea market nature  if you will  of the virtual world today. It puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves  in many ways. We must learn things and  you know  be more tolerant  and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative  perhaps  than we are typically in our real lives. And I think that if that is true of virtual worlds  then these changes  though scary    and  I say  inevitable    are ultimately for the better  and therefore something that we should ride out. But I would say that    and many other authors and speakers about this  other than me  have said  you know  fasten your seat belts because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes. JH  Philip Rosedale  thank you very much. People love their automobiles. They allow us to go where we want to when we want to. They're a form of entertainment  they're a form of art  a pride of ownership. Songs are written about cars. Prince wrote a great song   Little Red Corvette.  He didn't write  Little Red Laptop Computer  or  Little Red Dirt Devil.  He wrote about a car. And one of my favorites has always been   Make love to your man in a Chevy van   because that was my vehicle when I was in college. The fact is  when we do our market research around the world  we see that there's nearly a universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile. And     million people in the world today own a car. And you say  boy  that's a lot. But you know what  That's just    percent of the population. We really have to ask the question  Can the world sustain that number of automobiles  And if you look at projections over the next    to    to    years  it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of  .  billion vehicles. Now  if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the Earth  that would stretch around the Earth     times. Now  we've made great progress with automobile technology over the last     years. Cars are dramatically cleaner  dramatically safer  more efficient and radically more affordable than they were     years ago. But the fact remains  the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same. If we are going to reinvent the automobile today  rather than     years ago  knowing what we know about the issues associated with our product and about the technologies that exist today  what would we do  We wanted something that was really affordable. The fuel cell looked great  one tenth as many moving parts and a fuel cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine    and it emits just water. And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law with electronic controls and software  and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected. So we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine  the fuel cell  hydrogen as the energy carrier. First was Autonomy. Autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head. We embodied all of the key components of a fuel cell propulsion system. We then had Autonomy drivable with Hy Wire  and we showed Hy Wire here at this conference last year. Hy Wire is the world's first drivable fuel cell  and we have followed up that now with Sequel. And Sequel truly is a real car. So if we would run the video    But the real key question I'm sure that's on your mind  where's the hydrogen going to come from  And secondly  when are these kinds of cars going to be available  So let me talk about hydrogen first. The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources  it can come from fossil fuels  it can come from any way that you can create electricity  including renewables. And it can come from biofuels. And that's quite exciting. The vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen. A lot of hydrogen's produced today in the world. It's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline    which I find is somewhat ironic. It's produced in the fertilizer industry  it's produced in the chemical manufacturing industry. That hydrogen's being made because there's a good business reason for its use. But it tells us that we know how to create it  we know how to create it cost effectively  we know how to handle it safely. We did an analysis where you would have a station in each city with each of the     largest cities in the United States  and located the stations so you'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time. We put one every    miles on the freeway  and it turns out that translates into about        stations. And at a million dollars each  that would be about    billion dollars. Now that's a lot of money. But if you built the Alaskan pipeline today  that's half of what the Alaskan pipeline would cost. But the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling  much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cellphone. So we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen. We think it's a question of not whether  but a question of when. What we've targeted for ourselves    and we're making great progress for this goal    is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells  designed and validated  that can go head to head with the internal combustion engine    we're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine    and do it in terms of its affordability  add skill volumes  its performance and its durability. So that's what we're driving to for     . We haven't seen anything yet in our development work that says that isn't possible. We actually think the future's going to be event driven. So since we can't predict the future  we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future. I'm very  very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle    percent of the time  they're parked  they're parked all around us. They're usually parked within     feet of the people that own them. Now  if you take the power generating capability of an automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States  it turns out that four percent of the automobiles  the power in four percent of the automobiles  equals that of the electric grid of the US. that's a huge power generating capability  a mobile power generating capability. And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid. And we talked about swarm networks earlier. And talking about the ultimate swarm  about having all of the processors and all of the cars when they're sitting idle being part of a global grid for computing capability. We find that premise quite exciting. The automobile becomes  then  an appliance  not in a commodity sense  but an appliance  mobile power  mobile platform for information and computing and communication  as well as a form of transportation. And the key to all of this is to make it affordable  to make it exciting  to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it. And again  this is a pretty big march to take here. And a lot of people say  how do you sleep at night when you're rustling with a problem of that magnitude  And I tell them I sleep like a baby  I wake up crying every two hours. Actually the theme of this conference  I think  has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off    and that's relationships and working together. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Larry  Larry  wait  wait  wait  wait  Larry  wait  wait one sec. Just    I've got so many questions I could ask you. I just want to ask one. You know  I could be wrong about this  but my sense is that in the public mind  today  that GM is not viewed as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your Japanese competitors  maybe even as Ford. Are you serious about it  and not just  you know  when the consumers want it  when the regulators force us to do it we will go there  Are you guys going to really try and show leadership on this  Larry Burns  Yeah  we're absolutely serious. We're into this over a billion dollars already  so I would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money. And secondly  it's a fundamental business proposition. I'll be honest with you  we're into it because of business growth opportunities. We can't grow our business unless we solve these problems. The growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don't solve the problems. And there's a simple principle of strategy that says  Do unto yourself before others do unto you. If we can see this possible future  others can too. And we want to be the first one to create it  Chris. In       Buckminster Fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope. It was a     foot diameter geodesic sphere to be suspended over the East River in New York City  in full view of the United Nations. It was a big idea  for sure  and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data  trends and other information regarding the globe  on this sphere. And today     years later  we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective  but what we do have is improved technology. Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display. We can use LEDs. LEDs are smaller  they're cheaper  they're longer lasting  they're more efficient. Most importantly for this  they're faster. And this speed  combined with today's high performance micro controllers  allows us to actually simulate  in this piece  over        LEDs    using just   . And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision. But as this ring rotates at about       rpm    that's    times per second. The equator's speed is actually about    miles per hour. There are four on board micro controllers that  each time this ring rotates it  as it passes the rear of the display  it picks up a position signal. And from that  the on board micro controllers can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations. But this is really just the beginning. In addition to higher resolution versions of this display  my father and I are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon. It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes. So as you can see here  this is a  eleven inch diameter circuit board. These blocks represent LEDs. And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis  it will create a disc of light that we can control. That's nothing new  that's a propeller clock  that's the rims that you can buy for your car. But what is new is that  when we rotate this disc about this axis  this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light. And so we can control that with micro controllers and create a fully volumetric  three dimensional display with just     LEDs. Now this piece is currently in process    due out in May    but what we've done is we've put together a small demo  just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere. I've got a little video to show you  but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control  and this is also with only four LEDs. This is actually only about  .  percent of what the final display will be in May. So  take a look. And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only  creating circles. And then  as the other axis kicks in  those actually blur into a volume. And the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case. But this piece is due out in May. It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show in Greenwich Village in New York City    that's open to the public  definitely invite you all to come and attend    it's a fantastic show. There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects. This piece  actually  will be on display down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show. So I'd love to talk to you all  and invite you to come down and take a closer look. It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much. This is Aunt Zip from Sodom  North Carolina. She was     years old when I took this picture. She was always saying things that made me stop and think  like   Time may be a great healer  but it ain't no beauty specialist.  She said   Be good to your friends. Why  without them  you'd be a total stranger.  This is one of her songs. Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together. And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me. Give him a big old hand. One  two  three  four. Well  my true love's a black eyed daisy  if I don't see her  I go crazy. My true love lives up the river  a few more jumps and I'll be with her. Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey black eyed Susie  hey. Now you've got to picture Aunt Zip at     years old in Sodom  North Carolina. I'd go up and learn these old songs from her. She couldn't sing much  couldn't play anymore. And I'd pull her out on the front porch. Down below  there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule. A double outhouse over here on the side. And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy  so I'd sing   Hey  hey   and she'd just answer back with   Black eyed Susie.  Oh  hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  hey. Well  she and I went blackberry picking. She got mad  I took a licking. Ducks on the millpond  geese in the ocean  Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion. Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey black eyed Susie  hey. Let's have the banjo. Well  we'll get married next Thanksgiving. I'll lay around  she'll make a living. She'll cook blackjacks  I'll cook gravy  we'll have chicken someday  maybe. Hey  hey  hey  hey. Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  hey  One more time now. Oh  hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  Hey  hey  black eyed Susie  hey. Thank you  Michael. This is Ralph Stanley. When I was going to college at University of California at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies  taking majors in biology and art  he came to the campus. This was in       I guess it was. And he played his bluegrass style of music  but near the end of the concert  he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from Africa  along with the banjo. It's called claw hammer style  that he had learned from his mother and grandmother. I fell in love with that. I went up to him and said  how can I learn that  He said  well  you can go back to Clinch Mountain  where I'm from  or Asheville or Mount Airy  North Carolina    some place that has a lot of music. Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style. So I went back that very summer. I just fell in love with the culture and the people. And you know  I came back to school  I finished my degrees and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player. You can imagine how excited they were. So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures I've taken of some of my mentors. Just a few of them  but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks. And play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley. Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks  who just passed away last year. He was one of the great American folk tale tellers. The Old Jack tales that he had learned    he talked like this  you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful. And he lived in that house that his great grandfather had built. No running water  no electricity. A wonderful  wonderful guy. And you can look at more pictures. I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you. This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow. It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world  and still played in the Southern mountains. Now  the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this. They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up. It was hard on the cats  but it made a great little instrument. It sounds something like this. Well  have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys  You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. Now  they were scouts in the rebels' army  they were known both far and wide. When the Yankees saw them coming  they'd lay down their guns and hide. You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. You take Kate  I'll take Sal  we'll both have a Johnson gal. Ain't that a sound  Well  it was       I guess it was. We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville  Texas  where I grew up in the early part of my life. Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store. My mom was driving  my brother and I were in the back seat. We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window. We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields. You see  we'd just been to the grocery store  and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it. And  buddy  that made us mad. Well  my mom didn't put up with much either  and she was driving  and she said   You boys  You think you can have anything you want. You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard. You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives. You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer.  She pulled the car over  she said   Get out of the car.  My brother and I stepped out of the car. We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton. There were about a hundred black folks out there picking. My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field. She went up to the foreman  she said   I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives.  Of course  we were just eight and   . She said   Would you put them to work   Well  that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman  put these two middle class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas    it's hot. So he gave us each a cotton sack  about    feet long  about that big around  and we started picking. Now  cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers. And if you don't know what you're doing  your hands are bleeding in no time. And my brother and I started to pick it  and our hands were startin' to bleed  and then     Mom   And Mom was just sitting by the car like this. She wasn't going to give up. Well  the foreman could see he was in over his head  I guess. He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice. He just sang   Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind.  And from all around as people started singing and answering back  he sang   Good news  good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind.  Now  my brother and I had never heard anything like that in our whole lives. It was so beautiful. We sat there all day picking cotton  without complaining  without crying  while they sang things like   Oh  Mary  don't you weep  don't you moan  and  Wade in the water   and  I done done    This little light of mine.  Finally  by the end of the day  we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton. But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar  but my mother would never let us cash it. I'm     still have the check. Now  my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work. But if you have children  you know it doesn't often work that way. No  we learned something else. The first thing I learned that day was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again. And pretty much never did. But I also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day  and that was an eye opener. And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier. And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can. Now  I was just a little eight year old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field. I wasn't even aware of music    not even aware of it. But that day in the cotton field out there picking  when those people started singing  I realized I was in the very heart of real music  and that's where I've wanted to be ever since. Try this old song with me. I sing  Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. You sing  Don't want it to leave me behind. Well  there's a long white robe in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Good news  good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me    It's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton  isn't it  Let's try it one more time. There's a starry crown in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. There's a starry crown in heaven  I know. Don't want it to leave me behind. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind. It was a few years ago  but I sort of remembered this story  and I told it at a concert. My mom was in the audience. After the    she was glad to have a story about herself  of course  but after the concert she came up and she said   David  I've got to tell you something. I set that whole thing up. I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land. I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work. I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though.  Let's try. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. Good news  Chariot's coming. And I don't want it to leave me behind. Well  this is the steel guitar. It's an American made instrument. It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers  who later on made the Dobro  which is a wood bodied instrument with a metal cone for    where the sound comes from. It's usually played flat on your lap. It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the     s  before they had electric guitars  trying to make a loud guitar. And then African American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck  just like that    a nice Merlot works very well. That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect. Break it off  put it on your finger  and slide into the notes. This instrument pretty much saved my life. Fifteen years ago     years ago  I guess  this year  my wife and I lost our daughter  Sarah Jane  in a car accident  and it was the most    it almost took me out    it almost took me out of this world. And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief  just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in. I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive. I had to sit down and make lists  because I was ready to go  I was ready to check out of this world. And you know  at the top of the list  of course  were Jenny  and my son  Zeb  my parents    I didn't want to hurt them. But then  when I thought about it beyond that  it was very simple things. I didn't care about    I had a radio show  I have a radio show on public radio   Riverwalk   I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything. Nothing. Nothing. On the list it would be stuff like  seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring  the smell of new mown hay  catching a wave and bodysurfing  the touch of a baby's hand  the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar  listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon. And for me  the sound of a steel guitar  because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things. And I would sit around with it  and I didn't know how to play it  but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play. And it was the only instrument that  of all the ones that I play  that would really make that connection. This is a song that came out of that. Well  I hear you're having trouble. Lord  I hate to hear that news. If you want to talk about it  you know  I will listen to you through. Words no longer say it  let me tell you what I always do. I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues. People say   Oh  snap out of it   Oh yeah  that's easier said than done. While you can hardly move  they're running around having all kinds of fun. Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood 'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues. Now  you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes  but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get. But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose. Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues. Open up now. Oh  I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor. We moved to California when Sputnik went up  in     . And he was working on gyroscopes  he has a number of patents for that kind of thing. And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney. They were about my age. John went on  and Michael did too  to become some of the inventors of computer animation. Michael's dad was working on something called the computer. This was       I was a little    year old kid  I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one  you know  what they were making. It was like a library  just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see  just floors and floors of these things  and one of the engineers said  some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket. I thought  damn  those are going to be some big pants  So that Christmas    maybe I've got time for this    that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun o Rama chemistry set. Well  I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad  so did Michael. His great granddad had been Eli Whitney  the inventor of the cotton gin. So we looked in that    this was a commercial chemistry set. It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see  sulfur  potassium nitrate and charcoal. Man  we were only     but we knew that made gunpowder. We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew  it flared up. Ah  it was great. Well  obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon. So we went over into Michael's garage    his dad had all kinds of stuff  and we put a pipe in the vice there  and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe  drilled a hole in the back of the pipe  took some of our firecrackers  pulled out the fuses  tied them together  put them in the back there  and    down in that hole    and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top  in the garage. We weren't stupid  we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it. We stood back  we lit that thing  and they flew out of there    they went through that plywood like it was paper. Through the garage. Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen. We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard. That was Pacific Palisades  it probably is still there  back there. Well  my brother heard that we had made gunpowder. He and his buddies  they were older  and they were pretty mean. They said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them. We said  well  what are you going to do with it  They said  we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel. Sure. We'll make you a big batch. So we made them a big batch  and it was in my    now  we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California. Mom had redone the kitchen  Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin. It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down. Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen. He said   Yeah  hey  it's melting. Yeah  the sulfur's melting. No problem. Yeah  you know.  It just flared up  and he turned around  and he looked like this. No hair  no eyelashes  no nothing. There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet  the air was the just full of black smoke. She came home  she took that chemistry set away  and we never saw it again. But we thought of it often  because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made    tasted faintly of gunpowder. So I like to invent things too  and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back. When drum machines were new  I got to thinking  why couldn't you take the oldest form of music  the hambone rhythms  and combine it with the newest technology  I call this Thunderwear. At that time  drum triggers were new. And so I put them all together and sewed    of them in this suit. I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday  I'm going to be doing some of the same ones. I have a trigger here  trigger here  here  here. Right there. It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay. Now  the drum triggers go out my tail here  into the drum machine  and they can make various sounds  like drums. So let me put them all together. And also  I can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here  and    let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this. Thank you  folks. So I understand that this meeting was planned  and the slogan was From Was to Still. And I am illustrating Still. Which  of course  I am not agreeing with because  although I am     I am not still working. And anybody who asks me   Are you still doing this or that   I don't answer because I'm not doing things still  I'm doing it like I always did. I still have    or did I use the word still  I didn't mean that. I have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans. I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did. So this takes care of my age. I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here. This was about     . All of these things were made during the last    years. But  of course  I'm working since     doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China. This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum. This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale. This is a portrait of my daughter and myself. These were just some of the things I've made. I made hundreds of them for the last    years. I call myself a maker of things. I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things. Industrial designers want to make novel things. Novelty is a concept of commerce  not an aesthetic concept. The industrial design magazine  I believe  is called  Innovation.  Innovation is not part of the aim of my work. Well  makers of things  they make things more beautiful  more elegant  more comfortable than just the craftsmen do. I have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say. Well  to describe our profession otherwise  we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty. That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man. Sarah Smith  who was a mathematics professor at MIT  wrote   The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity    that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty.  These are tiles. The word   playful  is a necessary aspect of our work because  actually  one of our problems is that we have to make  produce  lovely things throughout all of life  and this for me is now    years. So how can you  without drying up  make things with the same pleasure  as a gift to others  for so long  The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer. Let me tell you some about my life. As I said  I started to do these things    years ago. My first exhibition in the United States was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in         that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand drawn pieces as part of the exhibit. My work actually took me through many countries  and showed me a great part of the world. This is not that they took me    the work didn't take me    I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world. I was incredibly curious to see the world  and I made all these things  which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures. I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman  and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages. The guild system  that means when I was an apprentice  I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master. In my shop where I studied  or learned  there was a traditional hierarchy of master  journeyman and learned worker  and apprentice  and I worked as the apprentice. The work as an apprentice was very primitive. That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand. We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside. After that  it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in  kind of  a mangle. And then finally it was prepared for the throwing. And there I really worked as an apprentice. My master took me to set ovens because this was part of oven making  oven setting  in the time. And finally  I had received a document that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully  that I had behaved morally  and this document was given to me by the Guild of Roof Coverers  Rail Diggers  Oven Setters  Chimney Sweeps and Potters. I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions  and I still have that workbook. First I set up a shop in my own garden  and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest. And there I was sitting  and my then boyfriend    I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today    but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots. My mother thought that this was not very proper  so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity. However  after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest  a pottery factory  a large one. And I visited it with several ladies  and asked all sorts of questions of the director. Then the director asked me  why do you ask all these questions  I said  I also have a pottery. So he asked me  could he please visit me  and then finally he did  and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism  that the industrial revolution had broken out  and that I rather should join the factory. There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months. However  everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department. The director there said there were several women casting and producing my designs now in molds  and this was sold also to America. I remember that it was quite successful. However  the director  the chemist  model maker    everybody    concerned himself much more with the art department    that means  with my work    than making toilets  so finally they got a letter from the center  from the bank who owned the factory  saying  make toilet setting behind the art department  and that was my end. So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman  and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world. So as a journeyman  I put an ad into the paper that I had studied  that I was a down to earth potter's journeyman and I was looking for a job as a journeyman. And I got several answers  and I accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically  I thought  halfway to America. And that was in Hamburg. Then I first took this job in Hamburg  at an art pottery where everything was done on the wheel  and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters. And the first day  I was coming to take my place at the turntable    there were three or four turntables    and one of them  behind where I was sitting  was a hunchback  a deaf mute hunchback  who smelled very bad. So I doused him in cologne every day  which he thought was very nice  and therefore he brought bread and butter every day  which I had to eat out of courtesy. The first day I came to work in this shop there was on my wheel a surprise for me. My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work a very nicely modeled natural man's organs. After I brushed them off with a hand motion  they were very    I finally was now accepted  and worked there for some six months. This was my first job. If I go on like this  you will be here till midnight. So I will try speed it up a little Moderator  Eva  we have about five minutes. Eva Zeisel  Are you sure  Moderator  Yes  I am sure. EZ  Well  if you are sure  I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast. And actually  my work took me to many countries because I used my work to fill my curiosity. And among other things  other countries I worked  was in the Soviet Union  where I worked from '   to '      actually  to '  . I was finally there  although I had nothing to do    I was a foreign expert. I became art director of the china and glass industry  and eventually under Stalin's purges    at the beginning of Stalin's purges  I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested. So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges  and spent    months in a Russian prison. The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life. This was a very dangerous accusation. And if this is the end of my five minutes  I want to tell you that I actually did survive  which was a surprise. But since I survived and I'm here  and since this is the end of the five minutes  I will    Moderator  Tell me when your last trip to Russia was. Weren't you there recently  EZ  Oh  this summer  in fact  the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company  invited me. They found out that I had worked in '   at this factory  and they came to my studio in Rockland County  and brought the    of their artists to visit me here. And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer  in July  to make some dishes  design some dishes. And since I don't like to travel alone  they also invited my daughter  son in law and granddaughter  so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today  which is not a very pleasant and happy view. Here I am now  if this is the end  Thank you. What I'd like you to do is  just really quickly  is just  sort of  nod to the person on your right  and then nod to the person on your left. Now  chances are that over the last winter  if you had been a beehive  either you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died. Now  that's an awful lot of bees. And this is the second year in a row we have lost over    percent of the colonies  or we estimate we've lost    percent of the colonies over the winter. Now  that's a lot  a lot of bees  and that's really important. And most of those losses are because of things we know. We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses  and we also have this new phenomenon  which I talked about last year  Colony Collapse Disorder. And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December. And below  you can see all these out yards  or temporary yards  where the colonies are brought in until February  and then they're shipped out to the almonds. And one documentary writer  who was here and looked at this two months after I was here  described this not as beehives but as a graveyard  with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them. Now  I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is. And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu. And this flu has wiped through the population of bees. In some cases  and in fact in most cases in one year  this flu was caused by a new virus to us  or newly identified by us  called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus. It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it  and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease  because  of course  there's the implication. But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous. It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus  and so the question we're still struggling with  and the question that keeps us up at night  is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu  and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases  And we don't have the answer to that yet  and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out. We think perhaps it's a combination of factors. We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that  you know  we're finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive  and surprisingly  sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these very strange things that we can't begin to understand. And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health. Now of course  if you lose a lot of colonies  beekeepers can replace them very quickly. And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss. If we lost one in every three cows in the winter  you know  the National Guard would be out. But what beekeepers can do is  if they have one surviving colony  they can split that colony in two. And then the one half that doesn't have a queen  they can buy a queen. It comes in the mail  it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida  and you can introduce that queen. And in fact  America was the first country that ever did mail delivery queens and in fact  it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country. If you don't just want a queen  you can buy  actually  a three pound package of bees  which comes in the mail  and of course  the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get  you know  your three pound packages of bees. And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead out. So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead outs  and so they've been able to cover those losses. So even though we've lost    percent of the colonies every year  the same number of colonies have existed in the country  at about  .  million colonies. Now  those losses are tragic on many fronts  and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper. And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first  because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet. If this was a group of beekeepers  you would have everyone from the card carrying NRA member who's  you know  live free or die  to the  you know  the self expressed quirky San Francisco backyard pig farmer. And you get all of these people in the same room  and they're all engaged and they're getting along  and they're all there because of the passion for bees. Now  there's another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers  the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone. And these tend to be some of the most independent  tenacious  intuitive  you know  inventive people you will ever meet. They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world. I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year. And Haiti  if you've ever been there  is just a tragedy. I mean  there may be     explanations for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is  but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor. But you meet this beekeeper  and I met this beekeeper here  and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met. No formal education  but very knowledgeable. We needed beeswax for a project we were working on  he was so capable  he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen from cow dung  tin cans and his veil  which he used as a screening  right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring. We also have Dave Hackenberg  who is the poster child of CCD. He's the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells. And he has a history of these trucks  and he's moved these bees up and down the coast. And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees  and that being bad  but we've done that for thousands of years. The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts  so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all. And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead out colonies. And you can do that one year in a row  you may be able to do it two years in a row. But if you're losing    percent to    percent of your colonies  you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried about losing this segment of our industry. And that's important for many fronts  and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture. And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America. You know  they pick up their hives  they move their families once or twice in a year. And if you look at Florida  in Dade City  Florida  that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go. And then    miles down the road is Groveland  and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go. And if you're ever in Central Valley in February  you go to this caf  at    o'clock in the morning  Kathy and Kate's. And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves. They all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience  and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time  because that's quite essential American experience. And we see these families  these nomadic families  you know  father to son  father to son  and these guys are hurting. And they're not people who like to ask for help  although they are the most helpful people ever. If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul  everyone pitches in and gives    hives to help him replace those lost colonies. And so  it's a very dynamic  and I think  historic and exciting community to be involved with. Of course  the real importance for bees is not the honey. And although I highly encourage you  all use honey. I mean  it's the most ethical sweetener  and you know  it's a dynamic and fun sweetener. But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees. Now  I want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning    a little cranberry juice  some fruits  some granola  I should have had whole wheat bread  I realized  but you know  jam on my Wonderbread  and some coffee    and had we taken out all those ingredients     except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola    if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated  we wouldn't have much on our plate. So if we did not have bees  it's not like we would starve  but clearly our diet would be diminished. It's said that for bees  the flower is the fountain of life  and for flowers bees are the messengers of love. And that's a really great expression  because really  bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are  you know    they get paid for their services. They get paid by pollen and nectar  to move that male sperm  the pollen  from flower to flower. And there are flowers that are self infertile. That means they can't    the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves. So in an apple orchard  for instance  you'll have rows of    apples of one variety  and then you have another apple tree that's a different type of pollen. And bees are very faithful. When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower  they stay to that crop exclusively  in order to help generate. And of course  they're made to carry this pollen. They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom. However  honeybees are a minority. Honeybees are not native to America  they were introduced with the colonialists. And there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined. In Pennsylvania alone  we have been surveying bees for     years  and very intensely in the last three years. We have identified over     species of bees in Pennsylvania. Thirty two species have not been identified or found in the state since     . Now  that could be because we haven't been sampling right  but it does  I think  suggest that something's wrong with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating. We have bumblebees on the top. And bumblebees are what we call eusocial  they're not truly social  because only the queen is  over winter. We also have the sweat bees  and these are little gems flying around. They're like tiny little flies and they fly around. And then you have another type of bee  which we call kleptoparasites  which is a very fancy way of saying  bad minded  murdering    what's the word I'm looking for  Murdering    Audience  Bee  Dennis vanEngelsdorp  Bee. Okay  thanks. What these bees do is  they sit there. These solitary bees  they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch  and they collect pollen and make it into a ball  and they lay an egg on it. Well  these bees hang out at that hole  and they wait for that mother to fly away  they go in  eat the egg  and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work. And so  in fact  if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees  you know that your environment is healthy  because they're top of the food chain bees. And in fact  there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared  and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites  but also these bumblebees. And in fact  if you guys live on the West Coast  go to these websites here  and they're really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees  because we think some have gone extinct. Or some  the population has declined. And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble  but we don't understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community. And of course  bees are not the only important factor here. There are other animals that pollinate  like bats  and bats are in trouble too. And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man  because there's no money to research the bat problems. And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate. White nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats. If there's a cave in New York that had        bats in it  and there are       left. That's like San Francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years. And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that. But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause of all these conditions  and that cause is NDD  Nature Deficit Disorder. And that is that I think that what we have in our society is  we forgot our connection with nature. And I think if we reconnect to nature  we'll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems. And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD. And that is  make meadows and not lawns. And I think we have lost our connection  and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment. I've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while  and it is terribly engaging. And if we look at the history of lawns  it's actually rather tragic. It used to be  two  three hundred years ago  that a lawn was a symbol of prestige  and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually  deserts  they're totally sterile. Americans spent  in            percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns. Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns. And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent keeping our lawns  which are these useless biosystems. And so we need to rethink this idea. In fact  you know  the White House used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I  which probably is not a bad idea  it wouldn't be a bad idea. I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns. I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale  and I think we're encouraged to do that. But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here  because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational. That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there. These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants  or insects  that come to these flowers  to watch that    and we've heard about  you know  this relationship you can have with wine  this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances. And this is a companion  and this is a relationship that never dries up. You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine  too. And I encourage you to look at that. Now  not all of us have meadows  or lawns that we can convert  and so you can always  of course  grow a meadow in a pot. Bees apparently  can be the gateway to  you know  other things. So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot  but a pot in a meadow. But you can also have this great community of city or building top beekeepers  these beekeepers that live    This is in Paris where these beekeepers live. And everyone should open a beehive  because it is the most amazing  incredible thing. And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD  or Nature Deficit Disorder  I think this is a great way of doing it. Get a beehive and grow a meadow  and watch that life come back into your life. And so with that  I think that what we can do  if we do this  we can make sure that our future    our more perfect future    includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows. And that journey    that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there    is an extremely exciting one. And I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day. So thank you very much for being here.  Thank you very much. These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years  and are responsible for much of what s gone on on our planet. This is an example of a real meteorite  and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth  and just how much of it survives and melts. From a meteorite from space  we re over here with an original Sputnik. This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space. This is not a copy. The space age began    years ago in October  and that s exactly what Sputnik looked like. And it wouldn t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back  on Apollo   . The astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits. They would bring them back and mount them. So this has actually been carried to the moon and back. So that s for fun. The dawn of books is  of course  important. And it wouldn t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible. You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg in     . But what s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible  and the dawn of this technology  is not the book. You see  the book was not driven by reading. In       nobody could read. So why did the printing press succeed  This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible. So you re looking here at one of the first printed books using movable type in the history of man      years ago. We are living at the age here at the end of the book  where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it. But why is this so interesting  Here s the quick story. It turns out that in the     s  the Catholic Church needed money  and so they actually hand wrote these things called indulgences  which were forgiveness s on pieces of paper. They traveled all around Europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands. They got you out of purgatory faster. And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences  which was the equivalent of printing money. And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in         to print out thousands  and then hundreds of thousands  and then ultimately millions of single  small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven. That is why the printing press succeeded  and that is why Martin Luther nailed his    theses to the door  because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe. So the printing press  ladies and gentlemen  was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading. More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures. We re going to have some tomorrow. Instead of showing an object from the stage I m going to do something special for the first time. We are going to show  actually  what the library looks like  OK  So  I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world. You re going to find out why in a minute  because when I went to see Eileen  this is what I said I wanted to build. This is the Library of Human Imagination. The room itself is three stories tall. In the glass panels are       years of human imagination that are computer controlled. The room is a theatre. It changes colors. And all throughout the library are different objects  different spaces. It s designed like an Escher print. Here is some of the lower level of the library  where the exhibits constantly change. You can walk through. You can touch. You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room. There s my very own Saturn V. Everybody should have one  OK   Laughter  So you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects. In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination. There is a glass bridge that you walk across that s suspended in space. So it s a leap of imagination. How do we create  Part of the question that I have answered is  is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli  with human achievement  with history  with the things that drive us and make us human    the passionate discovery  the bones of dinosaurs long gone  the maps of space that we ve experienced  and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination. So hopefully tomorrow I ll show one or two more objects from the stage  but for today I just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it. And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home and share it with the TED community. TED is all about patterns in the clouds. It s all about connections. It s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before. And that s really what discovery and imagination is all about. For example  we can look at a DNA molecule model here. None of us really have ever seen one  but we know it exists because we ve been taught to understand this molecule. But we can also look at an Enigma machine from the Nazis in World War II that was a coding and decoding machine. Now  you might say  what does this have to do with this  Well  this is the code for life  and this is a code for death. These two molecules code and decode. And yet  looking at them  you would see a machine and a molecule. But once you ve seen them in a new way  you realize that both of these things really are connected. And they re connected primarily because of this here. You see  this is a human brain model  OK  And it s rare  because we never really get to see a brain. We get to see a skull. But there it is. All of imagination    everything that we think  we feel  we sense    comes through the human brain. And once we create new patterns in this brain  once we shape the brain in a new way  it never returns to its original shape. And I ll give you a quick example. We think about the Internet  we think about information that goes across the Internet. And we never think about the hidden connection. But I brought along here a lump of coal    right here  one lump of coal. And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet  You see  it takes the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net. So every time you download a file  each megabyte is a lump of coal. What that means is  a     megabyte file looks like this  ladies and gentlemen. OK  So the next time you download a gigabyte  or two gigabytes  it s not for free  OK  The connection is the energy it takes to run the web   and to make everything we think possible  possible. Thanks  Chris. We all make decisions every day  we want to know what the right thing is to do    in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic. And surely  if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times  that would be a tremendous gift. It turns out that  in fact  the world was given this gift in      by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli. And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is  and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference. Now  this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote. And if it looks like Greek to you  it's because  well  it's Greek. But the simple English translation    much less precise  but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say    was this  The expected value of any of our actions    that is  the goodness that we can count on getting    is the product of two simple things  the odds that this action will allow us to gain something  and the value of that gain to us. In a sense  what Bernoulli was saying is  if we can estimate and multiply these two things  we will always know precisely how we should behave. Now  this simple equation  even for those of you who don't like equations  is something that you're quite used to. Here's an example  if I were to tell you  let's play a little coin toss game  and I'm going to flip a coin  and if it comes up heads  I'm going to pay you    dollars  but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me  most of you would say  sure  I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half  the gain if you do is    dollars  that multiplies to five  and that's more than I'm charging you to play. So  the answer is  yes. This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet. Now  the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses  but in fact  it's not very simple in everyday life. People are horrible at estimating both of these things  and that's what I want to talk to you about today. There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do  and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed  and errors in estimating the value of their own success. Now  let me talk about the first one first. Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy  there are six sides to a die  two sides to a coin     cards in a deck. You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads. But as it turns out  this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more    I should say  lose more    gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined. The reason is  this isn't how people do odds. The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs. Now  the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford. And of course  you all know that the answer is dogs. And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes. It was very easy to remember seeing dogs  not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind  then dogs on leashes are more probable. That's not a bad rule of thumb  except when it is. So  for example  here's a word puzzle. Are there more four letter English words with R in the third place or R in the first place  Well  you check memory very briefly  make a quick scan  and it's awfully easy to say to yourself  Ring  Rang  Rung  and very hard to say to yourself  Pare  Park  they come more slowly. But in fact  there are many more words in the English language with R in the third than the first place. The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable  unlikely or infrequent. It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter. You kind of shout out the sound  S    and the word comes. It's like the dictionary  it's hard to look things up by the third letter. So  this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability    how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles  though. For example  when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways    these are estimates of number of deaths per year per     million U.S. citizens. And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado  fireworks  asthma  drowning  etc. Compare these to the actual numbers. Now  you see a very interesting pattern here  which is first of all  two things are vastly over estimated  namely tornadoes and fireworks. Two things are vastly underestimated  dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why  When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was   Boy dies of Asthma   It's not interesting because it's so common. It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we've seen tornadoes devastating cities  or some poor schmuck who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July. Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage. They don't come quickly to mind  and as a result  we vastly underestimate them. Indeed  this is kind of like the Sesame Street game of  Which thing doesn't belong   And you're right to say it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong  because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous. The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide. The lottery is an excellent example  of course    an excellent test case of people's ability to compute probabilities. And economists    forgive me  for those of you who play the lottery    but economists  at least among themselves  refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax  because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet    which  by the way  doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything. Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery  Well  there are many answers  but one answer surely is  we see a lot of winners. Right  When this couple wins the lottery  or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check    how the hell do you cash things that size  I don't know. We see this on TV  we read about it in the paper. When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost  Indeed  if we required that television stations run a    second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner  the     million losers in the last lottery would require nine and a half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say   Me  I lost.   Me  I lost.  Now  if you watch nine and a half years of television    no sleep  no potty breaks    and you saw loss after loss after loss  and then at the end there's    seconds of   and I won   the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small. Look  I can prove this to you  here's a little lottery. There's    tickets in this lottery. Nine of them have been sold to these individuals. It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and  if you win  you get    bucks. Is this a good bet  Well  Bernoulli tells us it is. The expected value of this lottery is two dollars  this is a lottery in which you should invest your money. And most people say   OK  I'll play.  Now  a slightly different version of this lottery  imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy. Leroy has nine tickets  there's one left. Do you want it  Most people won't play this lottery. Now  you can see the odds of winning haven't changed  but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win. It's easy to see Leroy getting the check  right  You can't say to yourself   I'm as likely to win as anybody   because you're not as likely to win as Leroy. The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play  even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds. Now  estimating odds  as difficult as it may seem  is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value  trying to say what something is worth  how much we'll enjoy it  how much pleasure it will give us. I want to talk now about errors in value. How much is this Big Mac worth  Is it worth    dollars  Most of you have the intuition that it's not    you wouldn't pay that for it. But in fact  to decide whether a Big Mac is worth    dollars requires that you ask one  and only one question  which is  What else can I do with    dollars  If you've ever gotten on one of those long haul flights to Australia and realized that they're not going to serve you any food  but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald's bag  and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat  you think  I can't do anything else with this    dollars for    hours. I can't even set it on fire    they took my cigarette lighter  Suddenly     dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal. On the other hand  if you're visiting an underdeveloped country  and    dollars buys you a gourmet meal  it's exorbitant for a Big Mac. Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no  before I'd even told you anything about the context  Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking   What else can I do with my money   comparing this investment to other possible investments  you compared to the past. And this is a systematic error people make. What you knew is  you paid three dollars in the past     is outrageous. This is an error  and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads. For example  this is  of course  one of the most delicious tricks in marketing  is to say something used to be higher  and suddenly it seems like a very good deal. When people are asked about these two different jobs  a job where you make   K  then   K  then   K  a job where you're getting a salary cut each year  and one in which you're getting a salary increase  people like the second job better than the first  despite the fact they're all told they make much less money. Why  Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages  even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here's another nice example. Here's a        Hawaiian vacation package  it's now on sale for      . Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii  would you buy this package  Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story         Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for     dollars  so you decide to mull it over for a week. By the time you get to the ticket agency  the best fares are gone    the package now costs      . Would you buy it  Most people say  no. Why  Because it used to cost      and there's no way I'm paying       for something that was     last week. This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words  a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal. Here's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions. Imagine that you're going to the theater. You're on your way to the theater. In your wallet you have a ticket  for which you paid    dollars. You also have a    dollar bill. When you arrive at the theater  you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket. Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it  Most people answer  no. Now  let's just change one thing in this scenario. You're on your way to the theater  and in your wallet you have two    dollar bills. When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them. Would you spend your remaining    dollars on a ticket  Well  of course  I went to the theater to see the play. What does the loss of    dollars along the way have to do  Now  just in case you're not getting it  here's a schematic of what happened  OK  Along the way  you lost something. In both cases  it was a piece of paper. In one case  it had a U.S. president on it  in the other case it didn't. What the hell difference should it make  The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself  I'm not paying twice for the same thing. You compare the cost of the play now       dollars    to the cost that it used to have       dollars    and you say it's a bad deal. Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people's attempts to assign value. But even when we compare with the possible  instead of the past  we still make certain kinds of mistakes. And I'm going to show you one or two of them. One of the things we know about comparison  that when we compare one thing to the other  it changes its value. So in       this fellow  George Bush  for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum  didn't seem like such a great guy. Suddenly  we're almost longing for him to return. The comparison changes how we evaluate him. Now  retailers knew this long before anybody else did  of course  and they use this wisdom to help you    spare you the undue burden of money. And so a retailer  if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine  and you see them here for eight     and    dollars  what would you do  Most people don't want the most expensive  they don't want the least expensive. So  they will opt for the item in the middle. If you're a smart retailer  then  you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf  because suddenly the     wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison. So I'm telling you something you already knew  namely  that comparison changes the value of things. Here's why that's a problem  the problem is that when you get that     bottle of wine home  it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to. The comparisons we make when we are appraising value  where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things  are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them. This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions. Let me just give you an example. I have to show you something from my own lab  so let me sneak this in. These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions  How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now  They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them. For some of the subjects  sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates  and for others is a can of Spam. In fact  these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips. Namely  those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty  those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they won't be nearly so tasty. Of course  what happens when they eat the potato chips  Well  look  you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy  salty  crispy  delicious snacks  what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience. Nonetheless  their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience. You've all experienced this yourself  even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question  You want to buy a car stereo. The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for     dollars  but if you drive across town  you can get it for     bucks. So would you drive to get    percent off  saving     dollars  Most people say they would. They can't imagine buying it for twice the price when  with one trip across town  they can get it for half off. Now  let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo  and the dealer near your house had it for       . But if you drove across town  you could get it for       . Would you drive to get it  At this point   .    savings    the     dollars. Most people say  no  I'm going to schlep across town to save     bucks on the purchase of a car  This kind of thinking drives economists crazy  and it should. Because this     dollars that you save    hello     doesn't know where it came from. It doesn't know what you saved it on. When you go to buy groceries with it  it doesn't go  I'm the money saved on the car stereo  or  I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money. And if a drive across town is worth     bucks  it's worth     bucks no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way. That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking  .  percent or  .   percent of their investment  but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste. Now  you can see  this is the problem of shifting comparisons  because what you're doing is  you're comparing the     bucks to the purchase that you're making  but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison. You've all had this experience. If you're an American  for example  you've probably traveled in France. And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown  and you thought   Oh  my God  these people are so warm. They're so nice to me. I mean  compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't  these people are just wonderful.  And so you tour France with them  and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner  and what do you find  Compared to your regular friends  they are boring and dull  right  Because in this new context  the comparison is very  very different. In fact  you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship. Now  you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo. You go to the stereo store  you see two sets of speakers    these big  boxy  monoliths  and these little  sleek speakers  and you play them  and you go  you know  I do hear a difference  the big ones sound a little better. And so you buy them  and you bring them home  and you entirely violate the d cor of your house. And the problem  of course  is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you'll never make again. What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go   Sounds so much better than those little ones   which you can't even remember hearing. The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time. People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time. And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules. So let me give you one very easy problem  a second very easy problem and then a third  hard  problem. Here's the first easy problem  You can have    dollars now or    dollars now. Which would you prefer  This is what we call a one item IQ test  OK  All of us  I hope  prefer more money  and the reason is  we believe more is better than less. Here's the second problem  You can have    dollars today or    dollars in a month. Which would you prefer  Again  an easy decision  because we all know that now is better than later. What's hard in our decision making is when these two rules conflict. For example  when you're offered    dollars now or    dollars in a month. This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting  but you have to be patient. What do we know  What do people do in these kinds of situations  Well  by and large people are enormously impatient. That is  they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra    dollars. Maybe that isn't so remarkable  but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen. Imagine that you can have    dollars in a year    that's    months    or    dollars in    months. What do we find now  People are gladly willing to wait  as long as they're waiting     they might as well wait   . What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen  Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you. This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond  which is  people find that the subjective value of    is higher than the subjective value of    when they'll be delivered in now or one month  respectively    a    day delay    but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year. Now  why in the world do you get this pattern of results  These guys can tell us. What you see here are two lads  one of them larger than the other  the fireman and the fiddler. They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon  and I want you to notice two things. At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point. However  the difference between them seems to be getting smaller. First it's an inch in your view  then it's a quarter inch  then a half inch  and then finally they go off the edge of the earth. Here are the results of what I just showed you. This is the subjective height    the height you saw of these guys at various points. And I want you to see that two things are true. One  the farther away they are  the smaller they look  and two  the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler. But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right. At a very close distance  the fiddler looks taller than the fireman  but at a far distance their normal  their true  relations are preserved. As Plato said  what space is to size  time is to value. These are the results of the hard problem I gave you     now or    in a month  And these are subjective values  and what you can see is  our two rules are preserved. People always think more is better than less     is always better than     and they always think now is better than later  the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side. Watch what happens when we drop some out. Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us. We have the tendency for people to go for    dollars now over waiting a month  but not if that decision is far in the future. Notice something interesting that this implies    namely  that when people get to the future  they will change their minds. That is  as that month    approaches  you will say  what was I thinking  waiting an extra month for    dollars  I'll take the    dollars now. Well  the question with which I'd like to end is this  If we're so damn stupid  how did we get to the moon  Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value. The answer to this question  I think  is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks  and I dare say you will hear again  namely  that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living. They were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups  rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves  had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today. Bernoulli's gift  Bernoulli's little formula  allows us  it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us. That explains why we are so bad at using it  but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good  fast. We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands. We have no significant predators  we're the masters of our physical environment  the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us. The only thing    the only thing    that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions. If we're not here in        years  it's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in       because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures. Thank you. Chris Anderson  That was remarkable. We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two. Bill Lyell  Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us  and is there some way that we could counteract that  Dan Gilbert  I actually was consulting recently with the Department of Homeland Security  which generally believes that American security dollars should go to making borders safer. I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events  and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified  rather than    not rather than  but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about. Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to    and forgive me  but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents. We already know  for example  in the United States  more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes    because they were scared    and driving on highways  than were killed in     . OK  If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill        Americans next year  you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu. These are small scale accidents  and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play  the kind of coverage  that they do. Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways  and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us. CA  Dan  I'd like to hear more on this. So  you're saying that our response to terror is  I mean  it's a form of mental bug  Talk more about it. DG  It's out sized. I mean  look. If Australia disappears tomorrow  terror is probably the right response. That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand  when a bus blows up and    people are killed  more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country. Is terror the right response  CA  What causes the bug  Is it the drama of the event    that it's so spectacular  Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by  quote  outsiders  What is it  DG  Yes. It's a number of things  and you hit on several of them. First  it's a human agent trying to kill us    it's not a tree falling on us by accident. Second  these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again. People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason    as if there's good reason  but sometimes people think there are. So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event  but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media  who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can. CA  I mean  what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it  DG  Well  go to Israel. You know  go to Israel. And a mall blows up  and then everybody's unhappy about it  and an hour and a half later    at least when I was there  and I was     feet from the mall when it blew up    I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on. And as the Israeli mother said  she said   We never let them win by stopping weddings.  I mean  this is a society that has learned    and there are others too    that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it  shall I say  as those of us who have not had many terror attacks. CA  But is there a rational fear that actually  the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come  DG  Yes  of course. So  if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be  there might be more and more buses of    people    we would probably not be nearly so frightened. I don't want to say    please  I'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying   Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed.  That's not my point at all. What I'm saying is that  surely  rationally  our distress about things that happen  about threats  should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come. I think in the case of terrorism  it isn't. And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today    how many people do you know got up and said  Poverty  I can't believe what poverty is doing to us. People get up in the morning  they don't care about poverty. It's not making headlines  it's not making news  it's not flashy. There are no guns going off. I mean  if you had to solve one of these problems  Chris  which would you solve  Terrorism or poverty  That's a tough one. CA  There's no question. Poverty  by an order of magnitude  a huge order of magnitude  unless someone can show that there's  you know  terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come. The latest I've read  seen  thought is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that. If that turns out to be wrong  we all look silly  but with poverty it's a bit    DG  Even if that were true  still more people die from poverty. CA  We've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past  in the ancient past  we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth  and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things  People died  so be it. But if you got attacked  that was something you could do something about. And so we evolved these responses. Is that what happened  DG  Well  you know  the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves. My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past. But rather  if you're looking for an evolutionary explanation  you might say that most organisms are neo phobic    that is  they're a little scared of stuff that's new and different. And there's a good reason to be  because old stuff didn't eat you. Right  Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you've never seen before. So  you know  when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before  our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated. I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to  but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it. Jay Walker  You know  economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of  which is the error of value. I know  because I've interviewed about       lottery buyers over the years. It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning. That's what you think it is. All right  The average lottery buyer buys about     tickets a year  so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose  and yet she buys     tickets a year. Why is that  It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid. It's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain  and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you've lost. Or  to put it another way  for the dollar investment  you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet  which you cannot have a good feeling from. Now  economists tend to       economists tend to view the world through their own lenses  which is  this is just a bunch of stupid people. And as a result  many people look at economists as stupid people. And so fundamentally  the reason we got to the moon is  we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much. DG  Well  no  it's a great point. It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember  people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either  even though they don't feel great during the drawing. I would disagree that people know they're not going to win. I think they think it's unlikely  but it could happen  which is why they prefer that to the flushing. But certainly I see your point  that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning. Now  I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists. That isn't one of them  for me  but there's many others. CA  Last question. Aubrey de Grey  My name's Aubrey de Grey  from Cambridge. I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills    I work on aging    and I'm interested in doing something about it  as we'll all hear tomorrow. I very much resonate with what you're saying  because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice  DG  For you or for them  AdG  In persuading them. DG  Ah  for you in persuading them. Well  it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted. But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly. One of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future. To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future  people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way. So  would you like to have an extra         dollars when you're    is a question that's very different than  imagine who you'll be when you're     will you be living  what will you look like  how much hair will you have  who will you be living with. Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario  suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money. But these are tricks around the margins. I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency  which is to say   I'm here today  and so now is more important than later.  CA  Dan  thank you. Members of the audience  that was a fantastic session. Thank you. I'm just going to play a brief video clip. Video  On the fifth of December       a bottle of      Lafitte was sold for         pounds    nine times the previous world record. The buyer was Kip Forbes  son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the   th century. The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the   th century. Ch teau Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world  the prince of any wine cellar. Benjamin Wallace  Now  that's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest running mystery in the modern wine world. And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock. In       he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery. Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall  and happened upon this hidden cache of wines    apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson.           . He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles  he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building. The mystery persisted for about    years. It finally began to get resolved in      because of this guy. Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles  and he became suspicious. And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex FBI and ex Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this. There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man  and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes. But for those    years  an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles. I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world  must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world. I became increasingly  kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know  why do people spend these crazy amounts of money  not only on wine but on lots of things  and are they living a better life than me  So  I decided to embark on a quest. With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes  I decided to sample the very best  or most expensive  or most coveted item in about a dozen categories  which was a very grueling quest   as you can imagine. This was the first one. A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing. It may come from Wagyu cattle  but it's not from the original  Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan. There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe  and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant  Cut  in Los Angeles. I went there  and I ordered the eight ounce rib eye for     dollars. And it arrived  and it was tiny. And I was outraged. It was like      dollars for this  And then I took a bite  and I wished that it was tinier  because Kobe beef is so rich. It's like foie gras    it's not even like steak. I almost couldn't finish it. I was really happy when I was done. Now  the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them  so that's why you're going to see this recurring character. Which  I guess  you know  communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price. White truffles. One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world. To try this  I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan    Del Posto. The waiter  you know  came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver  and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said  you know   Would Signore like the truffles   And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma. It's not in their taste  really. It's not in their texture. It's in the smell. These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles  this haunting  wonderful  nutty  mushroomy smell wafted up.    seconds passed and it was gone. And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that  you know  their purpose had been served  and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me. There were several    several of these items were disappointments. Yeah. The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there. They did give me a tour  though. And this hotel suite is       square feet. It has     degree views. It has four balconies. It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei. It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver. It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from. When I took the tour  it actually included some Opus One  I was glad to see.        dollars for a night in a hotel. This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles  which have antibacterial properties. I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this. And it  you know  tickled a little bit and it smelled good  but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today. But then again  nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing. These ones GQ did spring for    I own these    but I will tell you  not only did I not get a compliment from any of you  I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these. I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment should be the test of something's value  but I think in the case of a fashion item  an article of clothing  that's a reasonable benchmark. That said  a lot of work goes into these. They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand dipped in natural indigo    times. But no compliments. Thank you. Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany. And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light. He uses tiny bottles  the glass is tinted  he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas. And he actually    once he releases a batch of it  he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online  so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing  and  you know  gauge its freshness. I did a blind taste test of this with    people and five other olive oils. It tasted fine. It tasted interesting. It was very green  it was very peppery. But in the blind taste test  it came in last. The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods     olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months. A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan    you'll start to notice. I don't play golf  so I couldn't actually road test these  but I did interview a guy who owns them. Even the people who market these clubs    I mean  they'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther    but they'll say  look  you know  you're not getting        dollars worth of performance from these clubs. You're paying for the bling  that they're encrusted with gold and platinum. The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them  so ... Oh  yeah  you know this one  This is a coffee made from a very unusual process. The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet. It's a cat that lives in trees  and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations. And apparently it's a very picky eater and it  you know  hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries. And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans  and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the  you know  results and processing it into coffee    although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form. That's right. Unrelatedly    Japan is doing crazy things with toilets. There is now a toilet that has an MP  player in it. There's one with a fragrance dispenser. There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor. It's almost like a home medical center    and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in. This one does not have those bells and whistles  but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best    the Neorest    . And to try this    I couldn't get a loaner  but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer  Toto  and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use  which I used. It's fully automated    you walk towards it  and the seat lifts. The seat is preheated. There's a water jet that cleans you. There's an air jet that dries you. You get up  it flushes by itself. The lid closes  it self cleans. Not only is it a technological leap forward  but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward. I mean  a no hands  no toilet paper toilet. And I want to get one of these. This was another one I could not get a loaner of. Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed. There's a little plaque on the end that  you know  each buyer gets their name engraved on it. To try this one  the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom. Lights glaring in off the street  and we had to hire a security guard and all these things. But anyway  we had a great night's sleep. And you spend a third of your life in bed. I don't think it's that bad of a deal. This was a fun one. This is the fastest street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car. I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company  a professional race car driver  and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway. And  you know  when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods. And it was really amazing. It was such a smooth ride. Most of the cars that I drive  if I get up to    they start to rattle. I switched lanes on the highway and the driver  this chaperone  said   You know  you were just going     miles an hour.  And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic  because it was just that smooth. And if I was a billionaire  I would get one. This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology. This is Tom Cruise arriving at the  Mission  Impossible III  premiere. When he tries to open the door  you could call it  Mission  Impossible IV.  There was one object that I could not get my hands on  and that was the      Cheval Blanc. The '   Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the   th century. And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape. And      was a legendary vintage  especially in the right bank of Bordeaux. And just together  that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following. But it's    years old. There's not much of it left. What there is of it left you don't know if it's real    it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world. Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist. So  I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these. I'd put out feelers to retailers  to auctioneers  and it was coming up empty. And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai. Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings  and he said   I've got a tasting coming up where we're going to serve the '   Cheval Blanc.  And it was going to be a double vertical    it was going to be    vintages of Cheval Blanc  and    vintages of Yquem. And it was an invitation you do not refuse. I went. It was three days  four meals. And at lunch on Saturday  we opened the '  . And you know  it had this fragrant softness  and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil. And then I tasted it  and it  you know  had this kind of unctuous  porty richness  which is characteristic of that wine    that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways. There were people at my table who thought it was  you know  fantastic. There were some people who were a little less impressed. And I wasn't that impressed. And I don't    call my palate a philistine palate    so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed  but I was not the only one there who had that reaction. And it wasn't just to that wine. Any one of the wines served at this tasting  if I'd been served it at a dinner party  it would have been  you know  the wine experience of my lifetime  and incredibly memorable. But drinking    great wines over three days  they all just blurred together  and it became almost a grueling experience. And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech. And they gave subjects the same wine  labeled with different price tags. A lot of people  you know  said that they liked the more expensive wine more    it was the same wine  but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive. But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine  and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more    their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag. Thank you. The career that I started early on in my life was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places  and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic  and high deserts and low deserts. Until about a dozen years ago  when I was really captured by caves  and I really re focused most of my research in that direction. So I have a really cool day job   I get to do some really amazing stuff. I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet. Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them  but nevertheless  they're absolutely gripping  and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very  very different from those that we have on the planet. Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo microbiology that we do there  we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets. Particularly Mars  but also Europa  the small  icy moon around Jupiter. And perhaps  someday  far beyond our solar system itself. I'm very passionately interested in the human future  on the Moon and Mars particularly  and elsewhere in the solar system. I think it's time that we transitioned to a solar system going civilization and species. And  as an outgrowth of all of this then  I wonder about whether we can  and whether we even should  think about transporting Earth type life to other planets. Notably Mars  as a first example. Something I never talk about in scientific meetings is how I actually got to this state and why I do the work that I do. Why don't I have a normal job  a sensible job  And then of course  I blame the Soviet Union. Because in the mid     s  when I was a tiny child  they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik  which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin. And a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids. And I'm a product of that generation  like so many other of my peers. It really caught hold of us  and caught fire  and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now. Of course  refusing to grow up       even though I impersonate a grown up in daily life  but I do a fairly good job of that    but really retaining that childlike quality of not caring what other people think about what you're interested in  is really critical. The next element is the fact that I have applied a value judgment and my value judgment is that the presence of life is better than no life. And so  life is more valuable than no life. And so I think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach. I'm very interested in Mars  of course  and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the Viking Landers landed on Mars. And that took what had been a tiny little astronomical object in the sky  that you would see as a dot  and turned it completely into a landscape  as that very first primitive picture came rastering across the screen. And when it became a landscape  it also became a destination  and altered  really  the course of my life. In my graduate years I worked with my colleague and mentor and friend  Steve Schneider  at the National Center for Atmospheric Research  working on global change issues. We've written a number of things on the role of Gaia hypothesis    whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense  and then  as an outgrowth of that  I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war. So  wonderful things and grim things. But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes  not just as our home. And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective  to try to then think about the way our planet behaves  as a planet  and with the life that's on it. And all of this seems to me to be a salient point in history. We're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond. So  back to Mars. How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars  Well  sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other  even on this planet. So  finding life on another planet is a non trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that. Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful sort of depends on what you think about the chances of life in the universe. I think  myself  that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time. So  you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen  and then you get helium  and then you get more complicated stuff  and you get planets forming    and life is a common  planetary based phenomenon  in my view. Certainly  in the last    years  we've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed  and just last month  a couple of weeks ago  a planet in the size class of Earth has actually been found. And so this is very exciting news. So  my first bold prediction is that  is that in the universe  life is going to be everywhere. It's going to be everywhere we look    where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it. And those planetary systems are going to be very common. So  what about life on Mars  Well  if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be  I would've probably said  a couple of percent. And even that was considered outrageous at the time. I was once sneeringly introduced by a former NASA official  as the only person on the planet who still thought there was life on Mars. Of course  that official is now dead  and I'm not  so there's a certain amount of glory in outliving your adversaries. But things have changed greatly over the last dozen years. And the reason that they have changed is because we now have new information. The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '    and the MER Rover missions that are on Mars as we speak now and the European Space Agency's Mars Express  has taught us a number of amazing things. There is sub surface ice on that planet. And so where there is water  there is a very high chance of our kind of life. There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place   one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed  and there are these amazing structures called blueberries  which are these little  rocky concretions that we are busy making biologically in my lab right now. So  with all of these things put together  I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would've ever thought. I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars  sometime in its past  is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half. So this is a very bold statement. I think it's there  and I think we need to go look for it  and I think it's underground. So the game's afoot  and this is the game that we play in astro biology. How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life  How do you plan to look for it  How do you know it when you find it  Because if it's big and obvious  we would've already found it    it would've already bitten us on the foot  and it hasn't. So  we know that it's probably quite cryptic. Very critically  how do we protect it  if we find it  and not contaminate it  And also  even perhaps more critically  because this is the only home planet we have  how do we protect us from it  while we study it  So why might it be hard to find  Well  it's probably microscopic  and it's never easy to study microscopic things  although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth  at much smaller scales than ever before. But it's probably hiding  because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment  that makes you yummy  and other things might want to eat you  or consume you. And so  there's a game of predator prey that's going to be  essentially  universal  really  in any kind of biological system. It also may be very  very different in its fundamental properties   its chemistry  or its size. We say small  but what does that mean  Is it virus sized  Is it smaller than that  Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium  We don't know. And speed of activity  which is something that we face in our work with sub surface organisms  because they grow very  very slowly. If I were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a Petri plate  within about four or five hours  I would have to see growth. But the organisms that we work with  from the sub surface of Earth  very often it's months    and in many cases  years    before we see any growth whatsoever. So they are  intrinsically  a slower life form. But the real issue is that we are guided by our limited experience  and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know  then we can't recognize what to look for  or how to plan for it. So  perspective is everything and  because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about  I have learned to think about Earth as an extraterrestrial planet. And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things. This is my favorite game on airplanes  where you're in an airplane and you look out the window  you see the horizon. I always turn my head on the side  and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home  to seeing it as a planet. It's a very simple trick  and I never fail to do it when I'm sitting in a window seat. Well  this is what we apply to our work. This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in. This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco  in Mexico  and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid. There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide coming into this cave from volcanic sources and from the breakdown of evaporite    minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed    and it is a completely hostile environment for us. We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear  and    parts per million of H S will kill you. This is regularly several hundred parts per million. So  it's a very hazardous environment  with CO as well  and many other gases. These extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special. Because contrary to what you might think  this is not devoid of life. This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet  anywhere. It's bursting with life. The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right  but one of the reasons that we're interested in them is because they represent  really  the average conditions that we may expect on other planets. So  this is part of the ability that we have  to try to stretch our imagination  in terms of what we may find in the future. There's so much life in this cave  and I can't even begin to scratch the surface of it with you. But one of the most famous objects out of this are what we call Snottites  for obvious reasons. This stuff looks like what comes out of your two year old's nose when he has a cold. And this is produced by bacteria who are actually making more sulfuric acid  and living at pHs right around zero. And so  this stuff is like battery acid. And yet  everything in this cave has adapted to it. In fact  there's so much energy available for biology in this cave  that there's actually a huge number of cavefish. And the local Zoque Indians harvest this twice a year  as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration. This is very unusual for caves. In some of the other amazing caves that we work in    this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad  and this is one of the most famous caves in the world. It's     miles of mapped passage  it's pristine  it has no natural opening and it's a gigantic biological  geo microbiological laboratory. In this cave  great areas are covered by this reddish material that you see here  and also these enormous crystals of selenite that you can see dangling down. This stuff is produced biologically. This is the breakdown product of the bedrock  that organisms are busy munching their way through. They take iron and manganese minerals within the bedrock and they oxidize them. And every time they do that  they get a tiny little packet of energy. And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use  then  to run their life processes. Interestingly enough  they also do this with uranium and chromium  and various other toxic metals. And so  the obvious avenue for bio remediation comes from organisms like this. These organisms we now bring into the lab  and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates  and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves. So  these are signals that they leave in the rock record. Well  even in basalt surfaces in lava tube caves  which are a by product of volcanic activity  we find these walls totally covered  in many cases  by these beautiful  glistening silver walls  or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold. And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria. And you can see in these central images here  scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys    these are gardens of these bacteria. One of the interesting things about these particular guys is that they're in the actinomycete and streptomycete groups of the bacteria  which is where we get most of our antibiotics. The sub surface of Earth contains a vast biodiversity. And these organisms  because they're very separate from the surface  make a vast array of novel compounds. And so  the potential for exploiting this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses is completely untapped  but probably exceeds most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet. So  lava tube caves   I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet. We know that on Mars and the Moon there are tons of these structures. We can see them. On the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption    Mount Etna in Sicily    and this is the way these tubes form. And when they hollow out  then they become habitats for organisms. These are all over the planet Mars  and we're busy cataloguing them now. And so  there's very interesting cave real estate on Mars  at least of that type. In order to access these sub surface environments that we're interested in  we're very interested in developing the tools to do this. You know  it's not easy to get into these caves. It requires crawling  climbing  rope work  technical rope work and many other complex human motions in order to access these. We face the problem of  how can we do this robotically  Why would we want to do it robotically  Well  we're going to be sending robotic missions to Mars long in advance of human missions. And then  secondly  getting back to that earlier point that I made about the preciousness of any life that we may find on Mars  we don't want to contaminate it. And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary. And in this case  we're imagining intermediary robotic devices that can actually do some of that front end work for us  to protect any potential life that we find. I'm not going to go through all of these projects now  but we're involved in about half a dozen robotic development projects  in collaboration with a number of different groups. I want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top. These are hopping microbot swarms. I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT  and we have come up with the idea of having little  jumping bean like robots that are propelled by artificial muscle  which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties    are the EPAMs  or artificial muscles. And these allow them to hop. They behave with a swarm behavior  where they relate to each other  modeled after insect swarm behavior  and they could be made very numerous. And so  one can send a thousand of them  as you can see in this upper left hand picture  a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current MER Rovers. And these little guys    you could lose many of them. If you send a thousand of them  you could probably get rid of    percent of them and still have a mission. And so  that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go. Now  to wrap this up  I want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves. It occurred to us a number of years ago that caves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past. And perhaps it's time we started to explore those  in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration. So  we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study  looking at the irreducible set of technologies that you would need in order to actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes on the Moon or Mars. It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list  and we have gone in the relatively primitive technology direction. So  we're talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave  foamed in place airlocks to deal with this complex topology  various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies. And the future is there for us to use these lava tube caves on Mars. And right now we're in caves  and we're doing science and recreation  but I think in the future we'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies. Now  my view of what the current status of potential life on Mars is that it's probably been on the planet  maybe one in two chances. The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied  because we now know  from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth  that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets. One of the burning questions  of course  is if we go there and find life in the sub surface  as I fully expect that we will  is that a second genesis of life  Did life start here and was it transported there  Did it start there and get transported here  This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half century  and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions. Thank you. I was trying to think  how is sync connected to happiness  and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing. We like to dance together  we like singing together. And so  if you'll put up with this  I would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today. The experiment is    and I notice  by the way  that when you applauded  that you did it in a typical North American way  that is  you were raucous and incoherent. You were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison. Do you think you could do it  I would like to see if this audience would    no  you haven't practiced  as far as I know    can you get it together to clap in sync  Whoa  Now  that's what we call emergent behavior. So I didn't expect that  but    I mean  I expected you could synchronize. It didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency. It's interesting. So what do we make of that  First of all  we know that you're all brilliant. This is a room full of intelligent people  highly sensitive. Some trained musicians out there. Is that what enabled you to synchronize  So to put the question a little more seriously  let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did  for spontaneous synchronization. Do you need  for instance  to be as smart as you are  Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize  Do you need to be alive  I mean  that's a spooky thought  right  Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves. It's real. In fact  I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of  if not one of the most  perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature. It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos. It's a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy. I mean  I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong    it's not. But there is a countervailing force in the universe    the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme. Now  to get into that  let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature  which is the glorious example of birds that flock together  or fish swimming in organized schools. So these are not particularly intelligent creatures  and yet  as we'll see  they exhibit beautiful ballets. This is from a BBC show called  Predators   and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense. When you're small and vulnerable  like these starlings  or like the fish  it helps to swarm to avoid predators  to confuse predators. Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous. For a long time  biologists were puzzled by this behavior  wondering how it could be possible. We're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony. These creatures are not choreographed. They're choreographing themselves. And only today is science starting to figure out how it works. I'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin  a researcher at Oxford  that shows how swarms work. There are just three simple rules. First  all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors. Second  all the individuals have a tendency to line up. And third  they're all attracted to each other  but they try to keep a small distance apart. And when you build those three rules in  automatically you start to see swarms that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks. Now  fish like to stay close together  about a body length apart. Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart. But except for that difference  the rules are the same for both. Now  all this changes when a predator enters the scene. There's a fourth rule  when a predator's coming  get out of the way. Here on the model you see the predator attacking. The prey move out in random directions  and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again  so there's this constant splitting and reforming. And you see that in nature. Keep in mind that  although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate  what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior. Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers. That is  out of the desire to save itself  each creature is following these rules  and that leads to something that's safe for all of them. Even though it looks like they're thinking as a group  they're not. You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm  so you can think of several. As I say  if you're in a swarm  your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group. There are many eyes to spot danger. And you'll see in the example with the starlings  with the birds  when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them  that actually waves of panic can propagate  sending messages over great distances. You'll see    let's see  it's coming up possibly at the very end    maybe not. Information can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism. Yes  it's happening here. See if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm. It's beautiful. The birds are  we sort of understand  we think  from that computer model  what's going on. As I say  it's just those three simple rules  plus the one about watch out for predators. There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this. We don't  however  really understand at a mathematical level. I'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better. I mean  I showed you a computer model  but a computer is not understanding. A computer is  in a way  just another experiment. We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand  you know  exactly where this organization comes from. How do the rules give rise to the patterns  There is one case that we have begun to understand better  and it's the case of fireflies. If you see fireflies in North America  like so many North American sorts of things  they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other. They each do their own thing  flashing on and off  paying no attention to their neighbors. But in Southeast Asia    places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo    there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies. You can see it every night along the river banks. The trees  mangrove trees  are filled with fireflies communicating with light. Specifically  it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together  in perfect synchrony  to reinforce a message to the females. And the message  as you can imagine  is  Come hither. Mate with me.  In a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame. Then on  and then off    a   th of a second  there. And then watch this whole river bank  and watch how precise the synchrony is. On  more on and then off. The combined light from these beetles    these are actually tiny beetles    is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning. For a long time it was not believed when the first Western travelers  like Sir Francis Drake  went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle. No one believed them. We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West. And for a long time  even after it was documented  it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion. Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it  or  you know  a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none. But I hope you've convinced yourself now  with this nighttime video  that they really were very well synchronized. Okay  well  the issue then is  do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order  and I've already hinted that the answer is no. Well  you don't have to be a whole creature. You can even be just a single cell. Like  take  for instance  your pacemaker cells in your heart right now. They're keeping you alive. Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region  the sinoatrial node  which has about        independent cells that would each beep  have an electrical rhythm    a voltage up and down    to send a signal to the ventricles to pump. Now  your pacemaker is not a single cell. It's this democracy of        cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly. I don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea. If you have epilepsy  there is an instance of billions of brain cells  or at least millions  discharging in pathological concert. So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing. You don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell. If you look  for instance  at how lasers work  that would be a case of atomic synchrony. In a laser  what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent    many different colors and different frequencies  sort of like the way you clapped initially    but if you were a laser  it would be rhythmic applause. It would be all atoms pulsating in unison  emitting light of one color  one frequency. Now comes the very risky part of my talk  which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize. Hold your breath for me. What I have here are two empty water bottles. This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick. This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles. I have some metronomes here. Can you hear that  All right  so  I've got a metronome  and it's the world's smallest metronome  the    well  I shouldn't advertise. Anyway  so this is the world's smallest metronome. I've set it on the fastest setting  and I'm going to now take another one set to the same setting. We can try this first. If I just put them on the table together  there's no reason for them to synchronize  and they probably won't. Maybe you'd better listen to them. I'll stand here. What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same. Right  They did. They were in sync for a while  but then they drifted apart. And the reason is that they're not able to communicate. Now  you might think that's a bizarre idea. How can metronomes communicate  Well  they can communicate through mechanical forces. So I'm going to give them a chance to do that. I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate  I'm going to put them on a movable platform  which is the  Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell.  Okay  So here it is. Let's see if we can get this to work. My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over. All right. So there we go. Let's see. OK  I'm not trying to cheat    let me start them out of sync. No  hard to even do that. All right. So before any one goes out of sync  I'll just put those right there. Now  that might seem a bit whimsical  but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order sometimes has unexpected consequences. And a clear case of that  was something that happened in London in the year     . The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London    a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames  first river crossing in over     years in London. There was a big competition for the design of this bridge  and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team    in the TED spirit  actually    of an architect    perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom  Lord Norman Foster    working with an artist  a sculptor  Sir Anthony Caro  and an engineering firm  Ove Arup. And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision  which was    he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books  and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss  he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber. He would shoot his light saber across the abyss  making a blade of light  and then scamper across on this blade of light. He said   That's the vision I want to give to London. I want a blade of light across the Thames.  So they built the blade of light  and it's a very thin ribbon of steel  the world's    probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is  with cables that are out on the side. You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top. These cables were on the side of the bridge  like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames    that's what's holding up this bridge. Now  everyone was very excited to try it out. On opening day  thousands of Londoners came out  and something happened. And within two days the bridge was closed to the public. So I want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day  who will describe what happened. Man  It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down  rather like being on the boat. Woman  Yeah  it felt unstable  and it was very windy  and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides  so you could definitely    there was something going on sideways  it felt  maybe. Interviewer  Not up and down  Boy  No. Interviewer  And not forwards and backwards  Boy  No. Interviewer  Just sideways. About how much was it moving  do you think  Boy  It was about    Interviewer  I mean  that much  or this much  Boy  About the second one. Interviewer  This much  Boy  Yeah. Man  It was at least six  six to eight inches  I would have thought. Interviewer  Right  so  at least this much  Man  Oh  yes. Woman  I remember wanting to get off. Interviewer  Oh  did you  Woman  Yeah. It felt odd. Interviewer  So it was enough to be scary  Woman  Yeah  but I thought that was just me. Interviewer  Ah  Now  tell me why you had to do this  Boy  We had to do this because  to keep in balance because if you didn't keep your balance  then you would just fall over about  like  to the left or right  about    degrees. Interviewer  So just show me how you walk normally. Right. And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right. So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and    oh  and short steps  Man  That's right. And it seemed obvious to me that it was probably the number of people on it. Interviewer  Were they deliberately walking in step  or anything like that  Man  No  they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge. Steven Strogatz  All right  so that already gives you a hint of what happened. Think of the bridge as being like this platform. Think of the people as being like metronomes. Now  you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome  but after all  we do walk like    I mean  we oscillate back and forth as we walk. And especially if we start to walk like those people did  right  They all showed this strange sort of skating gait that they adopted once the bridge started to move. And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge. But also  after you see the bridge on opening day  you'll see an interesting clip of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie  who figured out what happened on the bridge  and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was. It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move  that engineers knew nothing about. Actually  I think the first person you'll see is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay. Interviewer  Right. So it was quite small    Engineer  Yes. Interviewer     but real  Engineer  Absolutely. Interviewer  You thought   Oh  bother.  Engineer  I felt I was disappointed about it. We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge  and we'd analyzed it  we'd checked it to codes    to heavier loads than the codes    and here it was doing something that we didn't know about. Interviewer  You didn't expect. Engineer  Exactly. Narrator  The most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd    hundreds of people    apparently rocking from side to side in unison  not only with each other  but with the bridge. This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge. But how could the crowd become synchronized  Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect  This was to be the focus of the investigation. Interviewer  Well  at last the simulated bridge is finished  and I can make it wobble. Now  Allan  this is all your fault  isn't it  Allan McRobie  Yes. Interviewer  You designed this  yes  this simulated bridge  and this  you reckon  mimics the action of the real bridge  AM  It captures a lot of the physics  yes. Interviewer  Right. So if we get on it  we should be able to wobble it  yes  Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me  suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge    provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length. AM  This one's only a couple of tons  so it's fairly easy to get going. Just by walking. Interviewer  Well  it's certainly going now. AM  It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go. Interviewer  It's actually quite difficult to walk. You have to be careful where you put your feet down  don't you  because if you get it wrong  it just throws you off your feet. AM  It certainly affects the way you walk  yes. You can't walk normally on it. Interviewer  No. If you try and put one foot in front of another  it's moving your feet away from under you. AM  Yes. Interviewer  So you've got to put your feet out sideways. So already  the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge. AM  ... ice skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking. Interviewer  For a more convincing experiment  I wanted my own opening day crowd  the sound check team. Their instructions  just walk normally. It's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it. They're all having some difficulty walking. And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step. But then  of course  everyone is driving the bridge. You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step  and therefore to drive it to move further. SS  All right  well  with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks  maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over. But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way  to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you. It's amazing  when you meet a head of state and you say   What is your most precious natural resource      they will not say children at first. And then when you say children  they will pretty quickly agree with you. the Minister of Defense of Colombia  head of the army and the head of the police  and we're dropping off     laptops today to children who have no television  no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past    years. The importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC  the guerrillas that started off    years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement. There are one billion children in the world  and    percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school. And in some countries    let me pick Afghanistan       percent of the little girls don't go to school. And I don't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade    they don't go. So in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype  it's gone from an idea to a real laptop. We have half a million laptops today in the hands of children. We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children  and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment. So  in rough numbers  there are a million laptops. That's smaller than I predicted    I predicted three to    million    but is still a very large number. In Colombia  we have about       laptops. It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working  not the Minister of Education  because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off  in which the people who had been causing  if you will     years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived. And suddenly  the kids have connected laptops. They've leapfrogged. The change is absolutely monumental  because it's not just opening it up  but it's opening it up to the rest of the world. So yes  they're building roads  yes  they're putting in telephone  yes  there will be television. But the kids six to    years old are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages  so the children grow up with access to information  with a window into the rest of the world. Before  they were closed off. Interestingly enough  in other countries  it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth. And that engine is going to see the results in    years. It's not going to happen  you know  in one year  but it's an important  deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children. Thirty one countries in total are involved  and in the case of Uruguay  half the children already have them  and by the middle of       every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop    a little green laptop. Now what are some of the results  Some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much  and reading comprehension measured by third parties    not by us    skyrockets. Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents. They own the laptops. They take them home. And so when I met with three children from the schools  who had traveled all day to come to Bogota  one of the three children brought her mother. And the reason she brought her mother is that this six year old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write. Her mother had not gone to primary school. And this is such an inversion  and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change. So now  in closing  people say  now why laptops  Laptops are a luxury  it's like giving them iPods. No. The reason you want laptops is that the word is education  not laptop. This is an education project  not a laptop project. They need to learn learning. And then  just think    they can have  let's say      books. In a village  you have     laptops  each with a different set of     books  and so that village suddenly has        books. You and I didn't have        books when we went to primary school. Sometimes school is under a tree  or in many cases  the teacher has only a fifth grade education  so you need a collaborative model of learning  not just building more schools and training more teachers  which you have to do anyway. So we're once again doing  Give One  Get One.  Last year  we ran a  Give One  Get One  program  and it generated over         laptops that we were then able to give free. And by being a zero dollar laptop  we can go to countries that can't afford it at all. And that's what we did. We went to Haiti  we went to Rwanda  Afghanistan  Ethiopia  Mongolia. Places that are not markets  seeding it with the principles of saturation  connectivity  low ages  etc. And then we can actually roll out large numbers. So think of it this way  think of it as inoculating children against ignorance. And think of the laptop as a vaccine. You don't vaccinate a few children. You vaccinate all the children in an area. There are more Chinese restaurants in this country than McDonald's  Burger King  Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's  combined            actually. Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history  as a matter of fact. The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington  D.C.  which unfortunately is closed now  and about to be turned into Walgreen's. And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok 'n Roll  on H Street in Washington. And it's not completely gratuitous  because wok and roll    Chinese food and Japanese foods  so it kind of works out. And Americans love their Chinese food so much they've actually brought it into space. NASA  for example  serves thermal stabilized sweet and sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts. So  let me present the question to you  If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie  you should ask yourself  how often do you eat apple pie  versus how often do you eat Chinese food. Right  And if you think about it  a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese  for example  beef with broccoli  egg rolls  General Tso's Chicken  fortune cookies  chop suey  the take out boxes. For example  I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China  gave them to Chinese to see how they would react. What is this  Should I try it  Try it  What is it called  Fortune cookie. There's a piece of paper inside  What is this  You've won a prize  What is this  It's a fortune  Tasty  So  where are they from  The short answer is  actually  they're from Japan. And in Kyoto  outside  there are still small family run bakeries that make fortune cookies  as they did over     years ago     years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States. If you see them side by side  there's yellow and brown. Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste  so they're not as sweet as our version. So  how did they get to the United States  Well  the short answer is  the Japanese immigrants came over  and a bunch of the bakers introduced them    including at least one in Los Angeles  and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo do  which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan. They back then  actually  made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto. So  the interesting question is  how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese  Well  the short answer is  we locked up all the Japanese during World War II  including those that made fortune cookies  so that's the time when the Chinese moved in  kind of saw a market opportunity and took over. So  fortune cookies  invented by the Japanese  popularized by the Chinese  but ultimately consumed by Americans. They are more American than anything else. Another one of my favorite dishes  General Tso's Chicken    which  by the way  in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso's Chicken. I love this dish. The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso  and he has marched very far indeed  because he is sweet  he is fried  and he is chicken    all things that Americans love. He has marched so far  actually  that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it  he's kind of horrified. He's in Taiwan right now. He's retired  deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong. So  he    after this I showed him  he got up  and he's like   Mominqimiao   which means   This is all nonsense   and goes back to play his Mahjong game during the afternoon. So  another dish. One of my favorites. Beef with broccoli. Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable  in fact  it is originally an Italian vegetable. It was introduced into the United States in the     s  but became popularized in the     s and the     s. In fact  the Chinese had their own version of broccoli  which is called Chinese broccoli  but right now  what    they've now discovered American broccoli  and are importing it as a  sort of  exotic delicacy. I guarantee you  General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life    and indeed  that actually was a picture of General Tso. I went to his home town. This is a billboard that says   Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso.  And I went looking for chicken. Finally found a cow    and did find chicken. Believe it or not  these guys were actually crossing the road. And       I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the little town. This guy is now five generations removed from the General  this guy is about seven. Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you  and they're like  we don't know this dish. And then they're like  is this Chinese food  Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them. But they weren't kind of surprised I traveled around the world to visit them  because in their eyes he is  after all  a famous Qing dynasty military hero. He played an important role in the Taiping rebellion  which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God and the baby brother of Jesus Christ. And caused the war that killed    million people    still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day. So  you know  I realized when I was there  General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America  in that he's known for chicken and not war. But in China  this guy's actually known for war and not chicken. But the granddaddy of all the Chinese American dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey  which was introduced around the turn of the   th century. And according to New York Times  in       there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town  and  the city has gone 'chop suey' mad.  So it took about    years before the Americans realized that  whoa  chop suey is actually not known in China. And as this article points out   The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey.  You know  back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan  if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl  you could take her out on a chop suey date. I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another  because chop suey  if you translate into Chinese  means tsap sui  which  if you translate back  means  odds and ends.  So  these people are going around China asking for chop suey  which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying  I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called  leftovers   and it is particularly       right  And not only that  this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving. So  why    why and where    did chop suey come from  Let's go back to mid     s when the Chinese first came to America. Now back then  the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food. In fact  they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien. These people weren't eating dogs    they were eating cats    and they weren't eating cats    they were eating rats. In fact  The New York Times  my esteemed employer  in      ran an article that asked   Do Chinese eat rats   And not the most PC question to be asked today  but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time  not so outlandish. This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late     s  and if you see  under the word  Clears     very small    it says   They must go   which refers not only to the rats  but to the Chinese in their midst  because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us. And another way that you saw  sort of  this sort of  this antipathy towards the Chinese is through documents like this. This is actually in the Library of Congress  it is a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers  hero of our American labor movement  and it's called   Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion  Meat versus Rice  American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism  Which shall survive  And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat. And as a matter of fact  then  this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So  with sentiments like these  the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between      and       the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity. So  in a way  because the Chinese were attacked  chop suey was created as a defense mechanism. Now  who came up with the idea of chop suey  There's a lot of different mysteries  a lot of different legends  but of the ones that I've found that I thought was most interesting is this article from     . A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown  New York City  and says  I want you guys all to stop making chop suey  because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey. And the way that he tells it  there was a guy  there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up  and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could  quote   pass  as Chinese. And as he said    we would never print this today    but basically  the American man has become very rich. Lem Sen  who's this guy  I would have made this money  too  but I've spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe. Now I've come and found him  and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop making chop suey  or pay me for the right to do the same. So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights. So the thing is  this kind of idea of Chinese American food doesn't exist only in America. In fact  if you think about it  Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet  served on all seven continents  even Antarctica  because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station  which is the main scientific station in Antarctica. So  you see different varieties of Chinese food. For example  there is French Chinese food  where they serve salt and pepper frog legs. There is Italian Chinese food  where they don't have fortune cookies  so they serve fried gelato. My downstairs neighbor  Alessandra  was completely shocked when I told her   Dude  fried gelato is not Chinese.  She's like   It's not  But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy.  And even the Brits have their own version. This is a dish called crispy shredded beef  which has a lot of crisp  a lot of shred  and not a lot of beef. There is West Indian Chinese food  there's Jamaican Chinese food  there is Middle Eastern Chinese food  there's Mauritian Chinese food. This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered. There's Indian Chinese food  Korean Chinese food  Japanese Chinese food  where they take the bao  the little buns  and they make them into pizza versions  and they take    and they    like  totally randomly they'll take Chinese noodle dishes  and they'll just Ramen ize them. This is  like  this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup. So  there's Peruvian Chinese food  which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food  where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas. And then    one thing  they have things like risotto chop suey. My personal favorite of all the restaurants I've encountered around the world was this one in Brazil  called  Kung Food.  So  let's take a step back  and kind of  understand what is to be appreciated in America. McDonald's has  sort of  garnered a lot of attention  a lot of respect  for basically standardizing the menu  d cor and dining experience in post World War II America. But you know what  They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois  right  Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing  I would argue  with the menu and the d cor    even the restaurant name    but without a centralized headquarters. So  this actually became very clear to me with the March          Powerball drawing  where  you know  they expected  based on the number of ticket sales they had  to have three or four second place winners    those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers. Instead  they had      and they were completely shocked. They looked all across the country  and discovered it couldn't necessarily be fraud  because it happened  you know  in different states  across different computer systems. So whatever it was  it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way. So  like  OK  maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper    you know  like  it was a diamond  or  you know  diagonal. It wasn't that. It wasn't that  so they're like  OK  let's look at television  so they looked at an episode of  Lost.  Now  I don't have a TV  which makes me a freak  but very productive  and       and this episode of  Lost   I understand  where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number  which was how long they'd been on the island  but they looked  and the numbers did not match. So they looked at  The Young and The Restless   and it wasn't that  either. So  it wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day  and they ask him   Where did you get your number from   He's like   Oh  I got it from a fortune cookie.  This actually is a slip that one of the winners had  because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like  oh  no    like  this can't be true. But it was true  and basically  of those     people  and     of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie. Yeah. So  I went and started looking. I went across the country  looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from. You know  there are a bunch of them  including Lee's China in Omaha    which is actually run by Koreans  but that's another point    and a bunch of them named China Buffet. So  what's interesting is that their stories were similar  but they were different. It was lunch  it was take out  it was sit down  it was buffet  it was three weeks ago  it was three months ago. But at some point  all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a Chinese restaurant  and all these Chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies  which  of course we know aren't even Chinese to begin with. So it's kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self organization  right  where  like in ant colonies  where little decisions made by    on the micro level actually have a big impact on the macro level. So  a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets. McDonald's actually spent    years coming out with a chicken like product. They did chicken pot pie  they did fried chicken  and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets. And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them  because that's kind of an easy concept  but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was  they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost effective manner  which is why it took so long for other people to copy them. It took    years  and then within a couple of months  it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of McDonald's in the country. In contrast  we have General Tso's Chicken  which actually started in New York City in the early     s  as I was also starting in the university in New York City in the early     s  so ... And this logo  So me  General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related. But that dish also took about    years to spread across America from a random restaurant in New York City. Someone's like  oh  God    it's sweet  it's fried  it's chicken  Americans will love this. So  what I like to say  you know  this being sort of Bay Area  Silicon Valley    is that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of the dining experiences. We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux  sort of an open source thing  right  where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system  that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food  you know  depending on the region. For example  you know  in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food  where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish  right  And in Philadelphia  you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll  which looks like an egg roll on the outside  but a cheesesteak on the inside. I was really surprised to discover that  not only in Philadelphia  but also in Atlanta  because what had happened was that a Chinese family had moved from Atlanta to    sorry  from Philadelphia to Atlanta  and brought that with them. So  the thing is  our historical lore  because of the way we like narratives  are full of vast characters such as  you know  Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald's and Asa Chandler with Coca Cola. But  you know  it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters    oops    for example  like Lem Sen  who introduced chop suey  Chef Peng  who introduced General Tso Chicken  and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies. So  the point of my presentation is to make you think twice  that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much  if not more  impact on what we eat today. So. Thank you very much.
