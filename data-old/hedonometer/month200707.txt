How many Creationists do we have in the room  Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians. And yet many Darwinians are anxious  a little uneasy    would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes. It's all right. You know spiderwebs  Sure  they are products of evolution. The World Wide Web  Not so sure. Beaver dams  yes. Hoover Dam  no. What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves  fruits of the tree of life  and hence  in some sense  obeying evolutionary rules  And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking    to our thinking. And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that  keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here. So you're out in the woods  or you're out in the pasture  and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass. It climbs up to the top  and it falls  and it climbs  and it falls  and it climbs    trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass. What is this ant doing  What is this in aid of  What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass  What's in it for the ant  And the answer is  nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant. Well then  why is it doing this  Is it just a fluke  Yeah  it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke. It's a little brain worm. It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle. Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds  and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant  crawl into its brain  and drive it up a blade of grass like an all terrain vehicle. So there's nothing in it for the ant. The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain  inducing suicidal behavior. Pretty scary. Well  does anything like that happen with human beings  This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness  of course. Well  it may already have occurred to you that Islam means  surrender   or  submission of self interest to the will of Allah.  Well  it's ideas    not worms    that hijack our brains. Now  am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas  No  it's worse than that. Most people have. There are a lot of ideas to die for. Freedom  if you're from New Hampshire. Justice. Truth. Communism. Many people have laid down their lives for communism  and many have laid down their lives for capitalism. And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam. These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for. They're infectious. Yesterday  Amory Lovins spoke about  infectious repititis.  It was a term of abuse  in effect. This is unthinking engineering. Well  most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant  new  out of the box thinking. It's  infectious repetitis   and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection. Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others. I myself am a philosopher  and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is. And you have to have a bumper sticker  you know. You have to have a statement. So  this is mine. The secret of happiness is  Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it. Most of us    now that the  Me Decade  is well in the past    now we actually do this. One set of ideas or another have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives. This is what our summum bonum is. It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have. Now  this is a profound biological effect. It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests. And no other species does anything at all like it. Well  how are we going to think about this  It is  on the one hand  a biological effect  and a very large one. Unmistakable. Now  what theories do we want to use to look at this  Well  many theories. But how could something tie them together  The idea of replicating ideas  ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain. Richard Dawkins  whom you'll be hearing later in the day  invented the term  memes   and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book  The Selfish Gene.  Now here am I talking about his idea. Well  you see  it's not his. Yes    he started it. But it's everybody's idea now. And he's not responsible for what I say about memes. I'm responsible for what I say about memes. Actually  I think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas  but for their likely misuses. So it is important  I think  to Richard  and to me  that these ideas not be abused and misused. They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous. And it's just about a full time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another. So we have to keep plugging away  trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread. But it is a problem. We don't have much time  and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out  because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said. So let me just point out  memes are like viruses. That's what Richard said  back in '  . And you might think   Well  how can that be  I mean  a virus is    you know  it's stuff  What's a meme made of   Yesterday  Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but    what's a virus  A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude. That is  there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does. And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude. What's a meme made of  What are bits made of  Mom  Not silicon. They're made of information  and can be carried in any physical medium. What's a word made of  Sometimes when people say   Do memes exist   I say   Well  do words exist  Are they in your ontology   If they are  words are memes that can be pronounced. Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced. There are different species of memes. Remember the Shakers  Gift to be simple  Simple  beautiful furniture  And  of course  they're basically extinct now. And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker dom is that one should be celibate. Not just the priests. Everybody. Well  it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct.  Laughter  But in fact that's not why they went extinct. They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there. And there were lots of widows and orphans  people like that  who needed a foster home. And so they had a ready supply of converts. And they could keep it going. And  in principle  it could've gone on forever  with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts. The idea being passed on through proselytizing  instead of through the gene line. So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they're not being passed on genetically. A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness. After all  the meme for Shaker dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite. There are other parasites that do this    which render the host sterile. It's part of their plan. They don't have to have minds to have a plan. I'm just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective  which I recommend. I've not time to go into more of it. In Jared Diamond's wonderful book   Guns  Germs and Steel   he talks about how it was germs  more than guns and steel  that conquered the new hemisphere    the Western hemisphere    that conquered the rest of the world. When European explorers and travelers spread out  they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to  that they had learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years  thousands of years  of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens. And they just wiped out    these pathogens just wiped out the native people  who had no immunity to them at all. And we're doing it again. We're doing it this time with toxic ideas. Yesterday  a number of people    Nicholas Negroponte and others    spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out  thanks to all the new technology all over the world. And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful. But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology  are a lot of toxic ideas. Now  this has been realized for some time. Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam  one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.  One has only to glance at its press films  fashion shows  beauty contests  ballrooms  wine bars and broadcasting stations.  Memes. These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures. They are wiping out languages. They are wiping out traditions and practices. And it's not our fault  anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity. We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture. We're a free society  so we let pornography and all these things    we shrug them off. They're like a mild cold. They're not a big deal for us. But we should recognize that for many people in the world  they are a big deal. And we should be very alert to this. As we spread our education and our technology  one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes    the memes that they are prepared to die for. Well now  how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes  That is not the job of the science of memetics. Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be. This is not the place for hate and anger. If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS  then you hate HIV. But the way to deal with that is to do science  and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective. Get the facts. Work out the implications. There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do. And  as with germs  the trick is not to try to annihilate them. You will never annihilate the germs. What you can do  however  is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence. That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties. That's all the time I have  so thank you very much for your attention. I'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope. When we go to the physician today    when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in  there are words that we just don't want to hear. There are words that we're truly afraid of. Diabetes  cancer  Parkinson's  Alzheimer's  heart failure  lung failure    things that we know are debilitating diseases  for which there's relatively little that can be done. And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease  why it's important  why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn't  and where we are clinically today  and where we might go tomorrow  and what some of the hurdles are. And we're going to do all of that in    minutes  I promise. I want to start with this slide  because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it. This was an issue from      that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human. It was basically a regenerative medicine issue. Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand. It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale. So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there. We know that if we have a damaged hip  you can put an artificial hip in. And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover. This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine. This is not regenerative medicine. Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago. The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like    and I'll come back to that theme a few times    instead of doing that  we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue. So that at the end of the treatment  you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment. Very few good ideas    if you agree that this is a good idea    very few good ideas are truly novel. And this is just the same. If you look back in history  Charles Lindbergh  who was better known for flying airplanes  was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel  one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller  to begin to think about  could you culture organs  And they published this book in       where they actually began to think about  what could you do in bio reactors to grow whole organs  We've come a long way since then. I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on. But before doing that  what I'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you. Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life  and reducing poverty  and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe. One of the challenges is that the richer we are  the longer we live. And the longer we live  the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older. This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of   . And you can basically see that the richer a country is  the older the people are within it. Why is this important  And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now  If the average age of your population is     then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again  maybe a little bit of asthma. If the average age in your country is    to     now the average person is looking at diabetes  early onset diabetes  heart failure  coronary artery disease    things that are inherently more difficult to treat  and much more expensive to treat. Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here. This is from  The Untied States of America.  In       there were    workers per retiree.    people who were basically outside of being really sick  paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease. In       two workers per retiree in the U.S. And this is matched in every industrialized  wealthy country in the world. How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this  This is age versus cost of health care. And you can see that right around age        to     there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care. It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies  you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care  plotted over your lifetime. And about seven years before you're about to die  there's a spike. And you can actually       we won't get into that. There are very few things  very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging. I'd suggest there are four things  and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system. All those things do is change who pays. They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is. One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care. We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing. You can prevent. Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention. But perhaps most interesting  to me anyway  and most important  is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression  and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom. Think of it in terms of diabetes  for instance. Today  with diabetes  what do we do  We diagnose the disease eventually  once it becomes symptomatic  and then we treat the symptom for                years. And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy. But eventually it stops working  and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease. Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease  perhaps even before it was symptomatic  And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it  but if it worked  we would truly be able to do something different. This video  I think  gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically. This is a newt re growing its limb. If a newt can do this kind of thing  why can't we  I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment. But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body  for tissues and for organs themselves. So today's reality is that if we get sick  the message is we will treat your symptoms  and you need to adjust to a new way of life. I would pose to you that tomorrow    and when tomorrow is we could debate  but it's within the foreseeable future    we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation. There's a limb prosthetic up here  similar actually one on the soldier that's come back from Iraq. There are     soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs. Imagine if instead of facing that  they could actually face the regeneration of that limb. It's a wild concept. I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept. But it's applicable  again  to every organ system. How can we do that  The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body. We need to learn to speak the body's language. And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus. A mammalian fetus  if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy  will re grow that limb. So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms. It's a natural process  but it is lost as we age. In a child  before the age of about six months  if they lose their fingertip in an accident  they'll re grow their fingertip. By the time they're five  they won't be able to do that anymore. So to engage in that conversation with the body  we need to speak the body's language. And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today. I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body. The first is cellular therapies. Clearly  we heal ourselves in a natural process  using cells to do most of the work. Therefore  if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body  they may do the healing. Secondly  we can use materials. We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials. If we can invent materials  design materials  or extract materials from a natural environment  then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself. And finally  we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal. I'm going to show you an example of each of these  and I'm going to start with materials. Steve Badylak    who's at the University of Pittsburgh    about a decade ago had a remarkable idea. And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig  if you threw away all the cells  and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active  may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself. And he asked a very important question. He asked the question  if I take that material  which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine  and I place it somewhere else on a person's body  would it give a tissue specific response  or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear  I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling. The picture I'm about to show you is a compelling picture. However  for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish    even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends    the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet  check your Blackberry  do anything other than look at the screen. What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer. And although    it's good to laugh before we look at this. This is the reality of diabetes. I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics  diabetic ulcers  we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment  which is amputation  if you can't heal it. So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long. This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic. The treatment for this is amputation. This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes  and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact. And this lady decided  after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer  that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented. That's what the wound looked like    weeks later. That material contained only natural signals. And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before. There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you    I'll let you know when you can look again. This is a horse. The horse is not in pain. If the horse was in pain  I wouldn't show you this slide. The horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident. Just a few weeks after treatment    in this case  taking that material  turning it into a gel  and packing that area  and then repeating the treatment a few times    and the horse heals up. And if you took an ultrasound of that area  it would look great. Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re attached. There are now         patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds. Could you regenerate a limb  DARPA just gave Steve    million dollars to lead an eight institution project to begin the process of asking that question. And I'll show you the    million dollar picture. This is a    year old man who's lost the end of his fingertip. Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips. After treatment that's what it looks like. This is happening today. This is clinically relevant today. There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches. But could you go a little further  Could you  say  instead of using material  can I take some cells along with the material  and remove a damaged piece of tissue  put a bio degradable material on there  You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish. This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital. He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish. He chills the dish  it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish. It's the coolest stuff. Now I'm going to show you cell based regeneration. And what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient. Again  if you're squeamish  you don't want to watch. But this one's kind of cool. So this is a bypass operation  just like what Al Gore had  with a difference. In this case  at the end of the bypass operation  you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient. And I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is. Here go the stem cells  right into the beating heart of the patient. And if you look really carefully  it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back flush. You see the cells coming back out. We need all sorts of new technology  new devices  to get the cells to the right place at the right time. Just a little bit of data  a tiny bit of data. This was a randomized trial. At this time this was an N of   . Now there's an N of about    . Basically  if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass  they get a little bit better. If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass  for these particular patients  they became asymptomatic. These are now two years out. The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early  and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state. This is the same procedure  but now done minimally invasively  with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure. There go the cells. We don't have time to go into all of those details  but basically  that works too. You can take patients who are less sick  and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy. Here's another example of stem cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet  but I think very soon will be. This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh  along with a number of colleagues around the world. They've decided that liposuction fluid  which    in the United States  we have a lot of liposuction fluid. It's a great source of stem cells. Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid. So you could go in  you could get your tummy tuck. Out comes the liposuction fluid  and in this case  the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons. All done in the lab. And I think fairly soon  you will see patients being treated with their own fat derived  or adipose derived  stem cells. I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease. Here's just one example before I close up. This is equally tragic. We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army  who have to treat the now        kids that have come back from Iraq. Many of those patients are very severely burned. And if there's anything that's been learned about burn  it's that we don't know how to treat it. Everything that is done to treat burn    basically we do a sodding approach. We make something over here  and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound  and we try and get the two to take. In this case here  a new  wearable bio reactor has been designed    it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR    by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh. And that bio reactor will lay down in the wound bed. The gun that you see there sprays cells. That's going to spray cells over that area. The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment  deliver other things as well at the same time  and therefore we will seed that lawn  as opposed to try the sodding approach. It's a completely different way of doing it. So my    minutes is up. So let me finish up with some good news  and maybe a little bit of bad news. The good news is that this is happening today. It's very powerful work. Clearly the images kind of get that across. It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter disciplinary. Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen. A number of governments  and a number of regions  have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease. The Japanese government were perhaps the first  when they decided to invest first   billion  later another   billion in this field. It's no coincidence. Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age. They need this to work or their health system dies. So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area. The European Union  same thing. China  the same thing. China just launched a national tissue engineering center. The first year budget was     million US dollars. In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach. Oh  for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president. We've had a different approach. And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along. But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way. And I'm going to finish up with a quote  maybe a little cheap shot  at the director of the NIH  who's a very charming man. Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago  to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that   .  billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it  in a strategic way  to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients. And at the end of a very testy meeting  what the NIH director said was   Your vision is larger than our appetite.  I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision  but together we can change his appetite. Thank you. So I really consider myself a storyteller. But I don't really tell stories in the usual way  in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories. Instead  I'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories  people all around the world. I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common. I think people are very similar  but I also think that we have trouble seeing that. You know  as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps  and I think we all see a lot of gaps. And we define ourselves by our gaps. There's language gaps  there's ethnicity and racial gaps  there's age gaps  there's gender gaps  there's sexuality gaps  there's wealth and money gaps  there's education gaps  there's also religious gaps. You know  we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something  some smaller community. But I think that actually  despite our gaps  we really have a lot in common. And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves. I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new. But the thing about self expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen. This  also  is nothing new. Since the dawn of human history  we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art  writing poems  singing songs  scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper  gossiping with friends. This is nothing new. What's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities  these acts of self expression  have been moving onto the Internet. And as that's happened  people have been leaving behind footprints  footprints that tell stories of their moments of self expression. And so what I do is  I write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints  and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them    what they feel  what they think  what's different in the world today than usual  these sorts of questions. One project that explores these ideas  which was made about a year ago  is a piece called We Feel Fine. This is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world's newly posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases  I feel  or  I am feeling.  And when it finds one of those phrases  it grabs the sentence up to the period  and then automatically tries to deduce the age  gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence. Then  knowing the geographical location and the time  we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence. All of this information is saved in a database that collects about        feelings a day. It's been running for about a year and a half. It's reached about seven and a half million human feelings now. And I'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine. What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles  each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours. The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside    so that happy  positive feelings are brightly colored. And sad  negative feelings are darkly colored. The diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside  so that the large dots contain large sentences  and the small dots contain small sentences. Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here   I would just feel so much better if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips.  So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions. And all of these are stated by people   I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much  but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond  it's nice to feel bigger again.  The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics  and they swarm wildly around  kind of exploring the world of life. And then they also exhibit curiosity. You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now. You can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words. Those six words represent the six movements of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness. There's also Murmurs  Montage  Mobs  Metrics and Mounds. And I'll walk you through a few of those now. Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling. And then  one by one  in reverse chronological order  they excuse themselves  entering the scrolling list of feelings.  I feel a bit better now.   I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do.   I feel gypped out of something awesome here.   I feel so free  I feel so good.   I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of.  And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected. And in that way  you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy. The next movement is called Montage. Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid. This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings in the last few hours  if you will. Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up. We see   I just feel like I'm not going to have fun if it's not the both of us.  That was from someone in Michigan. We see   I feel like I have been at a computer all day.  These are automatically constructed using the found objects   I think I feel a little full.  The next movement is called mobs. Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours. We see that  better  is the most frequent feeling right now  followed by  good    bad    guilty    right    down    sick  and so on. We can also get a gender breakdown. And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men. We can do an age breakdown  which gives us a histogram of the world's emotional distribution by age. We see people in their twenties are the most prolific  followed by teenagers  and then people in their thirties  and it dies out very quickly from there. In weather  the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent  so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they're part of the sun. The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze. The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm  and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground. Finally  location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings. Metrics provides more numerical views on the data. We see that the world is feeling  used  at  .  times the normal level right now. They're feeling  warm  at  .  times the normal level  and so on. Other views are also available. Here are gender  age  weather  location. The final movement is called Mounds. It's a bit different from the others. Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large  gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle. And if I hold down my cursor  they do a little dance. We see  better  is the most frequent feeling  followed by  bad.  And then if I go over here  the list begins to scroll  and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected. You can see the little pink cursor moving along  representing our position. Here we see people that feel  slipping    nauseous    responsible.  There's also a search capability  if you're interested in finding out about a certain population. For instance  you could find women who feel  addicted  in their   s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh. But I'll spare you that. So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected   I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me.   I feel very lonely.   I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful.   I feel invisible to you.   I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to.   I feel in love with Carolyn.   I feel so naughty.   I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life.   I love how I feel today.  So as you can see  We Feel Fine uses a technique that I call  passive observation.  What I mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs and looks at what people are writing  and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed. And because of that  you end up getting very honest  candid  sincere responses that are often very moving. And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work because people don't know they're being interviewed. They're just living life  and they end up just acting like that. Another technique is directly questioning people. And this is a technique that I explored in a different project  the Yahoo  Time Capsule  which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in     . It was divided into ten very simple themes    love  anger  sadness and so on    each of which contained a single  very open ended question put to the world  What do you love  What makes you angry  What makes you sad  What do you believe in  And so on. The time capsule was available for one month online  translated into    languages  and this is what it looked like. It's a spinning globe  the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule. The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule. You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted. This is in response to  What's beautiful   Miss World.  There are two modes to the time capsule. There's One World  which presents the spinning globe  and Many Voices  which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one. So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event  which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo  where for three consecutive nights  the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls  which stand about     feet tall. It was really incredible. And we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a    watt laser into outer space. You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a    degree angle there. This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier    the differences in age  gender and wealth and so on. But  you know  as I looked at this more and more and more  and saw these images go across the rocks  I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again. You know  weddings  births  funerals  the first car  the first kiss  the first camel or horse    depending on the culture. And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away  where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space. And there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky. And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky  and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories. You know  as a child in Vermont  on a farm where I grew up  I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion  the Hunter. And as an adult  I've been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night. You know  Orion facing the roaring bull. Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda. Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus. I mean  these are the great tales of the Greeks. And it caused me to wonder about our world today. And it caused me to wonder specifically  if we could make new constellations today  what would those look like  What would those be  If we could make new pictures in the sky  what would we draw  What are the great stories of today  And those are the questions that inspired my new project  which is debuting here today at TED. Nobody's seen this yet  publicly. It's called Universe  Revealing Our Modern Mythology. And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky. So  it's my great pleasure now to show this to you. So  Universe will open here. And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field  and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background  kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom  and we'll put it down here to red. So you see this kind of    these stars moving along. Now  these aren't just little points of light  little pixels. Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world    a quote that was stated by somebody  an image  a news story  a person  a company. You know  some kind of heroic personality. And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars  that shapes begin to emerge. We see here there's a little man walking along  or maybe a woman. And we see here a photograph with a head. You can start to see words emerging here. And those are the constellations of today. And I can turn them all on  and you can see them moving across the sky now. This is the universe of       the last two months. The data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world. It's using the API of a really great company that I work with in New York  actually  called Daylife. And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months. So we can see where it's emerging here  like President Ford  Iraq  Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words    I call them secrets    and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently. President Ford    this is Gerald Ford's funeral. We can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe  and everything else will enter its orbit. So  we'll click Ford  and now that becomes the center. And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it. We can isolate just the photographs  and we now see those. We can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe. Now the things that relate to it are swirling around. We can click on this and we see this iconic image of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin. In Universe  there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely  and you can just kind of click on stuff. This is a photographic representation  called Snapshots. But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe. So  if we want to  let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like. And let's see  in the past week  what he's been up to. So now  we have a new universe  which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton. We can have his constellations emerge here. We can pull out his secrets  and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates  Hillary  presidential  Barack Obama. We can see the stories that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now. Any of those can be opened up. So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama. You can see that this is an important story  there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up  we get different perspectives on this story. You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera. We can also see the superstars. These would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton  Hillary  Iraq  George Bush  Barack Obama  Scooter Libby    these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton. We can also see a world map  so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so. We can see he's been focused in America because he's been campaigning  probably  but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East. And then we can also see a timeline. So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday  but he was back to work on Sunday morning  and actually been tapering off since then this week. And it's not limited to just people or dates  but we can actually put in concepts also. So if I put in climate change for all of       we'll see what that universe looks like. Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes. Here we have our secrets. So we see again  climate change is large  Nairobi  global conference  environmental. And there are also quotes that you can see  if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change. You know  this is really an infinite thing. The superstars of climate change in       United States  Britain  China. You know  these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept. So this is a piece that demands exploration. This will be online in several days  probably next Tuesday. And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be. You'll notice that in Daylife    rather  in Universe    it supports both the notion of a global mythology  which is represented by something as broad as  say        and also a personal mythology. As you search for the things that are important to you in your world  and then see what the constellations of those might look like. So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much. So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub Saharan Africa. And this is a pretty well educated audience  so I imagine you all know something about AIDS. You probably know that roughly    million people in Africa are infected with the virus  that AIDS is a disease of poverty  and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty  we would decrease AIDS as well. If you know something more  you probably know that Uganda  to date  is the only country in sub Saharan Africa that has had success in combating the epidemic. Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain  be faithful  and use condoms    the ABC campaign    they decreased their prevalence in the     s from about    percent to   percent over just a few years. If you follow policy  you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged    billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years  and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic. So today I'm going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic  and I'm actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know. To do that I'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic. And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy. I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices. But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology. And I think in that sense  this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea. Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline to think about problems of another. So we think  first and foremost  AIDS is a policy issue. And probably for most people in this room  that's how you think about it. But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic. It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves  and how people respond to it. I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff  which is really the most important  but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works. And the first thing that I want to talk about  the first thing I think we need to understand is  how do people respond to the epidemic  So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection  and it kills you. So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS  there's a really significant cost of sex. If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana  where the HIV rate is    percent  if you have one more partner this year    a long term partner  girlfriend  mistress    your chance of dying in    years increases by three percentage points. That is a huge effect. And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex. And in fact among gay men in the US we did see that kind of change in the     s. So if we look in this particularly high risk sample  they're being asked   Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months   Over a period from '   to '    that share drops from about    percent to    percent. It's a huge change in a very short period of time. We didn't see anything like that in Africa. So we don't have quite as good data  but you can see here the share of single men having pre marital sex  or married men having extra marital sex  and how that changes from the early '  s to late '  s  and late '  s to early     s. The epidemic is getting worse. People are learning more things about it. We see almost no change in sexual behavior. These are just tiny decreases    two percentage points    not significant. This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this  and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does    as an investment. So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program  it's important to think about how much it costs. It's also important to think about what the benefit is. And one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active. If version    is coming out next week  there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine. But your health decisions are the same. Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie  every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies  that's a costly investment in your health. But how much you want to invest is going to depend on how much longer you expect to live in the future  even if you don't make those investments. AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS. People really like to have sex. But  you know  it has a benefit in terms of future longevity. But life expectancy in Africa  even without AIDS  is really  really low     or    years in a lot of places. I think it's possible  if we think about that intuition  and think about that fact  that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change. But we really need to test that. And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see  do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more  And the way that I'm going to do that is  I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria. So malaria is a disease that kills you. It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa  in addition to a lot of children. And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria. So one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there's less malaria. So that's what this figure shows you. This shows you    in areas with low malaria  medium malaria  high malaria    what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence. If you look at the blue line  the areas with low levels of malaria  you can see in those areas  actually  the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as HIV prevalence goes up. Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some    it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria    actually  it's increasing a little bit  although that's not significant. This is not just through malaria. Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to HIV than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality. There's another risk  and they respond less to this existing risk. So by itself  I think this tells a lot about how people behave. It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa. But it also tells us something about policy. Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa  it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria  in combating poor indoor air quality  in improving maternal mortality rates. Because if you improve those things  then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own. But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before. Education campaigns  like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding  may not be enough  at least not alone. If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own  even if they know everything about the disease  they still may not change their behavior. So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself. People aren't changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in the epidemic. So we're going to need to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective. And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past. The reason that we know that the ABC campaign was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time. In Uganda we see the prevalence went down. We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works. It's not the only place we had any interventions. Other places have tried things  so why don't we look at those places and see what happened to their prevalence  Unfortunately  there's almost no good data on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about     . So if I asked you   Why don't you go and find me the prevalence in Burkina Faso in        You get on Google  you Google  and you find  actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in      are STD patients and pregnant women  which is not a terribly representative group of people. Then if you poked a little more  you looked a little more at what was going on  you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year  because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users. But even worse    some years it's only IV drug users  some years it's only pregnant women. We have no way to figure out what happened over time. We have no consistent testing. Now in the last few years  we actually have done some good testing. In Kenya  in Zambia  and a bunch of countries  there's been testing in random samples of the population. But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge. So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in       but I can't tell you anything about      or     . So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research. And I started thinking about how else might we figure out what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past. And I think that the answer is  we can look at mortality data  and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past. To do this  we're going to have to rely on the fact that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease. It kills people in the prime of their lives. Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here    this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt. Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS  Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS. And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people. That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development. But in this middle region  between    and     the death rates in Botswana are much  much  much higher than in Egypt. But since there are very few other diseases that kill people  we can really attribute that mortality to HIV. But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago  we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past. So it turns out  if you use this technique  actually your estimates of prevalence are very close to what we get from testing random samples in the population  but they're very  very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are. So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS  and prevalence based on the mortality data for the years in the late     s in nine countries in Africa. You can see  almost without exception  the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality based estimates. UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is    percent  and mortality estimates suggest it's only about   percent. And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates. So this is another way to see this. You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says  we have to really see    deaths per        rather than    deaths per        in this age group. I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute about how we can use this kind of information to learn something that's going to help us think about the world. But this also tells us that one of these facts that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right. If you think that    million people are infected  if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high  maybe that's more like    or    million. It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem. But it does suggest that that number might be a little big. What I really want to do  is I want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower. And I said in the beginning  I wasn't going to tell you about exports. When I started working on these projects  I was not thinking at all about economics  but eventually it kind of sucks you back in. So I am going to talk about exports and prices. And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity  in particular export volume  and HIV infections. So obviously  as an economist  I'm deeply familiar with the fact that development  that openness to trade  is really good for developing countries. It's good for improving people's lives. But openness and inter connectedness  it comes with a cost when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise. On Wednesday  I learned from Laurie Garrett that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu  and I wouldn't be at all worried about that if we never had any contact with Asia. And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit. The epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight  who got the disease in Africa and brought it back. And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US. In Africa  epidemiologists have noted for a long time that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people. Areas with a lot of economic activity    with a lot of roads  with a lot of urbanization    those areas have higher prevalence than others. But that actually doesn't mean at all that if we gave people more exports  more trade  that that would increase prevalence. By using this new data  using this information about prevalence over time  we can actually test that. And so it seems to be    fortunately  I think    it seems to be the case that these things are positively related. More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big. So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume  it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections. So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy. From a forecasting perspective  if we know where trade is likely to change  for example  because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act or other policies that encourage trade  we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV. And we can go and we can try to have pre emptive preventive measures there. Likewise  as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports  if we know there's this externality    this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports    we can think about what the right kinds of policies are. But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know. Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS  in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS  it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty    at least in the short run  that improving exports and improving development    it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead to a decline in HIV prevalence. So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times the special case of Uganda  and the fact that it's the only country in sub Saharan Africa with successful prevention. It's been widely heralded. It's been replicated in Kenya  and Tanzania  and South Africa and many other places. But now I want to actually also question that. Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence in Uganda in the     s. It's true that they had an education campaign. But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period. There was a big decline in coffee prices. Coffee is Uganda's major export. Their exports went down a lot in the early     s    and actually that decline lines up really  really closely with this decline in new HIV infections. So you can see that both of these series    the black line is export value  the red line is new HIV infections    you can see they're both increasing. Starting about      they're both going down a lot. And then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade. So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before  it suggests that somewhere between    percent and    percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign. But that's enormously important for policy. We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign. And if it was only    percent as effective as we think that it was  then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead. Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases. Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision. There are tons of other things that we should think about doing. And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things. I hope that in the last    minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS  and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit some of the things that you did know. And I hope that I've convinced you maybe that it's important to understand things about the epidemic in order to think about policy. But more than anything  you know  I'm an academic. And when I leave here  I'm going to go back and sit in my tiny office  and my computer  and my data. And the thing that's most exciting about that is every time I think about research  there are more questions. There are more things that I think that I want to do. And what's really  really great about being here is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very  very different than the questions that I think up myself. And I can't wait to hear about what they are. So thank you very much. I've always wanted to be a cyborg. One of my favorite shows as a kid was  The Six Million Dollar Man   and this is a little bit closer to the     dollar man or so  but    At at any rate. I would normally feel very self conscious and geeky wearing this around  but a few days ago I saw one world renowned statistician swallowing swords on stage here  so I figure it's OK amongst this group. But that's not what I want to talk about today. I want to talk about toys  and the power that I see inherent in them. When I was a kid  I attended Montessori school up to sixth grade in Atlanta  Georgia. And at the time I didn't think much about it  but then later  I realized that that was the high point of my education. From that point on  everything else was pretty much downhill. And it wasn't until later  as I started making games  that    I really actually think of them more as toys. People call me a game designer  but I really think of these things more as toys. But I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods  and the way she went about things  and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly. And she would design these toys  where kids in playing with the toys would actually come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play. And since they discovered those things  it really stuck with them so much more  and also they would experience their own failures  there was a failure based aspect to learning there. It was very important. And so  the games that I do  I think of really more as modern Montessori toys. And I really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles. So a few years ago  I actually started getting very interested in the SETI program. And that's the way I work. I get interested in different kinds of subjects  I dive in  I research them  and then I try to figure out how to craft a toy around that  so that other people can kind of experience the same sense of discovery as I did as I was learning that subject. And it kind of led me to astrobiology  which is the study of possible life in the universe. And then Drake's Equation  which is looking at the probability of life arising on planets  how long it might last  how many planets are out there  stuff like that. And I started looking at how interesting Drake's Equation was  because it spanned all these different subjects    physics  chemistry  sociology  economics  astronomy. And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was  Powers of Ten   Charles and Ray Eames' film. And I started putting those two together and wondering  could I build a toy where kids would kind of trip across all these interesting principles of life  as it exists and as it might go in the future. Things where you might trip across things like the Copernican Principle  the Fermi Paradox  the Anthropic Principle  the origin of life. And so I'm going to show you a toy today that I've been working on  that I think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy. In playing this toy  you kind of    this will bring up philosophical questions in you. This game's called  Spore.  I've been working on it for several years. It's getting pretty close to finished now. It occurs at all these different scales  first of all  from very  very small to very  very large. I'm just going to pop in at the start of the game. And you actually start this game in a drop of water  as a very  very small single cell creature  and right off the bat you basically just have to live  survive  reproduce. So here we are  at a very microscopic scale  swimming around. And I actually realize that cells don't have eyes  but it helps to make it cute. The players are going to play through every generation of this species  and as you play the game the creature is actually growing bit by bit. And as we start growing the camera will actually start zooming out  and things that you see in the background there will actually start slowly pulling into the foreground  showing you a little bit of what you'll be interacting with as you grow. So as we eat  the camera starts pulling out  and then we start interacting with kind of larger and larger organisms. Now  we actually play through many generations here  at the cellular scale. I'm going to skip ahead here. At some point we get larger  and we actually get to a macro evolution scale. Now at this point we're leaving the water  and one thing that's kind of important about this game is that  at every level  the player is designing their creature  and that's a fundamental aspect of this. Now  in the evolution game here  the creature scale  basically you have to eat  survive  and then reproduce. You know  very Darwinian. One thing we noticed with  The Sims   which is a game I did earlier  is that players love making stuff. When they were able to make stuff in the game they had a tremendous amount of empathy in connection to it. Even if it wasn't as pretty as what other people would make it    as a professional artist would make for games    it really stuck with them and they really cared about what would happen to it. So at this point  we've left the water  and now with this little creature    we could bring up the volume a little bit    and now we might try to eat. We might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe  and try and eat him. OK  well  we fight. OK  we got him. Now we get a meal. So really  at this part of the game  what we're doing is we're running around and surviving  and also getting to the next generation  because we're going to play through every generation of this creature. We can mate  so I'm going to see if one of these creatures wants to mate with me. Yeah. We didn't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that  because it's almost more interesting to look at alternate possibilities in evolution. Evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through  but really it represents this huge set of possibilities. Now once we mate  we click on the egg. And this is where the game starts getting interesting  because one of the things we really focused on here was giving the players very high leverage tools  so that for a very small amount of effort the player can make something very cool. And it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side. But basically  this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature. So it has a little spine. I can move around here. I can extend. I can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel  so you sculpt it like clay. We have parts here that I can put on or pull off. The idea is that the player can basically design anything they can think of in this editor  and we'll basically bring it to life. So  for instance  I might put some limbs on the character here. I'll inflate them kind of large. And in this case I might decide I'm going to put    I'll put mouths on the limbs. So pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game. Here  I'll give it one eye in the middle  maybe scale it up a bit. Point it down. And I'll also give it a few legs. So in some sense we want this to feel like an amplifier for the player's imagination  so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something that they didn't really think was possible before. You know  this is almost like designing something like Maya that an eight year old can use. But really the goal here was  within about a minute  I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create. OK  now I'll put some hands on it. OK  so here I've basically thrown together a little creature. Let me give it a little weapon on the tail here  so it can fight. OK  so that's the complete model. Now we can actually go to the painting phase. Now  at this phase  the program actually has some understanding of the topology of this creature. It kind of knows where the backbone is  where the spine  the limbs are. It kind of knows how stripes should run  how it should be shaded. And so we're procedurally generating the texture map  and this is something a texture artist would take many  many days to work on. And then we can test it out  once we've done that  and see how it would move around. And so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature. It's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life. And I can see how it might dance. how it might show emotions  how it might fight. So it's acting with its two mouths there. I can even have it pose for a photo. Snap a little photo of it. So at any rate  then I bring this back into the game. It's born  and I play the next generation of my creature through evolution. Now again  the empathy that the players have when they create the content is tremendous. Now  when players create content in this game  it's automatically sent up to a server and then redistributed to all the other players transparently. So in fact  as I'm interacting in this world with other creatures  these creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play. So the process of playing the game is a process of building up this huge database of content. And pretty much everything you're going to see in this game  there's an editor for in the game that the player can create  all the way up through civilization. This is my baby. When I eat  I'll actually start growing. This is the next generation. But I'm going to skip way ahead here. Now  normally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up  eventually become intelligent. I'd start dealing with tribes  cities and civilizations of them over time. I'm going to skip way ahead here to the space phase. Eventually they would go out into space  and start colonizing and exploring the universe. Now really  in some sense  I want the players to be building this world in their imagination  and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain. So that's kind of what these tools are about  are  how do we make the game play the player's imagination amplifier  And how do we make these tools  these editors  something that are just as fun as the game itself  So this is the planet that we've been playing on up to this point in the game. So far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here. Now  at this point we're actually dealing with a very little toy planet. Almost  again  like the Montessori toy idea. You know  what happens if you give somebody a toy planet  and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it  what could they discover  What might they learn on this  This world was actually extracted from the player's imagination. So  this is the planet that the player evolved on. Things like the buildings  and the vehicles  the architecture  civilizations were all designed by the player up to this point. So here's a little city with some of our guys kind of walking around in it. And most games kind of put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker  this protagonist playing through this story. Really  this is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas  you know  I want them  after they've played this game  to have extracted an entire world that they're now interacting with. Now  as we pull down here  we still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet. There are all these different dynamics going on here. In fact  I can look over here  and this is kind of a little simplified food web that's going on with the creatures. I can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface  and get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in. Some of these were created by the player  others by other players and automatically sent over here. But there's a very simple little kind of calculation of what's required  how much plants are required for the herbivores to live  how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat  etc.  that you actually have to balance actively. Now also with this phase  we're getting more and more God like powers for the player  and you can kind of experiment with this planet again as a toy. So I can come in and I can do things  and just treat this planet as a lump of clay. We have very simple little weather systems you see here  very simple geology. For instance  I could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers. So this whole thing is kind of like a big lump of clay  a sculpture. I can also play with the dynamics of this world over time. So one of the things I can do is start pumping more CO  gases into the atmosphere  and so that's what I'm doing here. There's actually a little read out down there of our planetary atmosphere  pressure and temperature. So as I start pumping in more atmosphere  we're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here and if you'll start noticing  we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time. And our cities are going to be at risk too  because a lot of these are coastal cities. You can see the ocean levels are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities  I'll start losing cities here. So basically  I want the players to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space. So there goes one city. Now over time  this is actually going to heat up the planet. So at first what we're going to see is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet  but then over time    I can speed it up just a little bit    we'll actually see the heat impact of that as well. So not only will it get hotter  but at some point it's going to get so hot the oceans will entirely evaporate. So at first they'll go up  and then they'll evaporate  and that'll be my planet. So basically  what we're getting here is the sequel to  An Inconvenient Truth   in about two minutes  and that actually brings up an interesting point about games. Now here  our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface  and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet's going to melt down. Here it goes. So we're not only simulating biological dynamics    food webs and all that    but also geologic  you know  on a very simple core scale. And what's interesting to me about games  in some sense  is that I think we can take a lot of long term dynamics and compress them into very short term kind of experiences. Because it's so hard for people to think    or     years out  but when you can give them a toy  and they can experience these long term dynamics in just a few minutes  I think it's an entirely different kind of point of view  where we're actually mapping  using the game to re map our intuition. It's almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight  I think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time. So here's our little solar system  as we pull away from our melted planet here. We actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system. Let's fly to another one. So in fact  we're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can kind of explore here. Now  as we move into the future  and we start going out in this space and doing stuff  we're drawing a lot from things like science fiction. And all my favorite science fiction movies I want to basically play out here as different dynamics. So this planet actually has some life on it. Here it is  some indigenous life down here. Now one of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO is a monolith that I can drop down. Now as you can see  these guys are actually starting to go up and bow to it  and over time  once they touch it  they will become intelligent. So I can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient. You see  now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics. And now  because I'm actually the one here  I can  if I want to  get out of the UFO and walk up  and they should be worshipping me at this point as a god. At first they're a little freaked out. OK  well maybe they're not worshipping me. I think I'll leave before they get hostile. But we basically want a diversity of activities the players can play through this. Basically  I want to be able to play   The Day the Earth Stood Still          A Space Odyssey    Star Trek    War Of the Worlds.  Now as we pull away from this world    we're going to keep pulling away from the star now. One of the things that always frustrated me a little bit about astronomy when I was a kid is how it was always presented so two dimensionally and so static. As we pull away from the star here  we're actually going now out into interstellar space  and we're getting a sense of the space around our home star. Now what I really wanted to do is to present this  basically as wonderfully  D as it is actually is. And not only that  but also show the dynamics  and a lot of the interesting objects that you might find  maybe like in the Hubble  at pretty much realistic frequencies and scales. So most people have no idea of the difference between like  an emission nebula and a planetary nebula. But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here. So we're flying over here to what looks like a black hole. I want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects that people can kind of interact with and play with  again  as toys. So here's a little black hole that we probably don't want to get too close to. But we also have stars and things as well. If we pull all the way back  we start seeing the entire galaxy here  kind of slowly in motion. And this is another thing where  typically when people present galaxies  it's always been these very beautiful photos  but they're always static. And when you actually bring it forward in time and start animating it  it's actually kind of amazing  what a galaxy would look like  fast forwarded. This would be about one million years a second  because you have about roughly one supernova every century or so. And so you'd have this wonderful sparkling thing  with the disk slowly rotating  and this is roughly what it would look like. And so really  part of this is about bringing the beauty of this  of the natural world  to somebody in a very imaginative way  so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time. Chris was wondering what kind of gods that the players would become. Because if you think about it  you're going to have    year olds     year olds  whatever  flying around this universe. And they might be a nurturing god. They might be boot strapping life on planets  trying to terra form and spread civilization. You might be a vengeful god and going out and conquesting  because you actually can do that  you can go in and attack other intelligent races. You might be a networking god  building alliances  which you can also do in the game  or just curious  going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can. But basically  the reason why I make toys like this is because I think if there's one difference I could possibly make in the world  that I would choose to make  it's that I would like to somehow give people just a little bit better calibration on long term thinking. Because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short term thinking  and the fact that it is so hard for us to think          or       years out. And I think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics  very long term dynamics over the short term  and getting some sense of what we're doing now  what it's going to be like in     years  I think probably is the most effective thing I can be doing to help the world. And so that's why I think  personally  that toys can change the world. Thank you. This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times. The punch line   On the other hand  I don't have to get up at four every single morning to milk my Labrador.  This is a recent cover of New York Magazine. Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment  births  strokes  heart disease  hip replacements    a.m. emergencies. And this is a song medley I put together    Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand  It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour. A time for inconveniences  mishaps  yearnings. A time for plotting to whack the chief of police  like in this classic scene from  The Godfather.  Coppola's script describes these guys as   exhausted in shirt sleeves. It is four in the morning.  A time for even grimmer stuff than that  like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's  The House of the Spirits.  After the breathtaking green haired Rosa is murdered  the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste. They worked until four o'clock in the morning. A time for even grimmer stuff than that  like in last April's New Yorker magazine. This short fiction piece by Martin Amis starts out   On September           he opened his eyes at   a.m. in Portland  Maine  and Mohamed Atta's last day began.  For a time that I find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day  four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press    across a lot of different media from a lot of big names. And it made me suspicious. I figured  surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world  really  aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it  right  Could it be there is something more going on here  Something deliberate  something secret  and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway  I say this guy    Alberto Giacometti  shown here with some of his sculptures on the Swiss     franc note. He did it with this famous piece from the New York Museum of Modern Art. Its title     The Palace at Four in the Morning        . Not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning I can find. I believe that this so called first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it. I call this The Giacometti Code  a TED exclusive. No  feel free to follow along on your Blackberries or your iPhones if you've got them. It works a little something like    this is a recent Google search for four in the morning. Results vary  of course. This is pretty typical. The top    results yield you four hits for Faron Young's song   It's Four in the Morning   three hits for Judi Dench's film   Four in the Morning   one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem   Four in the Morning.  But what  you may ask  do a Polish poet  a British Dame  a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent Google ranking  Well  let's start with Faron Young    who was born incidentally in     . In       he shot himself in the head on December ninth    which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday. But he didn't die on Dench's birthday. He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self inflicted gunshot wound at the age of       which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died. Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this  She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi. On that very day  December          while Mr. Four in the Morning  Faron Young  was giving up the ghost in Nashville  Tennessee  Ms. Four in the Morning    or one of them anyway    Wislawa Szymborska was in Stockholm  Sweden  accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.     years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself. Coincidence  No  it's creepy. Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric. That's like me telling you   Hey  you know the Nobel Prize was established in       which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born   No  not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm  but that does not mean there's not something going on at the highest possible levels. In fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see. Video  Homer Simpson  We have a tennis court  a swimming pool  a screening room    You mean if I want pork chops  even in the middle of the night  your guy will fry them up  Herbert Powell  Sure  that's what he's paid for. Now do you need towels  laundry  maids  HS  Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait    let me see if I got this straight. It is Christmas Day    a.m. There's a rumble in my stomach. Marge Simpson  Homer  please. Rives  Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait. Let me see if I got this straight  Matt. When Homer Simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock  but the whole freaking calendar  he comes up with      on the birthday of the Baby Jesus. And no  I don't know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things  but obviously I know a coded message when I see one. I said  I know a coded message when I see one. And folks  you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's  My Life  from the bookstore here at TED. Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want. Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt. And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket  Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs  This is page     on your paperbacks if you're following along   Though it was getting better  I still wasn't satisfied with the inaugural address. My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day  I was still changing it.  Sure you were  because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you. And then    three paragraphs later we get this little beauty   We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time. It had gotten a lot better since   a.m.  Well  how could it have  By his own writing  this man was either asleep  at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase. What happens to American presidents at      on inauguration day  What happened to William Jefferson Clinton  We might not ever know. And I noticed  he's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions. It could get awkward  right  I mean after all  this whole business happened on his watch. But if he were here    he might remind us  as he does in the wrap up to his fine autobiography  that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey    a journey that saw him go on to become the first Democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades. In generations. The first since this man  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election  way back in a simpler time  way back in         the year Alberto Giacometti made  The Palace at Four in the Morning.  The year  let's remember  that this voice  now departed  first came a cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours. I'm a medical illustrator  and I come from a slightly different point of view. I've been watching  since I grew up  the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences. And while these are both wonderful things in their own right    they both have very wonderful things going for them    truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date. These are expressions of truth as awe full things  by meaning they are things you can worship. They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible. They are unique. They are useful    sometimes  often a long time after the fact. And you can actually roll some of the pictures now  because I don't want to look at me on the screen. Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences. They are things that describe beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed. If you look at the math  E mc squared  if you look at the cosmological constant  where there's an anthropic ideal  where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe    these are things that are really difficult to understand. And what I've tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator    since I was taught animation by my father  who was a sculptor and my visual mentor    I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation  by using pictures  by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth  and can be taught  and can be understood. Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them  but the way they're taught is compartmentalized and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident. It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone. We don't want to do that to our students. So we have an opportunity to really open up education. And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard  in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department  a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard. So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell    that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on. They could have a mental image of the cell as a large  bustling  hugely complicated city that's occupied by micro machines. And these micro machines really are at the heart of life. These micro machines  which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over  are self directed  powerful  precise  accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids. And these micro machines power how a cell moves. They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts. They power our minds. And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard  which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will    in addition to all the textual information  in addition to all the didactic stuff    put everything together visually  so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty  and be able to study with this view in mind  so that their imaginations would be sparked  so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out  really  how life works. So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together. We worked with a theme  which is  you've got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary  and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall  and they're picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall  and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside  where they can't see and sense. But they get the information that causes them to stop  causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape  and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on. So these molecular motors    we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved  and figure out what they did. And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on  but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening. And so what I'm going to show you is a three minute Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced. It's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years. And I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures    these little walking machines  they're called kinesins    that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size. Run the movie  please. But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing  and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other. They pass information to each other. They cause different things to happen inside the cell. And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly  from information that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes. No life  from the smallest life to everybody here  would be possible without these little micro machines. In fact  it would really  in the absence of these machines  have made the attendance here  Chris  really quite sparse. This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell. This little guy is called the kinesin  and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it's needed in the cell    whether it's to a membrane  whether it's to an organelle  whether it's to build something or repair something. And each of us has about         of these things running around  right now  inside each one of your     trillion cells. So no matter how lazy you feel  you're not really intrinsically doing nothing. So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this  and think about how powerful our cells are. And think about some of the things that we're learning about cellular mechanics. Once we figure out all that's going on    and believe me  we know almost a percent of what's going on    once we figure out what's going on  we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health  with what we do with future generations  and how long we're going to live. And hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth  and more beauty. But it's really quite amazing that these cells  these micro machines  are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding. They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do. And their working together helps our bodies    huge entities that they will never see    function properly. Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you. Allison Hunt  My three minutes hasn't started yet  has it  Chris Anderson  No  you can't start the three minutes. Reset the three minutes  that's just not fair. AH  Oh my God  it's harsh up here. I mean I'm nervous enough as it is. But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago. Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery. Do you know that surgery  Electric saw  power drill  totally disgusting unless you're David Bolinsky  in which case it's all truth and beauty. Sure David  if it's not your hip  it's truth and beauty. Anyway  I did have a really big epiphany around the situation  so Chris invited me to tell you about it. But first you need to know two things about me. Just two things. I'm Canadian  and I'm the youngest of seven kids. Now  in Canada  we have that great healthcare system. That means we get our new hips for free. And being the youngest of seven  I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK  So my hip had been hurting me for years. I finally went to the doctor  which was free. And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon  also free. Finally got to see him after    months of waiting    almost a year. That is what free gets you. I met the surgeon  and he took some free X rays  and I got a good look at them. And you know  even I could tell my hip was bad  and I actually work in marketing. So he said   Allison  we've got to get you on the table. I'm going to replace your hip    it's about an    month wait.     more months. I'd already waited    months  and I had to wait    more months. You know  it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs. I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED. I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa. I would not have my new hip for TED    . I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing. So  I left his office and I was walking through the hospital  and that's when I had my epiphany. This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line. Oh yeah. Can I tell you how un Canadian that is  We do not think that way. We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration. In fact  when we're traveling abroad  it's how we identify fellow Canadians.  After you.   Oh  no  no. After you.  Hey  are you from Canada   Oh  me too  Hi    Great  Excellent   So no  suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list. Some    year old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing  or gardening. No  no. Front of the line. So by now I was walking the lobby  and of course  that hurt  because of my hip  and I kind of needed a sign. And I saw a sign. In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said   Volunteers Needed.  Hmm. Well  they signed me up immediately. No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff  no. They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was   . Yeah. They needed some young blood. So  next thing you know  I had my bright blue volunteer vest  I had my photo ID  and I was fully trained by my    year old boss. I worked alone. Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop. While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs  I'd casually ask   What do you do   Then I'd tell them   Well  I'm getting my hip replaced    in    months. It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow   All the staff got to know the plucky  young volunteer. My next surgeon's appointment was  coincidentally  right after a shift at the gift shop. So  naturally  I had my vest and my identification. I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office. And you know  when he walked in  I could just tell that he saw them. Moments later  I had a surgery date just weeks away  and a big fat prescription for Percocet. Now  word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line. And  you know  I'm not even ashamed of that. Two reasons. First of all  I am going to take such good care of this new hip. But also I intend to stick with the volunteering  which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all. Even when a Canadian cheats the system  they do it in a way that benefits society. Well  first of all  let me thank Emeka    as a matter of fact  TED Global    for putting this conference together. This conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the   st century. Think African governments will put together a conference like this  You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this  Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid. I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows June Arunga  James Shikwati  Andrew  and the other TED Fellows. I call them the Cheetah Generation. The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption. They understand what accountability and democracy is. They're not going to wait for government to do things for them. That's the Cheetah Generation  and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs. In contrast  of course  we have the Hippo Generation. The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites. They are stuck in their intellectual patch. Complaining about colonialism and imperialism  they wouldn't move one foot. If you ask them to reform the economies  they're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo. Now  there are a lot of Africans who are very angry  angry at the condition of Africa. Now  we're talking about a continent that is not poor. It is rich in mineral resources  natural mineral resources. But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty. That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry. And in a way  Africa is more than a tragedy  in more ways than one. There's another enduring tragedy  and that tragedy is that there are so many people  so many governments  so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa. They don't understand. Now  we're not saying don't help Africa. Helping Africa is noble. But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd. It's like the blind leading the clueless. There are certain things that we need to recognize. Africa's begging bowl leaks. Did you know that    percent of the wealth created in Africa is not invested here in Africa  It's taken out of Africa. That's what the World Bank says. Look at Africa's begging bowl. It leaks horribly. There are people who think that we should pour more money  more aid into this bowl which leaks. What are the leakages  Corruption alone costs Africa     billion dollars a year. Yes  put that aside. Capital flight out of Africa     billion a year. Put that aside. Let's take food imports. Every year Africa spends    billion dollars to import food. Just add that up  all these leakages. That's far more than the    billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa. Now  back in the     s Africa not only fed itself  it also exported food. Not anymore. We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong. You know it  I know it  but let's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here. Let's move on  and flip over to the next chapter  and that's what this conference is all about    the next chapter. The next chapter begins with first of all  asking ourselves this fundamental question   Whom do we want to help in Africa   There is the people  and then there is the government or leaders. Now  the previous speaker before me  Idris Mohammed  indicated that we've had abysmal leadership in Africa. That characterization  in my view  is even more charitable. I belong to an Internet discussion forum  an African Internet discussion forum  and I asked them  I said   Since       we've had exactly     African heads of state  since     .  And I asked them to name me just    good leaders  just    good leaders    you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself. I asked them to name me just   . Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela  of course. Kwame Nkrumah  Nyerere  Kenyatta    somebody mentioned Idi Amin. I let that pass. My point is  they couldn't go beyond   . Even if they had been able to name me     what does that tell you     out of     means that the vast majority of the African leaders failed their people. And if you look at them  the slate of the post colonial leaders    an assortment of military fufu heads  Swiss bank socialists  crocodile liberators  vampire elites  quack revolutionaries. Now  this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that Africans have known for centuries. The second false premise that we make when we're trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in Africa that cares about its people  serves the interests of the people  and represents the people. There is one particular quote    a Lesotho chief once said that  Here in Lesotho  we've got two problems  rats and the government.  What you and I understand as a government doesn't exist in many African countries. In fact  what we call our governments are vampire states. Vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people. Government is the problem in Africa. A vampire state is the government       which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves  their cronies  and tribesmen and exclude everybody else. The richest people in Africa are heads of state and ministers  and quite often the chief bandit is the head of state himself. Where do they get their money  By creating wealth  No. By raking it off the backs of their suffering people. That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution. The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people  we must know where the African people are. Take any African economy. An African economy can be broken up into three sectors. There is the modern sector  there is the informal sector and the traditional sector. The modern sector is the abode of the elites. It's the seat of government. In many African countries the modern sector is lost. It's dysfunctional. It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems  which the elites themselves don't understand. That is the source of many of Africa's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector  claiming innocent lives. Now the modern sector  of course  is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into. More than    percent of Ivory Coast's development went into the modern sector. The other sectors  the informal and the traditional sectors  are where you find the majority of the African people  the real people in Africa. That's where you find them. Now  obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people  you go where the people are. But that's not what we did. As a matter of fact  we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors. Now  traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture  which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself  and that's why it must import food. All right  you cannot develop Africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors. And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work. These two sectors  let me describe to you  have their own indigenous institutions. First one is the political system. Traditionally  Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny. If you look into their traditional systems  Africans organize their states in two types. The first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous  so they didn't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority. These societies are the Ibo  the Somali  the Kikuyus  for example. They have no chiefs. The other ethnic groups  which did have chiefs  made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power. In Ashanti tradition  for example  the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders. Without the council the chief can't pass any law  and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed. If not  the people will abandon the chief  go somewhere else and set up a new settlement. And even if you look in ancient African empires  they were all organized around one particular principle    the confederacy principle  which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority  decentralization of power. Now  this is what I have described to you. This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage. Now  compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on Africa. It is a total far cry. In the economic system in traditional Africa  the means of production is privately owned. It's owned by extended families. You see  in the West  the basic economic and social unit is the individual. The American will say   I am because I am  and I can damn well do anything I want  anytime.  The accent is on the  I.  In Africa  the Africans say   I am  because we are.  The  we  connotes community    the extended family system. The extended family system pools its resources together. They own farms. They decide what to do  what to produce. They don't take any orders from their chiefs. They decide what to do. And when they produce their crops  they sell the surplus on marketplaces. When they make a profit it is theirs to keep  not for the chief to sequester it from them. So  in a nutshell  what we had in traditional Africa was a free market system. There were markets in Africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent. Timbuktu was one great big market town. Kano  Salaga    they were all there. Even if you go to West Africa  you notice that market activity in West Africa has always been dominated by women. So  it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace. The market is not alien to Africa. What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism  but then after independence  all of a sudden  markets  capitalism became a western institution  and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism. Nonsense. And even then  what kind of socialism did they practice  The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of Swiss bank socialism  which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder Africa's treasuries for deposit in Switzerland. That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries. What do we do now  Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions  and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors  the traditional sectors. That's where you find the African people. And I'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector  about the boat building that I  myself  tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora to invest in. Could you please show that  The men are going fishing in these small boats. Yes  it's an enterprise. This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur  using his own capital. He's getting no assistance from the government  and he's building a second  bigger boat. A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed. It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians. It also means that he will be able to generate wealth. And then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy. All that you need to do  all that the elites need to do  is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient. Now  it is not just this informal sector. There is also traditional medicine.    percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine. The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed. Now  this is an area    I mean  there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area. This is where we need to mobilize Africans  in the Diaspora especially  to invest in this. We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora  not only to go into the traditional sectors  but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within. We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana. And I know that with the Cheetahs  we can take Africa back one village at a time. Thank you very much. It's very  very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this  because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said. So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here  and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away  and take forward and work on. That's what I'd like to try and do. We came here saying we want to talk about  Africa  the Next Chapter.  But we are talking about  Africa  the Next Chapter  because we are looking at the old and the present chapter    that we're looking at  and saying it's not such a good thing. The picture I showed you before  and this picture  of drought  death and disease is what we usually see. What we want to look at is  Africa  the Next Chapter   and that's this  a healthy  smiling  beautiful African. And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard through the conference right from the first day  where I heard that all the important statistics have been given    about where we are now  about how the continent is doing much better. And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on. So I'm not going to spend too much time    just to show you  refresh your memories that we are here for  Africa  the Next Chapter  because for the first time there really is a platform to build on. We really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen. After decades of   percent  we are now at   percent  and it's going to    projected      and   percent even. And inflation has come down. External debt    something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent    has come down dramatically. You know  as you can see  from almost    billion down to about    or    billion. Now this is a huge achievement. You know  we've built up reserves. Why is that important  It's because it shows off our economies  shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build  including businesses. We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased. I want to remind you again    I know you saw these statistics before    from almost   billion we are now at about    billion. In       remittances    I just took one country  Nigeria skyrocketing    skyrocketing is too dramatic  but increasing dramatically. And in many other countries this is happening. Why is this important  Because it shows confidence. People are now confident to bring    if your people in the diaspora bring their money back  it shows other people that  look  there is emerging confidence in your country. And instead of an outflow  you are now getting a net inflow. Now  why is all this important  to have to go really fast  It's important that we build this platform  that we have the president  Kikwete  and others of our leaders who are saying   Look  we must do something different.  Because we are confronted with a challenge.    percent of our population is below the age of   . What does this mean  This means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives. You have to focus on how to create jobs  make sure they don't fall into disease  and that they get an education. But most of all that they are productively engaged in life  and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen. And to support this  I just recently    one of the things I've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria. Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research. People don't have voice. There is no way you can know what people want. One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue. Like in every other country where this has been done  jobs is the top issue. I want to leave this up here and come back to it. But before I get to this slide  I just wanted to run you through this. And to say that for me  the next stage of building this platform that now enables us to move forward    and we mustn't make light of it. It was only         years ago we couldn't even talk about the next chapter  because we were in the old chapter. We were going nowhere. The economies were not growing. We were having negative per capita growth. The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there. So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this  including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to. Creating our own program to solve problems  like fighting corruption  building institutions  stabilizing the micro economy. So now we have this platform we can build on. And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here  aid versus private sector  aid versus trade  etc. And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate. And that's not what the debate should be about. That's engaging in the wrong debate. The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors  the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives  How do we combine all this  To move our continent forward  to do the things that need doing that I talked about    getting young people employed. Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent  much of what you have seen here. So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate. We need to bring it back to say  what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want   Applause  And I want to tell you something. For me  the issue about aid    I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid. Africa has been giving the other countries aid. Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid. And I said   Mo  you're right. We have    no  but we've already been doing it  The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid.  It is all the resources that were taken from Africa  including human  that built these countries today  So when they try to give back  we shouldn't be on the defensive. The issue is not that. The issue is how are we using what has been given back. How are we using it  Is it being directed effectively  I want to tell you a little story. Why I don't mind if we get aid  but we use it well. From      to '    Nigeria fought a war    the Nigeria Biafra war. And in the middle of that war  I was    years old. We spent much of our time with my mother cooking. For the army    my father joined the army as a brigadier    the Biafran army. We were on the Biafran side. And we were down to eating one meal a day  running from place to place  but wherever we could help we did. At a certain point in time  in       things were really bad. We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day. People  children were dying of kwashiorkor. I'm sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures. Well  I was in the middle of it. In the midst of all this  my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days. We thought she was going to die. My father was not there. He was in the army. So I was the oldest person in the house. My sister fell very ill with malaria. She was three years old and I was   . And she had such a high fever. We tried everything. It didn't look like it was going to work. Until we heard that    kilometers away there was a doctor  who was looking at people and giving them meds. Now I put my sister on my back    burning    and I walked    kilometers with her strapped on my back. It was really hot. I was very hungry. I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman. We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people. I walked    kilometers  putting one foot in front of the other. I got there and I saw huge crowds. Almost a thousand people were there  trying to break down the door. She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in  I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back  find a way to a window. And while they were trying to break down the door  I climbed in through the window  and jumped in. This woman told me it was in the nick of time. By the time we jumped into that hall  she was barely moving. She gave a shot of her chloroquine    what I learned was the chloroquine then    gave her some    it must have been a re hydration    and some other therapies  and put us in a corner. In about two to three hours  she started to move. And then they toweled her down because she started sweating  which was a good sign. And then my sister woke up. And about five or six hours later  she said we could go home. I strapped her on my back. I walked the    kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had. I was so happy     Applause     that my sister was alive  Today she's    years old  a mother of three  and she's a physician saving other lives. Why am I telling that  I'm telling you that because    when it is you or your person involved    you don't care where    whether it's aid. You don't care what it is   Applause  You just want the person to be alive  And now let me become less sentimental  and say that saving lives    which some of the aid we get does on this continent    when you save the life of anyone  a farmer  a teacher  a mother  they are contributing productively into the economy. And as an economist  we can also look at that side of the story. These are people who are productive agents in the economy. So if we save people from HIV AIDS  if we save them from malaria  it means they can form the base of production for our economy. And by the same token    as someone said yesterday    if we don't and they die  their children will become a burden on the economy. So even from an economic standpoint  if we leave the social and the humanitarian  we need to save lives now. So that's one of the reasons  from a personal experience  that I say let's channel these resources we get into something productive. However  I will also tell you that I'm one of those who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer. That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated. You know  we have to use it well. What has happened in Europe  Do you all know that Spain    part of the EU    got    billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU  Resources that were transferred to them    and were the Spanish ashamed of this  No  The EU transferred    billion. Where did they use it  Have you been to southern Spain lately  There are roads everywhere. Infrastructure everywhere. It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy. Did you know that Ireland got   billion dollars in aid  Ireland is one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union today. For which many people  even from other parts of the world  are going there to find jobs. What did they do with the   billion dollars in aid  They used it to build an information superhighway  gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution  and to create jobs in their economy. They didn't say   No  you know  we're not going to take this.  Today  the European Union is busy transferring aid. My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain    which is roads  highways  other things that they can build    I say then  why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries   Applause  When we ask them and tell them what we need  one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now. Now we talk about the World Bank  IMF  and accountability  all that and the EU. We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money    some of them in this audience  with private foundations. And one day  these foundations have so much money  they will overtake the official aid that is being given. But I fear    and I'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent    but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent. And they're also going from country to country  and many times trying to find what to do. But I'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way. And many of them are not really familiar with the continent. They are just discovering. And many times I don't see Africans working with them. They are just going alone   Applause  And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know. They want to visit us  see what's happening on the ground and make a decision. And now I'm maybe being harsh. But I worry because this money is so important. Now  who are they accountable to  Are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money  Are we there  Will we make the same mistake that we made before  Have our presidents and our leaders    everyone is talking about    have they ever called these people together and said   Look  your foundation and your foundation    you have so much money  we are grateful. Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go.  Have we done that  The answer is no. And each one is making their own individual effort. And then    years from now  billions will again have gone into Africa  and we would still have the same problems. This is what gives us the hopeless image. Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money   Sit down.  And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate. We've not called the Bill Gates  and the Soros  and everybody else who is helping and say   Sit down. Let's have a conference with you. As a continent  here are our priorities. Here is where we want you to channel this money.  Each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best. We're not trying to stop them at all  But to help them help us better. And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this. Ten years from now we will have the same story  and we will be repeating the same things. So our problem right now is  how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way  How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations  with the international organizations  and with our private sector. I firmly believe in that private sector thing too. But it cannot do it alone. So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work. They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas. So why don't we think of using some of this aid  Well  why don't we first say to those helping us out   Don't be shy about infrastructure. That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure. That education will work better if we've got electricity and railroads  and so on. That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market. Don't be shy of it. Invest some of your resources in that  too.  And then we can see that this is one combination of private  international  multilateral money  private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership  so that aid can be a facilitator. That is all aid can be. Aid cannot solve our problems  I'm firmly convinced about that. But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic  we would have failed. One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now    one of the reasons is not only just that  you know  these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources. It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese. If you tell them   We need a road here   they will help you build it. They don't shy away from infrastructure. In fact  the Chinese minister of finance said to me  when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria. He said   There are two things you need only. Infrastructure  infrastructure  infrastructure and discipline. You are undisciplined.   Applause  And I repeat it for the continent. It's the same. We need infrastructure  infrastructure and discipline. So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that. Now I realize    I'm not saying    health and education    no  you can also provide that as well. But I'm saying it's not either or. Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership. One idea. Second thing  for the private sector  people are afraid to take risks on the continent. Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms  to enable people to take risk  And finally  because they are both standing at my    I'm out of time. Am I out of time  OK  so let me not forget my punchline. One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women  to create jobs.  Applause  A lot has been said here about women  I don't need to repeat it. But there are people    women    creating jobs. And we know  studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman    in fact  there's an econometric study  the World Bank Review  done in       showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children  more for the household  more for the economy and all that. So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here    I'm not saying the men are not important    obviously  if you leave the husbands out  what will they do  They'll come back home and get disgruntled  and it will result in difficulties we don't want. We don't want men beating their wives because they don't have a job  and so on. But at the margin  we also    I want to push this  because the reason is the men automatically    they get    not automatically  but they tend to get more support. But I want you to realize that resources in the hands of African women is a powerful tool. There are people creating jobs. Beatrice Gakuba has created     jobs from her flower business in Rwanda. We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria  with the chair company. She wants to expand. She needs another    million. She will create another          more jobs. So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready    business people who want to expand and create more jobs. And lastly  what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid  government  private sector and the African as an individual  Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  William  hi. Good to see you. William Kamkwamba  Thanks. CA  So  we've got a picture  I think  Where is this  WK  This is my home. This is where I live. CA  Where  What country  WK  In Malawi  Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah  Mala. CA  OK. Now  you're    now  WK  Yeah. I'm    years now. CA  Five years ago you had an idea. What was that  WK  I wanted to make a windmill. CA  A windmill  WK  Yeah. CA  What  to power    for lighting and stuff  WK  Yeah. CA  So what did you do  How did you realize that  WK  After I dropped out of school  I went to library  and I read a book that would     Using Energy   and I get information about doing the mill. And I tried  and I made it. CA  So you copied    you exactly copied the design in the book. WK  Ah  no. I just    CA  What happened  WK  In fact  a design of the windmill that was in the book  it has got four    ah    three blades  and mine has got four blades. CA  The book had three  yours had four. WK  Yeah. CA  And you made it out of what  WK  I made four blades  just because I want to increase power. CA  OK. WK  Yeah. CA  You tested three  and found that four worked better  WK  Yeah. I test. CA  And what did you make the windmill out of  What materials did you use  WK  I use a bicycle frame  and a pulley  and plastic pipe  what then pulls    CA  Do we have a picture of that  Can we have the next slide  WK  Yeah. The windmill. CA  And so  and that windmill  what    it worked  WK  When the wind blows  it rotates and generates. CA  How much electricity  WK     watts. CA  And so  that lit a light for the house  How many lights  WK  Four bulbs and two radios. CA  Wow. WK  Yeah. so who's that  WK  This is my parents  holding the radio. CA  So what did they make of    that you were        at the time    what did they make of this  They were impressed  WK  Yeah. CA  And so what's your    what are you going to do with this  WK  Um    CA  What do you    I mean    do you want to build another one  WK  Yeah  I want to build another one    to pump water and irrigation for crops. CA  So this one would have to be bigger  WK  Yeah. CA  How big  WK  I think it will produce more than    the watts. CA  So that would produce irrigation for the entire village  WK  Yeah. CA  Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream  WK  Yeah  if they can help me with materials  yeah. CA  And as you think of your life going forward  you're    now  do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy  WK  Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy. CA  Wow. William  it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference. Thank you so much for coming. WK  Thank you. Welcome to Africa  Or rather  I should say  welcome home. Because this is where it all really began  isn't it  Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years    it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here. We are on an amazing journey the next four days. You're going to hear stories of  Africa  The Next Chapter.  Fantastic tales  anecdotes from speakers. But I want to turn that upside down for a moment  and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say. What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa  And this is not a rhetorical question. I actually want answers from you. Go for it  The worst. Famine. Corruption. More. Genocide. AIDS. Slavery. That's enough. We've all heard these things. But this is about Africa  the story we have not heard. The stories that we want to know  and the stories that do exist about positive tales. A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent  to separate the rhetoric from the reality  the fact from the fiction. To go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you. So let's get going because Africa  to some degree  is on a turnaround. A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image  and how it takes control of its own destiny. And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career. And it all started almost a decade ago  as a young consultant at McKinsey   Company at their first African office in Johannesburg. And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues  and African companies on turnarounds  making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally. But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds when I was completing my MBA in the United States. It all began with a fantastic phone call. It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter  Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine. And she said   I want to write a case  Euvin    a case on a public sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world.  And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela. Because Nelson Mandela  as he took over power as the first democratically elected president of South Africa  faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos. But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle. Now the case   Nelson Mandela  Change Leader   became part of the research base for a chapter in Rosabeth's new book called  Confidence.  And  Confidence  became a New York Times bestseller and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list. And why I tell you this story is because later  when I was interviewed on SABC Africa  on a pan African broadcast  they asked   What is your key lesson  or the key thing you enjoy the most      because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project. The lesson from that was that it was Africa    an African story    that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds. Africa was being used as a success story  So I want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation. And that has to do with me because in       I packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career. You should have seen my parents' reaction  But very soon  I found myself from the southern part of Africa  in South Africa    at the very north  in Egypt. And I sought out the most remote places. I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops. And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things  but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him. And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert. Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm. And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle  and it foretold his destiny of greatness. This was     BC. So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers. Now  the thing I remember about Siwa was the magical view of the sky at night. With no natural light source  Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry. Fast forward to     . I'm sitting in Cambridge  Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference. And I see the same picture  but from the opposite side. A satellite picture looking down at the earth. And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment. And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point. The first thing that I saw was North America at night    glowing  in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light. And then I saw it    Africa. Quite literally the  Dark Continent.  And while Africa may be dark  the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing  but it's also the opportunity. Because whilst Africa may be dark    other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas    it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there. Entrepreneurs  dynamic people  people with hope. It was George Kimble  the geographer  who said that   The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it.  So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer. Let's start unpacking it. Africa is the second largest continent  a landmass second from Asia. It also is the second most populated continent  with     million people. In fact    coming back to the land mass    Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States  China  and the entire Europe into Africa  and still have space. Africa is home to over       languages          is another estimate that's out there    with over       languages and dialects. But you could say   Invest in Africa in over       languages  and it wouldn't make a difference.  What does the data say  As an investment banker  I'm in the cross flow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets. So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals  or signs  and winds of change that are sweeping this continent. So let's start on that. And let's start at the high level  on the macro factors. Inflation  in general  is coming down across Africa    that's the first sign    in many countries reaching double digit figures. So let's start looking at some of those. I call it my Z.E.N. cluster. Zambia  from      to       moves from the    percent in inflation to the nine percent. Egypt  from the    percent to about  .  percent. Nigeria  a similar situation  from the    percent to the eight percent. Single digits. More fascinating  you have other countries    South Africa  Mauritius  Namibia    all in single digits. But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies    currencies going through an extreme time of stability. But that's looking at the big picture. And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country. It's made up    It's made up of    different countries. So the very definition    to say  invest in Africa  is a no go. It's meaningless. Each country has a unique value proposition. You can make money  you can lose money in Africa. But opportunities  boy oh boy  they exist. And this is what today is about    it's about discussing those very opportunities. So let's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data. I was recently elected  as Emeka mentioned  as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America. And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in. To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity  of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come. So the first port of call  let's talk a little bit about South Africa. But not the South Africa we always talk about    the gold  the minerals  the First World infrastructure    a bit about the other side of it. For example  South Africa was recently voted as the top destination for the top       UK companies for offshore call centers. Same language  timeline  et cetera. Makes sense. Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR  the big boys of private equity. Headline in South Africa   They have landed.  Quite ominous. But what were they there for  To acquire assets. Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon  a large retailer  is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy. Because it is actually a long term play. Being a retailer  it is a play on the belief that this middle class that's growing will continue to grow  that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue. But the story of Africa  and my focus  is beyond South Africa because there's so much happening. Undoubtedly  Nigeria is clearly a hot spot. Challenges    and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days. But looking at Goldman Sachs' work    we had the famous BRIC Report. The new report   The Next Eleven   highlights that by      Nigeria is going to be amongst the top    economies in the world. It's an investment opportunity. Think about that. Is anyone    our banks  our investors    seriously thinking about going to Nigeria  If you haven't  why not  What's going on in Nigeria  A couple of things. I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets. Bellwether signs again. Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond out of Africa  and this excludes South Africa. But the first Eurobond  the raising of international capital offshore  off its own balance sheet  without any sovereign backing    that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy. Without any sovereign backing  a Nigerian company raising capital offshore. It's just a sign of things to come. Looking at the oil industry  Africa provides    percent of the U.S.'s oil supply  with the Middle East just    percent. It's an important strategic partner. Let's put Nigeria in perspective.  .  to  .  million barrels of oil a day    the same league as Kuwait  the same league as Venezuela. But with Africa  let's start being careful about this. And Emeka and I have had these discussions. We have to move away from what's called  the curse of the commodities.  Because it's not about oil  it's not about commodities. For Africa to truly be sustainable  we have to move beyond to other industries. So let's unpack those very quickly  and I'm going to move through these very  very  very fast because I can see that clock counting down. What else is going on there  Egypt. Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone     .  billion investment. The announcement just came out the last few weeks. Close to the Mediterranean  near Alexandria    textiles  petrochemicals. It's being managed by a Singaporean based management company. So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries    away from oil. Let's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry. What's going on there  In Tanzania last week  we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard. Again  gathering together farmers  gathering together stakeholders in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices. It ties in with small scale farmers in terms of no pesticides  no fertilizers. Again  opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price. Uganda  the New Forest Company  replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important  As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed  we will need  poles for rolling out electricity. But here is the sweetener in the deal. They're going to be tapping into carbon credits. Let's go back to Nigeria. The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation  from over    banks to    banks. Strengthening of the system. But what's going on there  Only    percent of the country is banked. The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.     million plus people. Think about that. There are only     ATMs in the country. Opportunity. The same for telecoms across the country. Now let's look at the continent as a whole. People look at the roads  for example  and they'd say   Angola     percent of roads are untarred. Ah  problem   It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up  inflation is affected. Nigeria     percent of roads are untarred. Zambia     percent. In general  more than    percent of roads are untarred. This is an opportunity  Energy needs    it's an opportunity. So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing  Let's look at the stock markets in Africa. If I had to ask you   In      what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world   Would Egypt come to mind  In       the Egyptian stock exchange returned over     percent. What's going on in some of the other countries  Let's look at some      numbers. Kenya  over    percent. Nigeria  over    percent. South Africa  in the    percents. High ones. These are the trends that are taking place. But in any investment decision  the key question is   What is my alternative investment   Because in Africa today  we are competing globally for capital. And global capital is agnostic    it has no loyalties. There's an overhang of capital in the U.S.  and the key is yield pickup. What Africa is providing is a diversification play  and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that's aware of what he or she is doing. Now  when looking at Africa vis a vis other things  and countries in Africa vis a vis other things  comparisons become important.    years ago there  were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard   Poors  Moody's and Fitch's. Today     African countries and growing have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean  Take Nigeria again  double B minus    in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison. The backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital. Some other figures. South Africa  triple B plus. Botswana  A plus. Bakino Faso  B minus. And so on. In fact  one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa. Why are they doing that  Because they expect investment to follow. So one of the big bellwethers  and one of my final points I want to mention  is the interesting thing I read is that CNBC has launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this  It's the    hour rolling African news channel. They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen. Me and you  the investments we are going to be making  the investments the world is going to be making    that's the    hour news channel dedicated to Africa. So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline. So in conclusion  I want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago. This time  I'll  give you the entire picture that I saw in       and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa  think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent. Because there are amazing opportunities available. And think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly. In       Joseph Conrad released  The Heart of Darkness   a tale of grim horror along the Congo River. If one looks carefully  on the Congo River is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river generating light    the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro electric power. That is a transformation in power of ideas. So the next step  over the next four days  is us exploring more of these ideas. And perchance  if you can always keep this picture in your mind  that when we convene maybe in the distant future  in       that picture will look very different. Thank you.
