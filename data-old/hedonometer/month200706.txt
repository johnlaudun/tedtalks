So  I kind of believe that we're in like the  cave painting  era of computer interfaces. Like  they're very kind of    they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. Hit me. OK. So I mean  this is the kind of status quo interface  right  It's very flat  kind of rigid. And OK  so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac  you know  but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last  you know     years. Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers. I mean it's point and click  it's like the menus  icons  it's all the kind of same thing. And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk. It's so much more subtle  so much more visceral    you know  what's visible  what's not. And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop. So I kind of have a    this is BumpTop. It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. So you can bump things    they're all physically  you know  manipulable and stuff. And instead of that point and click  it's like a push and pull  things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk  I can    let me just grab these guys    I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid  or you know  flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. When they're laid out  I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile  you know  just immediately  right  And then  it's all smoothly animated  instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces. Also  if I want to add something to a pile  well  how do I do that  I just toss it to the pile  and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. Also some of the stuff we can do is  for these individual icons we thought    I mean  how can we play with the idea of an icon  and push that further  And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important. But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this  it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys  right  So it's cute  but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information  right  This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool. Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared  because it has a lot of  I think  valuable properties. And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. So one of the things you can do to our icons  just like paper  is crease them and fold them  just like paper. Remember  you know  something for later. Or if you want to be destructive  you can just crumple it up and  you know  toss it to the corner. Also just like paper  around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later  and I can do the same thing here  and you know  you'll see post it notes and things like that around people's offices. And I can pull them off when I want to work with them. So  one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that  you know   Okay  well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer.  So one thing we have for that is like a grid align  kind of    so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. More boring  but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping. And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. Let's just break this shelf. Okay  that shelf broke. I think beyond the icons  I think another really cool domain for this software    I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop    but browsing photographs. I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of  you know  photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable    and you know I can double click on something to take a look at it. And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before. So I can pile things up  I can flip through it  I can  you know    okay  let's move this photo to the back  let's delete this guy here  and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information. And that's BumpTop. Thanks  Thank you. And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me. I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra  an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area  Vaishali  and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him. All the young people  actually  from the city. The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha  because when he came to their city he accepted    he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him  from whoever it is  and the local geisha  a movie star sort of person  raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first. So he was hanging out with the movie star  and of course they were grumbling   He's supposed to be religious and all this. What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his     monks   and so on. They were all grumbling  and so they boycotted him. They wouldn't go listen to him. But the young people all came. And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol  and they put it on the ground. And as soon as they had laid all these  all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India  he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium  the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that  and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes. And of course  in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it  and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets. So they don't    when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky    they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding. They actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that. He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected. And then Leilei    I know his other name    told us about interconnection  and how we're all totally interconnected here  and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe  we've already done this already billions of times in many  many lifetimes in the past. And I didn't give the talk always. You did  and we had to watch you  and so forth. And we're all still trying to  I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters  if that's a modern form of enlightenment. I guess so. Because in a way  if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything  it's the forging of a mass awareness  of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet. And therefore it will become intolerable    what compassion is  is where it will become intolerable for us  totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is  and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place  or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth. It just becomes intolerable. With all of us knowing everything  we're kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something  to become enlightened. And of course  we all will be deeply disappointed when we do. Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do  a little bit tired  we do suffer. We do enjoy our misery in a certain way. We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere  but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other  and each one tries to get out of their own  and ultimately it fails of course  and then we're back into this thing. Because our egocentric perception    from the Buddha's point of view  misperception    is that all we are is what is inside our skin. And it's inside and outside  self and other  and other is all very different. And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception  a little bit  right  You know  someone sitting next to you in a seat    that's OK because you're in a theater  but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you  you'd freak out. What do they want from me  Like  who's that  And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe    that's all Buddha discovered. Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone  each of us  and everyone else is different  then that puts us in an impossible situation  doesn't it  Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world  Who's going to get enough out of the world  Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings    if you're different from all the other beings  So where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way  through art  through meditation  through understanding  through knowledge actually  knowing that you have no such boundary  knowing your interconnectedness with other beings. You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them. When you do that  you're forced to feel what they feel. Luckily  they say    I still am not sure    but luckily  they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature  they say   Oh who would really want to be compassionate  How awful  I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching. My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied. I never have enough  even if I'm a billionaire  I don't have enough. I need a hundred billion.  So I'm like that. Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering. It would be terrible. But apparently  this is a strange paradox of life. When you're no longer locked in yourself  and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world  that enables you to let your mind spread out  and empathize  and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing  and realizing that you are the other being  somehow by that opening  you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can  you get away from this terrible iron circle of I  me  me  mine  like the Beatles used to sing. You know  we really learned everything in the '  s. Too bad nobody ever woke up to it  and they've been trying to suppress it since then. I  me  me  mine. It's like a perfect song  that song. A perfect teaching. But when we're relieved from that  we somehow then become interested in all the other beings. And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange. It's totally strange. The Dalai Lama always likes to say    he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion  it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence. It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that  or what  you know    and the more you focus on how you feel  by the way  the worse it gets. Like  even when you're having a good time  when is the good time over  The good time is over when you think  how good is it  And then it's never good enough. I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time  doing it by having a good time. I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that. He once told me    he looked kind of sad  he worries very much about the haves and have nots. He looked a little sad  because he said  well  a hundred years ago  they went and took everything away from the haves. You know  the big communist revolutions  Russia and China and so forth. They took it all away by violence  saying they were going to give it to everyone  and then they were even worse. They didn't help at all. So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today  And so then he looks at me. So I said   Well  you know  you're all in this yourself. You teach  it's generosity   was all I could think of. What is virtue  But of course  what you said  I think the key to saving the world  the key to compassion is that it is more fun. It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key. Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring  and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly. Even though his people are being genocided    and believe me  he feels every blow on every old nun's head  in every Chinese prison. He feels it. He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays. I won't even say what they do. But he feels it. And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly. Because when you open up like that  then you can't just    what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery  You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is  how it can be changed. Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man. She scared us with the lava man is coming  then the tsunami is coming  but then finally there were flowers and trees  and it was very beautiful. It's really lovely. So  compassion means to feel the feelings of others  and the human being actually is compassion. The human being is almost out of time. The human being is compassion because what is our brain for  Now  Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac. But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is  he will  he did. He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings. And he would have tremendous fun doing that. So the first person who gets happy  when you stop focusing on the self centered situation of  how happy am I  where you're always dissatisfied    as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way. So then you decide   Well  I'm sick of myself. I'm going to think of how other people can be happy. I'm going to get up in the morning and think  what can I do for even one other person  even a dog  my dog  my cat  my pet  my butterfly   And the first person who gets happy when you do that  you don't do anything for anybody else  but you get happier  you yourself  because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it. And you realize that this    being with these people    is the flower garden that Chiho showed us. It is Nirvana. And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments. Thank you. Kurt Andersen  Like many architects  David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent    or at least pretends to be    that he asked me to question him rather than speaking. In fact what we're going to talk about  I think  is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address. And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede. Dan Rather  Since the September   th attack on the World Trade Center  many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the    acre burial ground. Now  as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports  they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene. Jim Axelrod  Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest    Ground Zero. Tourist  I've taken my step daughter here from Indianapolis. This was    out of all the tourist sites in New York City    this was her number one pick. JA  Thousands now line up on lower Broadway. Tourist  I've been wanting to come down here since this happened. JA  Even on the coldest winter days. To honor and remember. Tourist  It's reality  it's us. It happened here. This is ours. JA  So many  in fact  that seeing has become a bit of a problem. Tourist  I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on. JA  But that is about to change. In record time  a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer. Man  They'll get an incredible panorama and understand  I think more completely  the sheer totality of the destruction of the place. JA  If you think about it  Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument  people come here to see what's no longer there. David Rockwell  The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground. JA  The walls are bare by design  so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter. Tourist  From our hearts  it affected us just as much. JA  The ramps are made of simple material    the kind of plywood you see at construction sites    which is really the whole point. In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again. Jim Axelrod  CBS News  New York. KA  This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment  but certainly David you are known as    I know  a phrase you hate    an entertainment architect. Your work is highly sensual  even hedonistic. DR  I like that word. KA  It's about pleasure    casinos and hotels and restaurants. How did the shock that all of us    and especially all of us in New York    felt on the   th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing  DR  Well the truth of the matter is  post September   th  I felt myself in the role originally    first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated  and as someone who works less than a mile from there    that I was in the role of forcing     people who work with me in my firm  to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. In fact we're finishing a book which is called  Pleasure   which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. But I've got to tell you    it became impossible to do that. We were really paralyzed. And I found myself the Friday after September   th    two days afterwards    literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything. We gave the office a few days off. And in discussing this with other architects  we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were    they should rebuild them    stories taller. And I thought it was astonishing to speculate  as if this were a competition  on something that was such a fresh wound. And I had a series of discussions    first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller  who collaborated with us on this  and several other people    and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. And that as people who create places  the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios  but to help right now. So we tried to come up with a way  as a group  to have a kind of design SWAT team. And that was the mission that we came up with. KA  Were you conscious of suddenly    as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants    suddenly fulfilling needs  DR  Well what I was aware of was  there was this overwhelming need to act now. And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this. There was a school  PS      that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. They moved to an abandoned school. We took about    or    architects and designers and artists  and over four days    it was like this urban barn raising    to renovate it  and everyone wanted to help. It was just extraordinary. Tom Otterness contributed  Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us. KA  And that was done  effectively  by October   or something  DR  Yeah. KA  Obviously  what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project    and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site    you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine  entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics. DR  Well  it's a funny thing. We finished PS      and had dinner with a small group. I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild. And I sat in on several meetings. And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled  and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process. And it wasn't an inclusive group. So we said  what is    KA  It was not an inclusive group  DR  It was not an inclusive group. It was predominantly a white  rich  corporate group that was not representative of the city. KA  Shocking. DR  Yeah  surprising. So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. The city actually approached us. We first approached the city about Pier   . We saw how PS     worked. The families    the victims of the families    were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing. KA  On the Hudson River  DR  Yeah. And the city actually    through Tim Zagat initially  and then through Christyne Nicholas  then we got to Giuliani    said   You know we don't want to do anything with Pier    right now  but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families  and a way to protect it from the weather.  So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin  and I've got to say  it was the most moving experience of my life. It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it  where the families of the victims had left notes to them. And there was no mediation between us and the experience. There was no filter. And I remembered on September   th  on   th Street  the roof of our building    we can see the World Trade Towers prominently    and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. And then everyone was up on the roof  so I ran up there. And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience. So seeing this in a very simple  dignified way was a very powerful experience. So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform  but we've spent some time down there. At the same time the city had this need. They were looking for a solution to deal with    or    thousand people a day who were going down there  that had nowhere to go. And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. There was a way    there had to be a way    to get people to move around the site. KA  But then you've got to figure out a way    we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board    but simply funding this thing. It looks like a fairly simple thing  but this was a half a million dollar project  DR  Well  we knew that if it wasn't privately funded  it wasn't going to happen. And we also  frankly  knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration  then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the    we were meeting with    or    people with the city at a time  and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. This incredible act on their part  because they really wanted this  and they sensed that this needed to happen. KA  And there was therefore this ticking clock  because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that. DR  Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this    we had to work with the families of the victims  through the city  to make sure that they knew this was happening. Because this didn't want to be a surprise. And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York  because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible. We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation  mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this  he would not agree to do this  even if we would pay him the money. There needed to be a foundation in place. So we came up with a foundation  and actually what happened was one major developer in New York    KA  Who shall remain nameless  I guess  DR  Yeah. His initials are JS  and he owns Rockefeller Center  if that helps anyone    volunteered to help. And we met with him. The prices from the contractors were between five to         dollars. And Atlantic Heydt  who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country  volunteered to do it at cost. So this developer said   You know what  we'll underwrite the entire expense.  And we said   That's incredible   And I think this was the   st  and we knew this had to be built and up by the   th. And we had to start construction the next day. We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice  and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it. KA  Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge  I guess  DR  In fact  it was as if this was going to be window washing scaffolding. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul    that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified  and a place to reflect and remember. And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together  watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul    which is just to the right    and moving around the site. And I live down there  so we spent a lot of time looking at the need. And I think people were amazed at two things    I think they were amazed at the destruction  but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said   I'm going to lock the door  because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.  And we said   Well  this is half the size  it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone    everyone in the city. We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.  And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed. The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. So we didn't know what to do  but we decided to cast a very wide net. We emailed out letters to as many people as we could    several people in the audience here    who were very helpful. KA  There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point  DR  No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. He had already ordered materials based on my go ahead. We knew that one way or another this was going to happen. And we just felt it had to happen. KA  You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation. Richard  I think very correctly  made the point at the beginning    before all the chair designers came out    about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal  banal  common problem of sitting. It seems to me with this  that it was the opposite of that. This was an unprecedented  singular design problem. DR  Well here's the issue  we knew that this was not in the sense of    we think about the site  and think about the need for a memorial. It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. That this was a place for people to reflect  to remember    a kind of quiet place. So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer    as we said about the families' platform    and the experience as possible. It's all incredibly humble material. It's scaffolding and plywood. And it allows    by sort of the procession of the movement  up by Saint Paul's and down the other side    it gives you about     feet to go up    feet from the ground to where you get the     degree view. But the design was driven by a need to be quick  cheap  safe  respectful  flexible. One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site  one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform  we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions  and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is. KA  Your work    I mean  we've talked about this before    a lot of your work  I think  is informed by your belief in  or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things  and a kind of  Eat  drink  and be merry  for tomorrow we die   sort of sense of existence. This is clearly not a work for the ages. You know  a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. Did that require  as an architect  a new way of thinking about what you were doing  To think of it as this purely temporary installation  DR  No  I don't think so. I think this is  obviously  substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before  just by the nature of it. Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is  number one    the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. And Kevin Kennon  Rick Scofidio  Liz Diller and all the people within the city    Norman Lear  who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding  offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it. So the notion of collaboration    I think this reinforces how important that is. And in terms of the temporary nature of it  our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be. I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city  about what's really happening there. And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address  where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. Which was very controversial  but it resonated with a lot of people. And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used  having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter  I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. And that's what we were interested in. So that  very much  is in the realm of things I've been interested in before. KA  It seems to me  among other things  a lovely piece of civic infrastructure. It enables that conversation to get serious. And six months after the fact    and only a few months away from the site being cleaned    we are very quickly  now  getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. Do you have    having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project    have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done  DR  Well  I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate    I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan. The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings  which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings. KA  But it had some really terrible ideas. DR  And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas  where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses. And I think there should be a broader    which there's starting to be    the dialogue is really opening up to  what does this site really want to be  And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out  that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive  about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over  so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land. KA  Well  I think that's interesting. And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago  but perhaps isn't now  which is  not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture  as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza. Is this an opportunity  is the silver lining    a silver lining  here    to rebuild some more traditional city grid  or not  DR  I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day  I don't think it has much to do with    or    or    or    thousand new office spaces  regardless of what the number is. So yeah  I think there is a chance to re look at how we think about cities. And in fact  there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven. KA  Which was the building just north of the Towers  DR  Right  which the towers fell into. And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city. I think a public dialogue    I think  you know  I'd like to see an international competition  and a call for ideas for uses. KA  Whether it's arts  whether it's housing  whether it's what amount of shopping  DR  Right. And we're looking for other things. This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help. Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting    architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing. And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic  single solutions  and more about a multiplicity of things. KA  Before we end  I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform  DR  John Kamen    who's here  actually    put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use. So I thought that would be good to end with. DR  We're looking from Fulton Street  west. One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti graffiti he was. And essentially our structure was designed to be written on. KA  As you say  it's not a memorial. But were you conscious of memorials  The Vietnam Memorial  Those kinds of forms  DR  We certainly did as much research as we could  and we were conscious of other memorials. And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do. It's     people on the committee for Oklahoma City  which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad hoc  spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad hoc memorials in the city already. The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de mountable. What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed  so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero  but all of the buildings around it    and the scars on the building around it  which are enormous. This shows Saint Paul's on the left. KA  I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection  and its being there  almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished  is part of its extraordinary    I don't know if beauty is the word    but presence. DR  It was an honor to do. And we were thrilled to be able to show it here. I get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical Pentagon long range strategic planners. And the answer I like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war. And what I've spent    years doing in this business    and it's taken me almost    to figure it out    is I think about the future of wars in the context of everything else. So I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace. The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas. It's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit. The material was generated in two years of work I did for the Secretary of Defense  thinking about a new national grand strategy for the United States. I'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer. Here's my favorite bonehead concept from the     s in the Pentagon  the theory of anti access  area denial asymmetrical strategies. Why do we call it that  Because it's got all those A's lined up I guess. This is gobbledygook for if the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge. They're going to be small. And if they try to fight us in the traditional  straight up manner we're going to kick their ass  which is why people don't try to do that any more. I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat. He's now a one star General. That's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours. So that overmatched capability creates problems    catastrophic successes the White House calls them. And we're trying to figure that out  because it is an amazing capability. The question is  what's the good you can do with it  OK  The theory of anti access  area denial asymmetrical strategies    gobbledygook that we sell to Congress  because if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses they wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want. So we say  area denial  anti access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over. And they say   Will you build it in my district   Here's my parody and it ain't much of one. Let's talk about a battle space. I don't know  Taiwan Straits     . Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space. I don't know  the Million Man Swim. The United States has to access that battle space instantaneously. They throw up anti access  area denial asymmetrical strategies. A banana peel on the tarmac. Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly. We say   China  it's yours.  Prometheus approach  largely a geographic definition  focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict. We field the first half team in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game. That's the problem. We can run the score up against anybody  and then get our asses kicked in the second half    what they call fourth generation warfare. Here's the way I like to describe it instead. There is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access. They said we couldn't do Afghanistan. We did it with ease. They said we couldn't do Iraq. We did it with     combat casualties in six weeks. We did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse. There is nobody we can't take down. The question is  what do you do with the power  So there's no trouble accessing battle spaces. What we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow  and creating the peace space that allows us to move on. Problem is  the Defense Department over here beats the hell out of you. The State Department over here says   Come on boy  I know you can make it.  And that poor country runs off that ledge  does that cartoon thing and then drops. This is not about overwhelming force  but proportional force. It's about non lethal technologies  because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you're going to lose friends very quickly. This is not about projecting power  but about staying power  which is about legitimacy with the locals. Who do you access in this transition space  You have to create internal partners. You have to access coalition partners. We asked the Indians for        peace keepers. I know their senior leadership  they wanted to give it to us. But they said to us   You know what  In that transition space you're mostly hat not enough cattle. We don't think you can pull it off  we're not going to give you our        peace keepers for fodder.  We asked the Russians for       . They said no. I was in China in August  I said   You should have        peace keepers in Iraq. It's your oil  not ours.  Which is the truth. It's their oil. And the Chinese said to me   Dr. Barnett  you're absolutely right. In a perfect world we'd have        there. But it's not a perfect world  and your administration isn't getting us any closer.  But we have trouble accessing our outcomes. We lucked out  frankly  on the selection. We face different opponents across these three. And it's time to start admitting you can't ask the same    year old to do it all  day in and day out. It's just too damn hard. We have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. We don't do the everything else so well. Frankly  we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it. We have a brilliant Secretary of War. We don't have a Secretary of Everything Else. Because if we did  that guy would be in front of the Senate  still testifying over Abu Ghraib. The problem is he doesn't exist. There is no Secretary of Everything Else. I think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. I call that the Leviathan Force. What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else. I call them the System Administrators. What I think this really represents is lack of an A to Z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states. We have one for processing economically bankrupt states. It's the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan  OK  We argue about it every time we use it. Argentina just went through it  broke a lot of rules. They got out on the far end  we said   Fine  don't worry about it.  It's transparent. A certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non zero outcome. We don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that  frankly  everybody wants gone. Like Saddam  like Mugabe  like Kim Jong Il    people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions. Like the         dead so far in Sudan. What would an A to Z system look like  I'm going to distinguish between what I call front half and back half. And let's call this red line  I don't know  mission accomplished. What we have extant right now  at the beginning of this system  is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury. What can they do  They can indict your ass. They can debate it. They can write it on a piece of paper. They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you  and then say in no uncertain terms   Please cut that out.  That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the     s. That gets you         dead in the Sudan in the last    months. Everybody's got to answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in Africa  and you better have an answer. We don't have anything to translate that will into action. What we do have is the U.S. enabled Leviathan Force that says   You want me to take that guy down  I'll take that guy down. I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you    billion dollars.  But here's the deal. As soon as I can't find anybody else to air out  I leave the scene immediately. That's called the Powell Doctrine. Way downstream we have the International Criminal Court. They love to put them on trial. They've got Milosevic right now. What are we missing  A functioning executive that will translate will into action  because we don't have it. Every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing. We haven't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in     . But we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we're a democracy and that's what it takes. And if that doesn't work we scream   He's got a gun   just as we rush in. And then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say   Jesus  it was dark.  Do you want to do it  France  France says   No  but I do like to criticize you after the fact.  What we need downstream is a great power enabled    what I call that Sys Admin Force. We should have had         troops streaming into Iraq on the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad. What do you get then  No looting  no military disappearing  no arms disappearing  no ammo disappearing  no Muqtada al Sadr    I'm wrecking his bones    no insurgency. Talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months. We had six months to feel the lob  to get the job done  and we dicked around for six months. And then they turned on us. Why  Because they just got fed up. They saw what we did to Saddam. They said   You're that powerful  you can resurrect this country. You're America.  What we need is an international reconstruction fund    Sebastian Mallaby  Washington Post  great idea. Model on the IMF. Instead of passing the hat each time  OK  Where are we going to find this guy  G    that's easy. Check out their agenda since     . All security dominated. They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF. You vote according to how much money you put in the kitty. Here's my challenge to the Defense Department. You've got to build this force. You've got to seed this force. You've got to track coalition partners. Create a record of success. You will get this model. You tell me it's too hard to do. I'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans. We did it just like that. I'm talking about regularizing it  making it transparent. Would you like Mugabe gone  Would you like Kim Jong Il  who's killed about two million people  would you like him gone  Would you like a better system  This is why it matters to the military. They've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War. I'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire  which I can do because I'm not inside the beltway. I'm talking about the     s. The Berlin Wall falls. We do Desert Storm. The split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with  and those who see a future that starts to scare them  like the U.S. submarine community  which watches the Soviet Navy disappear overnight. Ah  So they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self discovery and self actualization. The problem is you need a big  sexy opponent to fight against. And if you can't find one you've got to make one up. China  all grown up  going to be a looker  The rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the     s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it  military operations other than war. I ask you  who joins the military to do things other than war  Actually  most of them. Jessica Lynch never planned on shooting back. Most of them don't pick up a rifle. I maintain this is code inside the Army for   We don't want to do this.  They spent the     s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world What I call the core and the gap. The Clinton administration wasn't interested in running this. For eight years  after screwing up the relationship on day one    inauguration day with gays in the military    which was deft. So we were home alone for eight years. And what did we do home alone  We bought one military and we operated another. It's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says   Doctor  it hurts when I do this.  The doctor says   Stop doing that you idiot.  I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early     s. I'd say   You're buying one military and you're operating another  and eventually it's going to hurt. It's wrong. Bad Pentagon  bad   And they'd say   Dr. Barnett  you are so right. Can you come back next year and remind us again   Some people say      heals the rift    jerks the long term transformation gurus out of their        foot view of history  drags them down in to the muck and says   You want a networked opponent  I've got one  he's everywhere  go find him.  It elevates MOOTW    how we pronounce that acronym    from crap to grand strategy  because that's how you're going to shrink that gap. Some people put these two things together and they call it empire  which I think is a boneheaded concept. Empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets  which you cannot do  but maximum rule sets which you must do. It's not our system of governance. Never how we've sought to interact with the outside world. I prefer that phrase System Administration. We enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy. Certain bad things you cannot do. How this impacts the way we think about the future of war. This is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the Pentagon. It makes me very popular as well. Everybody's got an opinion. Going back to the beginning of our country    historically  defenses meant protection of the homeland. Security has meant everything else. Written into our constitution  two different forces  two different functions. Raise an army when you need it  and maintain a navy for day to day connectivity. A Department of War  a Department of Everything Else. A big stick  a baton stick. Can of whup ass  the networking force. In      we merged these two things together in the Defense Department. Our long term rationale becomes  we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets. To attack America is to risk blowing up the world. We connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay. That's not our problem now. They can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow and we don't go to the mattresses with nukes. That's the scary part. The question is how do we reconnect American national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable  and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet  What's happened since is that bifurcation I described. We talked about this going all the way back to the end of the Cold War. Let's have a Department of War  and a Department of Something Else. Some people say   Hell       did it for you.  Now we've got a home game and an away game. The Department of Homeland Security is a strategic feel good measure. It's going to be the Department of Agriculture for the   st century. TSA    thousands standing around. Just be grateful Robert Reed didn't shove that bomb up his ass. Because we'd all be gay then. I supported the war in Iraq. He was a bad guy with multiple priors. It's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him. I knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force. I knew we'd have a hard time with what followed. But I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure. What do I mean by these two different forces  This is the Hobbesian Force. I love this force. I don't want to see it go. That plus nukes rules out great power war. This is the military the rest of the world wants us to build. It's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries. What does this mean  It means you've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same    year old. Switching back  morning  afternoon  evening  morning  afternoon  evening. Handing out aid  shooting back  handing out aid  shooting back. It's too much. The    year olds get tired from the switching  OK  That force on the left  you can train a    year old to do that. That force on the right is more like a    year old cop. You need the experience. What does this mean in terms of operations  The rule is going to be this. That Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home  does most of your work. You break out that Leviathan Force only every so often. But here's the promise you make to the American public  to your own people  to the world. You break out that Leviathan Force  you promise  you guarantee that you're going to mount one hell of a    immediately    follow on Sys Admin effort. Don't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace. Other differences. Leviathan traditional partners  they all look like the Brits and their former colonies. Including us  I would remind you. The rest    wider array of partners. International organizations  non governmental organizations  private voluntary organizations  contractors. You're not going to get away from that. Leviathan Force  it's all about joint operations between the military services. We're done with that. What we need to do is inter agency operations  which frankly Condi Rice was in charge of. And I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed. I call the Leviathan Force your dad's military. I like them young  male  unmarried  slightly pissed off. I call the Sys Admin Force your mom's military. It's everything the man's military hates. Gender balanced much more  older  educated  married with children. The force on the left  up or out. The force on the right  in and out. The force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the U.S. The force on the right's going to obliterate it. That's where the National Guard's going to be. The force on the left is never coming under the purview of the International Criminal Court. Sys Admin Force has to. Different definitions of network centricity. One takes down networks  one puts them up. And you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that. Do we need a bigger budget  Do we need a draft to pull this off  Absolutely not. I've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years  we can do it faster  cheaper  smaller  just as lethal. I say   Great  I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide.  Here's the larger point. You're going to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U.S. Military first. But ultimately you're going to civilianize it  probably two thirds. Inter agency ize it  internationalize it. So yes  it begins inside the Pentagon  but over time it's going to cross that river. I have been to the mountain top. I can see the future. I may not live long enough to get you there  but it's going to happen. We're going to have a Department of Something Else between war and peace. Last slide. Who gets custody of the kids  This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense. And this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk. Read Max Boon. This is the history of the marines    small wars  small arms. The Marines are like my West Highland Terrier. They get up every morning  they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something. I don't want my Marines handing out aid. I want them to be Marines. That's what keeps the Sys Admin Force from being a pussy force. It keeps it from being the U.N. You shoot at these people the Marines are going to come over and kill you. Department of Navy  strategic subs go this way  surface combatants are over there  and the news is they may actually be that small. I call it the Smart Dust Navy. I tell young officers   You may command     ships in your career. Bad news is they may not have anybody on them.  Carriers go both ways because they're a swing asset. You'll see the pattern    airborne  just like carriers. Armor goes this way. Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force  you can win by bombing. But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace. Shinseki was right with the argument. Air force  strategic airlift goes both ways. Bombers  fighters go over here. Special Operations Command down at Tampa. Trigger pullers go this way. Civil Affairs  that bastard child  comes over here. Return to the Army. The point about the trigger pullers and Special Operations Command. No off season  these guys are always active. They drop in  do their business  disappear. See me now. Don't talk about it later. I was never here. The world is my playground. I want to keep trigger pullers trigger happy. I want the rules to be as loose as possible. Because when the thing gets prevented in Chicago with the three million dead that perverts our political system beyond all recognition  these are the guys who are going to kill them first. So it's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that. Reserve component    National Guard reserves overwhelmingly Sys Admin. How are you going to get them to work for this force  Most firemen in this country do it for free. This is not about money. This is about being up front with these guys and gals. Last point  intelligence community    the muscle and the defense agencies go this way. What should be the CIA  open  analytical  open source should come over here. The information you need to do this is not secret. It's not secret. Read that great piece in the New Yorker about how our echo boomers     to     over in Iraq taught each other how to do Sys Admin work  over the Internet in chat rooms. They said   Al Qaeda could be listening.  They said   Well  Jesus  they already know this stuff.  Take a gift in the left hand. These are the sunglasses that don't scare people  simple stuff. Censors and transparency  the overheads go in both directions. Thanks. What I want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds  digital globes  the   D Web  the Metaverse. What does this all mean for us  What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again. It's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world. With graphics  computing power  low latencies  these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives. So the Virtual Earth initiative  and other types of these initiatives  are all about extending our current search metaphor. When you think about it  we're so constrained by browsing the Web  remembering URLs  saving favorites. As we move to search  we rely on the relevance rankings  the Web matching  the index crawling. But we want to use our brain  We want to navigate  explore  discover information. In order to do that  we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat. We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer. So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day  Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life  So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation  comprehensive  of the entire world. What we want to do is mix in all types of data. Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth  global perspective  local knowledge. So when you think about this problem  what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin  Well  we collect data from satellites  from airplanes  from ground vehicles  from people. This process is an engineering problem  a mechanical problem  a logistical problem  an operational problem. Here is an example of our aerial camera. This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones. In addition  it's multi spectral. We collect four gigabits per second of data  if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down. That's equivalent to a constellation of    satellites at highest res capacity. We fly these airplanes at       feet in the air. You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints  vantage points  angles  textures. We bring all that data back in. We sit here    you know  think about the ground vehicles  the human scale    what do you see in person  We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like type experience. I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials  kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity. So a little unknown secret is    did you see the one with the guy  he's got the Web cam  The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him. Well  a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team. But let me tell you    it doesn't affect his day job. We think a lot of good can come from this technology. This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone. We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors  disaster areas. We helped with the first responders  the search and rescue. Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth. We made it all freely available on the Web  just to    it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause. When we think about how all this comes together  it's all about software  algorithms and math. You know  we capture this imagery but to build the   D models we need to do geo positioning. We need to do geo registering of the images. We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points. Extract geometry from the images. This process is a very calculated process. In fact  it was always done manual. Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually. They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR. They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building. We do this all through software  algorithms and math    a highly automated pipeline creating these cities. We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities  and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream. We think about the user interface. What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives  An ortho view  a nadir view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model  I'll wrap up by showing you the    this is a brand new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth. What we're doing is    people like this a lot  this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data. But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the   D model. A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller. So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the   D model space. You can see all types of resolution. From here  I can slowly pan the image over. I can get the next image. I can blend and transition. By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact  I might be recording history. The freshness  the capacity. I can turn this image. I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles. What we're trying to do is build a virtual world. We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with  and really derive insights from you  from all different directions. I thank you very much for your time. I told you three things last year. I told you that the statistics of the world have not been made properly available. Because of that  we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries  which is wrong. And that animated graphics can make a difference. Things are changing and today  on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page  it says  by first of May  full access to the databases. And if I could share the image with you on the screen. So three things have happened. U.N. opened their statistic databases  and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net  so you don't have to download it any longer. And let me repeat what you saw last year. The bubbles are the countries. Here you have the fertility rate    the number of children per woman    and there you have the length of life in years. This is         those were the industrialized countries  those were developing countries. At that time there was a  we  and  them.  There was a huge difference in the world. But then it changed  and it went on quite well. And this is what happens. You can see how China is the red  big bubble. The blue there is India. And they go over all this    I'm going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how things really changed. And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here  doesn't it  Large families still  and the HIV epidemic brought down the countries like this. This is more or less what we saw last year  and this is how it will go on into the future. And I will talk on  is this possible  Because you see now  I presented statistics that don't exist. Because this is where we are. Will it be possible that this will happen  I cover my lifetime here  you know  I expect to live     years. And this is where we are today. Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world  And I would like to show that against child survival. We'll swap the axis. Here you have child mortality    that is  survival    four kids dying there      dying there. And this is GDP per capita on this axis. And this was     . And if I go back in time  I've added some historical statistics    here we go  here we go  here we go    not so much statistics     years ago. Some countries still had statistics. We are looking down in the archive  and when we are down into       there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers. But they were down here. They had       dollars per person per year. And they lost one fifth of their kids before their first birthday. So this is what happens in the world  if we play the entire world. How they got slowly richer and richer  and they add statistics. Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics  You see the importance of that  And here  children don't live longer. The last century        was bad for the kids in Europe  because most of this statistics is Europe. It was only by the turn of the century that more than    percent of the children survived their first year. This is India coming up  with the first data from India. And this is the United States moving away here  earning more money. And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here. And it moves up with Mao Tse Tung getting health  not getting so rich. There he died  then Deng Xiaoping brings money. It moves this way over here. And the bubbles keep moving up there  and this is what the world looks like today. Let us have a look at the United States. We have a function here    I can tell the world   Stay where you are.  And I take the United States    we still want to see the background    I put them up like this  and now we go backwards. And we can see that the United States goes to the right of the mainstream. They are on the money side all the time. And down in       the United States was a neighbor of India    present  contemporary India. And that means United States was richer  but lost more kids than India is doing today  proportionally. And look here    compare to the Philippines of today. The Philippines of today has almost the same economy as the United States during the First World War. But we have to bring United States forward quite a while to find the same health of the United States as we have in the Philippines. About      here  the health of the United States is the same as the Philippines. And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized  is that Asia  Arabic countries  Latin America  are much more ahead in being healthy  educated  having human resources than they are economically. There's a discrepancy in what's happening today in the emerging economies. There now  social benefits  social progress  are going ahead of economical progress. And         the United States had the same economy as Chile has today. And how long do we have to bring United States to get the same health as Chile has today  I think we have to go  there    we have       or         the United States has the same health as Chile. Chile's catching up  Within some years Chile may have better child survival than the United States. This is really a change  that you have this lag of more or less        years' difference on the health. And behind the health is the educational level. And there's a lot of infrastructure things  and general human resources are there. Now we can take away this    and I would like to show you the rate of speed  the rate of change  how fast they have gone. And we go back to       and I want to look at Japan. And I want to look at Sweden and the United States. And I'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here and the red Toyota down there  and the brownish Volvo. And here we go. Here we go. The Toyota has a very bad start down here  you can see  and the United States Ford is going off road there. And the Volvo is doing quite fine. This is the war. The Toyota got off track  and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden    can you see that  And they are taking over Sweden  and they are now healthier than Sweden. That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota. And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan. They really caught up. And this changes gradually. We have to look over generations to understand it. And let me show you my own sort of family history    we made these graphs here. And this is the same thing  money down there  and health  you know  And this is my family. This is Sweden        when my great great grandma was born. Sweden was like Sierra Leone today. And this is when great grandma was born      . And Sweden was like Mozambique. And this is when my grandma was born      . She took care of me as a child  so I'm not talking about statistic now    now it's oral history in my family. That's when I believe statistics  when it's grandma verified statistics. I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics. Sweden was like Ghana. It's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub Saharan Africa. I told you last year  I'll tell you again  my mother was born in Egypt  and I    who am I  I'm the Mexican in the family. And my daughter  she was born in Chile  and the grand daughter was born in Singapore  now the healthiest country on this Earth. It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago  with better child survival. But they're very small  you know  They're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests. But homage to Singapore. Singapore is the best one. Now this looks also like a very good story. But it's not really that easy  that it's all a good story. Because I have to show you one of the other facilities. We can also make the color here represent the variable    and what am I choosing here  Carbon dioxide emission  metric ton per capita. This is       and United States was emitting    tons per person. And China was emitting  .   and India was emitting  .   tons per capita. And what happens when we moved on  Well  you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier    everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide. There is no one who has done it so far. And we don't have all the updated data any longer  because this is really hot data today. And there we are      . And in the discussion I attended with global leaders  you know  many say now the problem is that the emerging economies  they are getting out too much carbon dioxide. The Minister of the Environment of India said   Well  you were the one who caused the problem.  The OECD countries    the high income countries    they were the ones who caused the climate change.  But we forgive you  because you didn't know it. But from now on  we count per capita. From now on we count per capita. And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission.  This really shows you  we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate. And this is really what has to be changed. I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world  but I don't think it's like this. The world is quite a messy place. This we can call Dollar Street. Everyone lives on this street here. What they earn here    what number they live on    is how much they earn per day. This family earns about one dollar per day. We drive up the street here  we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day. And we drive away here    we find the first garden in the street  and they earn    to    dollars a day. And how do they live  If we look at the bed here  we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor. This is what poverty line is       percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs  the food for the day. This is two to five dollars. You have a bed. And here it's a much nicer bedroom  you can see. I lectured on this for Ikea  and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here. And this is the sofa  how it will emerge from there. And the interesting thing  when you go around here in the photo panorama  you see the family still sitting on the floor there. Although there is a sofa  if you watch in the kitchen  you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to    dollars. It comes beyond here  when you really can get good working conditions in the family. And if you really want to see the difference  you look at the toilet over here. This can change. This can change. These are all pictures and images from Africa  and it can become much better. We can get out of poverty. My own research has not been in IT or anything like this. I spent    years in interviews with African farmers who were on the verge of famine. And this is the result of the farmers needs research. The nice thing here is that you can't see who are the researchers in this picture. That's when research functions in poor societies    you must really live with the people. When you're in poverty  everything is about survival. It's about having food. And these two young farmers  they are girls now    because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS    they discuss with a trained agronomist. This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi  Junatambe Kumbira  and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant    the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found. And they are very  very eagerly interested to get advice  and that's to survive in poverty. That's one context. Getting out of poverty. The women told us one thing.  Get us technology. We hate this mortar  to stand hours and hours. Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour  then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves.  Technology will bring you out of poverty  but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty. And this woman is very happy now  bringing her products to the market. But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count  and won't be cheated when she reaches the market. She wants her kid to be healthy  so she can go to the market and doesn't have to stay home. And she wants the infrastructure    it is nice with a paved road. It's also good with credit. Micro credits gave her the bicycle  you know. And information will tell her when to go to market with which product. You can do this. I find my experience from    years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible. Africa has not done bad. In    years they've gone from a pre Medieval situation to a very decent     year ago Europe  with a functioning nation and state. I would say that sub Saharan Africa has done best in the world during the last    years. Because we don't consider where they came from. It's this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us  Argentina and Mozambique together    years ago  and says that Mozambique did worse. We have to know a little more about the world. I have a neighbor who knows     types of wine. He knows everything. He knows the name of the grape  the temperature and everything. I only know two types of wine    red and white. But my neighbor only knows two types of countries    industrialized and developing. And I know      I know about the small data. But you can do that. But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious  You make a PowerPoint  you know  Homage to the Office package  no  What is this  what is this  what am I telling  I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development. Everyone wants your pet thing. If you are in the corporate sector  you love micro credit. If you are fighting in a non governmental organization  you love equity between gender. Or if you are a teacher  you'll love UNESCO  and so on. On the global level  we have to have more than our own thing. We need everything. All these things are important for development  especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare. Now  what we need to think about is  what is a goal for development  and what are the means for development  Let me first grade what are the most important means. Economic growth to me  as a public health professor  is the most important thing for development because it explains    percent of survival. Governance. To have a government which functions    that's what brought California out of the misery of     . It was the government that made law function finally. Education  human resources are important. Health is also important  but not that much as a mean. Environment is important. Human rights is also important  but it just gets one cross. Now what about goals  Where are we going toward  We are not interested in money. Money is not a goal. It's the best mean  but I give it zero as a goal. Governance  well it's fun to vote in a little thing  but it's not a goal. And going to school  that's not a goal  it's a mean. Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy    at my age especially    you can stand here  you're healthy. And that's good  it gets two plusses. Environment is very  very crucial. There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up. But where are the important goals  Of course  it's human rights. Human rights is the goal  but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development. And culture. Culture is the most important thing  I would say  because that's what brings joy to life. That's the value of living. So the seemingly impossible is possible. Even African countries can achieve this. And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible. And remember  please remember my main message  which is this  the seemingly impossible is possible. We can have a good world. I showed you the shots  I proved it in the PowerPoint  and I think I will convince you also by culture. Bring me my sword  Sword swallowing is from ancient India. It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious. And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel    solid steel    this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army        in the last year we had war. And it's all solid steel    you can hear here. And I'm going to take this blade of steel  and push it down through my body of blood and flesh  and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible. Can I request a moment of absolute silence  First place I'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss. And I say believe because this process is still ongoing. Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I'll talk a little bit about. One of the things that's changed here  in the last     years since Jules Verne had great science fiction concepts of what the underworld was like  is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about. We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity. Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight. When you go on a thing like this  we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months  with a team as small as    or     to as big as    . And a lot of people ask me  you know  what kind of people do you get for a project like this  While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA  it's nonetheless thorough. We're looking for competence  discipline  endurance  and strength. In case you're wondering  this is our strength test. But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations. We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance. From the entrance  this is nothing like a commercial cave. You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J   not K   but J . We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point. And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse  except that you're now running a string of these things down. The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you're down there  otherwise in damp  moist  cold conditions in utterly dark places. I should mention that everything you're seeing here  by the way  is artificially illuminated at great effort. Otherwise it is completely dark in these places. The deeper you go  the more you run into a conflict with water. It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down. And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice. So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late     s. So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico. Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous. We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film. Along that same line  I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year  we have never seen monsters underground    at least the kind that eat you. If there is a monster underground  it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance. Next year I'll be leading an international team to J . We're going to be shooting from minus       meters    that's a little over       feet down    at    kilometers from the entrance. The lead crews will be underground for pushing    days straight. I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time. Eventually  if you keep going down in these things  probability says that you're going to run into a place like this. It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof. And when you used to find these things  they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon. Now I remember that term really well for two reasons. Number one  it's the name of my rock band  and second  is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor. And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this. This is some life support equipment closed cycle. And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of     meters straight down underwater. When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA. It's like doing extra vehicular activity in space  but at much greater distances  and at much greater physical peril. So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range  away from a safe haven. Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in     . of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before. This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet. To experience it is a privilege. Bill Stone  That was taken in Wakulla Springs  Florida. Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before     . It was developed within a two year period and used on actual exploratory projects. This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper  and it produced the first three dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave  and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs. It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world. This is Europa. Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day. This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there. For those who have never seen this story  Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago  called  Aliens of the Deep.  There was a brief clip    would be the ultimate robotic challenge. Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light  it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle. It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice. Now we have to get through the ice. You need a melt probe. It's basically a nuclear heated torpedo. The ice could be anywhere from three to    miles deep. Week after week  the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice  until finally    Now  what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean  You need an AUV  an autonomous underwater vehicle. It needs to be one smart puppy  able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean. BS  What Jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV. I mean  I cut through three years of engineering meetings  design and system integration  and introduced DEPTHX    Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer. And as the movie says  this is one smart puppy. It's got    sensors     onboard computers          lines of behavioral autonomy code  packs more than    kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent. This is the target site  the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico. It's been explored to a depth of     meters and beyond that nobody knows anything. This is part of DEPTHX's mission. There are two primary targets we're doing here. One is  how do you do science autonomy underground  How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist  There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about  but basically we drive through the space  we populate it with environmental variables    sulphide  halide  things like that. We calculate gradient surfaces  and drive the bot over to a wall where there's a high probability of life. We move along the wall  in what's called proximity operations  looking for changes in color. If we see something that looks interesting  we pull it into a microscope. If it passes the microscopic test  we go for a collection. We either draw in a liquid sample  or we can actually take a solid core from the wall. No hands at the wheel. This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own. The real hat trick for this vehicle  though  is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed  known as  D SLAM  for simultaneous localization and mapping. DEPTHX is an all seeing eyeball. Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time  allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor lock on what it's gone through already. What I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done. This May  we're going to go from minus       meters in Zacaton  and if we're very lucky  DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically discovered division of bacteria. The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then  if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go  we could potentially launch by       and by      we may have the first evidence of life off this planet. What then of manned space exploration  The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by     . The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots. It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were    years ago. Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime. What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas. And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here. There are three underpinnings of working in space privately. One of them is the requirement for economical earth to space transport. The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them. Go  go  go. The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit. Orbital hotels to start with  but workshops for the rest of us later on. The final missing piece  the real paradigm buster  is this  a gas station on orbit. It's not going to look like that. If it existed  it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning. Now  to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement  I've got to give you the basics of Space    . And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram. Anybody drink one of these here this week  You'd pay        dollars for that in orbit. That's more than you pay for TED  if Google dropped their sponsorship. The second is more than    percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant. Thus  every time you'd want to do anything in space  you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator. Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics. So  what if you could get your gas at a   th the price  There is a place where you can. In fact  you can get it better    you can get it at    times lower if you can find propellant on the moon. There is a little known mission that was launched by the Pentagon     years ago now  called Clementine. And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon. That signal was so strong  it could only have been produced by    trillion tons of water buried in the sediment  collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material. If we're going to get that  and make that gas station possible  we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space. We can't do that right now. The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground  and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces. We have to beat that. We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics. We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything. This is an idea that  again  came out of Livermore back in       with Dr. Lowell Wood's group. And we can extend that now to just about everything. Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit. We can go much further. We can build space tugs  orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water. There's another thing. When you're coming back from the moon  you have to deal with orbital mechanics. It says you're moving        feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station. You got two choices. You can burn rocket fuel to get there  or you can do something really incredible. You can dive into the stratosphere  and precisely dissipate that velocity  and come back out to the space station. It has never been done. It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride    better than Disney. The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency. If you try to do that for the moon  you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there. But if you send a mining team there  without the return propellant  first    Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez  This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty. I like this equipment  you know  and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear. But  if you were truly bold you could get it there  manufacture it  and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done. There's a myth that you can't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and    years. That's not true. In seven years  we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low earth orbit. We're living in one of the most exciting times in history. We're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space. The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration. To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed. We can do it by jump starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater  to mine the moon for resources  and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit. Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing. I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED. I intend to lead that expedition. It can be done in seven years with the right backing. Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who  had they been here today  would have heartily approved. There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier. We have collectively forgotten that lesson. Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.     years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words  I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier  in our time  for all of us. Thank you.
