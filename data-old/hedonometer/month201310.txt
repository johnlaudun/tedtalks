I think it's safe to say that all humans will be intimate with death at least once in their lives. But what if that intimacy began long before you faced your own transition from life into death  What would life be like if the dead literally lived alongside you  In my husband's homeland in the highlands of Sulawesi island in eastern Indonesia  there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process. In Tana Toraja  the most important social moments in people's lives  the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners  but funerals. So these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals    pigs  chickens and  most importantly  water buffalo    that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased. So this cultural complex surrounding death  the ritual enactment of the end of life  has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape. Lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks  funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair  where commemorating someone who's died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition. And it's a transition that's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead. So every year  thousands of visitors come to Tana Toraja to see  as it were  this culture of death  and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the West. So even as we share death as a universal experience  it's not experienced the same way the world over. And as an anthropologist  I see these differences in experience being rooted in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us. So where we see an unquestionable reality  death as an irrefutable biological condition  Torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis. So again  the physical cessation of life is not the same as death. In fact  a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased. And this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone's participation. So after a person's physical death  their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence  which is called the tongkonan. And the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family's identity but also of the human life cycle from birth to death. So essentially  the shape of the building that you're born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place. Until the funeral ceremony  which can be held years after a person's physical death  the deceased is referred to as  to makala   a sick person  or  to mama   a person who is asleep  and they continue to be a member of the household. They are symbolically fed and cared for  and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions  which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as Puya. So I know what some of you must be thinking right now. Is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives  And that's exactly what I'm saying. But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction we have to this idea of proximity to bodies  proximity to death  or how this notion just does not fit into our very biological or medical sort of definition of death  I like to think about what the Torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out. I think that Torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true despite the widespread acceptance of the biomedical definition of death  and that is that our relationships with other humans  their impact on our social reality  doesn't cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body  that there's a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed but not ended. So Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship by lavishing love and attention on the most visible symbol of that relationship  the human body. So my husband has fond memories of talking to and playing with and generally being around his deceased grandfather  and for him there is nothing unnatural about this. This is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their relationship to the deceased  and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who's living to relating to the deceased as a person who's an ancestor. And here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors  so these are people who have already been buried  already had a funeral ceremony. These are called tau tau. So the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death. It ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities. And it's also a moment of self awareness. It's a moment when people think about who they are  their place in society  and their role in the life cycle in accordance with Torajan cosmology. There's a saying in Toraja that all people will become grandparents  and what this means is that after death  we all become part of the ancestral line that anchors us between the past and the present and will define who our loved ones are into the future. So essentially  we all become grandparents to the generations of human children that come after us. And this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial buffaloes that are thought to carry people's soul from here to the afterlife  and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt for all of the years their parents spent investing and caring for them. But the sacrifice of buffalo and the ritual display of wealth also exhibits the status of the deceased  and  by extension  the deceased's family. So at funerals  relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place  its impact on life and the relationships of the living. So all of this focus on death doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire to the ideal of a long life. They engage in many practices thought to confer good health and survival to an advanced age. But they don't put much stock in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness or in old age. It's said in Toraja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life. It's called the sunga'. And like a thread  it should be allowed to unspool to its natural end. So by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric of life  people's everyday decisions about their health and healthcare are affected. The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan  Nenet Katcha  is now approaching the age of      as far as we can tell. And there are increasing signs that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya. And his death will be greatly mourned. But I know that my husband's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives  when they can ritually recount his life's narrative  weaving his story into the history of their community. His story is their story. His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves. And it's a story that has no discernible beginning  no foreseeable end. It's a story that goes on long after his body no longer does. People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed by participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn. But I see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one. In reality  the relationship between the living and the dead has its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system  where decisions about how long to stretch the thread of life are made based on our emotional and social ties with the people around us  not just on medicine's ability to prolong life. We  like the Torajans  base our decisions about life on the meanings and the definitions that we ascribe to death. So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the Torajans. It might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the United States. But I want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process but as part of the greater human story. What would it be like to look on the expired human form with love because it's so intimately a part of who we all are  If we could expand our definition of death to encompass life  we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear. Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the U.S. healthcare system  particularly in the end of life care  is as simple as a shift in perspective  and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every death. It might help us recognize that the way we limit our conversation about death to something that's medical or biological is reflective of a larger culture that we all share of avoiding death  being afraid of talking about it. If we could entertain and value other kinds of knowledge about life  including other definitions of death  it has the potential to change the discussions that we have about the end of life. It could change the way that we die  but more importantly  it could transform the way that we live. So my name is Amy Webb  and a few years ago I found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion. And I thought  what's wrong with me  I don't understand why this keeps happening. So I asked everybody in my life what they thought. I turned to my grandmother  who always had plenty of advice  and she said   Stop being so picky. You've got to date around. And most importantly  true love will find you when you least expect it.  Now as it turns out  I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data  as you'll soon find. I am constantly swimming in numbers  formulas and charts. I also have a very tight knit family  and I'm very  very close with my sister  and as a result  I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up. So I'm at the end of this bad breakup  I'm    years old  I figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months before I'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of cohabitate  and we have to do that for a while before we can get engaged. And if I want to start having children by the time I'm     that meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago. So that wasn't going to work. If my strategy was to least expect my way into true love  then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity. In short  I was trying to figure out what's the probability of my finding Mr. Right  Well  at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia  and it's a big city  and I figured  in this entire place  there are lots of possibilities. So again  I started doing some math. Population of Philadelphia  it has  .  million people. I figure about half of that are men  so that takes the number down to        . I'm looking for a guy between the ages of    and     which was only four percent of the population  so now I'm dealing with the possibility of        men. I was looking for somebody who was Jewish  because I am and that was important to me. That's only  .  percent of the population. I figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of    of those men  and there was no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer. So that basically meant there were    men for me that I could possibly date in the entire city of Philadelphia. In the meantime  my very large Jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children  and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already. So I have two possible strategies at this point I'm sort of figuring out. One  I can take my grandmother's advice and sort of least expect my way into maybe bumping into the one out of    possible men in the entire  .  million person city of Philadelphia  or I could try online dating. Now  I like the idea of online dating  because it's predicated on an algorithm  and that's really just a simple way of saying I've got a problem  I'm going to use some data  run it through a system and get to a solution. So online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other  but as it turns out  algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture. In fact  in Judaism  there were matchmakers a long time ago  and though they didn't have an explicit algorithm per se  they definitely were running through formulas in their heads  like  is the girl going to like the boy  Are the families going to get along  What's the rabbi going to say  Are they going to start having children right away  The matchmaker would sort of think through all of this  put two people together  and that would be the end of it. So in my case  I thought  well  will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming  So I decided to sign on. Now  there was one small catch. As I'm signing on to the various dating websites  as it happens  I was really  really busy. But that actually wasn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind  and I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes. So I just copied and pasted from my r sum . So in the descriptive part up top  I said that I was an award winning journalist and a future thinker. When I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date  I said monetization and fluency in Japanese. I talked a lot about JavaScript. So obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward. But the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date. These algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates    what turned out to be truly awful dates. There was this guy Steve  the I.T. guy. The algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets  we share a love of math and data and '  s music  and so I agreed to go out with him. So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out to one of Philadelphia's white table cloth  extremely expensive restaurants. And we went in  and right off the bat  our conversation really wasn't taking flight  but he was ordering a lot of food. In fact  he didn't even bother looking at the menu. He was ordering multiple appetizers  multiple entr es  for me as well  and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table  also lots and lots of bottles of wine. So we're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner  and I've decided Steve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other  but we'll part ways as friends  when he gets up to go to the bathroom  and in the meantime  the bill comes to our table. And listen  I'm a modern woman. I am totally down with splitting the bill. But then Steve the I.T. guy didn't come back. And that was my entire month's rent. So needless to say  I was not having a good night. So I run home  I call my mother  I call my sister  and as I do  at the end of each one of these terrible  terrible dates  I regale them with the details. And they say to me   Stop complaining.   You're just being too picky.  So I said  fine  from here on out I'm only going on dates where I know there's Wi Fi  and I'm bringing my laptop. I'm going to shove it into my bag  I'm going to have this email template  and I'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically  these dates really are terrible. So I started tracking things like really stupid  awkward  sexual remarks  bad vocabulary  the number of times a man forced me to high five him. So I started to crunch some numbers  and that allowed me to make some correlations. So as it turns out  for some reason  men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately. Well  it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys. There were just bad for me. And as it happens  the algorithms that were setting us up  they weren't bad either. These algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do  which was to take our user generated information  in my case  my r sum   and match it up with other people's information. See  the real problem here is that  while the algorithms work just fine  you and I don't  when confronted with blank windows where we're supposed to input our information online. Very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves. The other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like  are you a dog person or a cat person  Do you like horror films or romance films  I'm not looking for a pen pal. I'm looking for a husband. Right  So there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data. So I said fine  I've got a new plan. I'm going to keep using these online dating sites  but I'm going to treat them as databases  and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up  I think I'm going to try reverse engineering this entire system. So knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people  I decided instead to ask my own questions. What was every single possible thing that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate  So I started writing and writing and writing  and at the end  I had amassed    different data points. I wanted somebody was Jew ish  so I was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture  but wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday. I wanted somebody who worked hard  because work for me is extremely important  but not too hard. For me  the hobbies that I have are really just new work projects that I've launched. I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children  but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do  so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three  and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it. So things like that  but I also wanted somebody who would go to far flung  exotic places  like Petra  Jordan. I also wanted somebody who would weigh    pounds more than me at all times  regardless of what I weighed. So I now have these    different data points  which  to be fair  is a lot. So what I did was  I went through and I prioritized that list. I broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points  and I ranked everything starting at     and going all the way down to     and listing things like I was looking for somebody who was really smart  who would challenge and stimulate me  and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points. These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal breakers. So once I had all this done  I then built a scoring system  because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online would be a match with me. I figured there would be a minimum of     points before I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message. For     points  I'd agree to go out on a date  and I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the       point threshold. Well  as it turns out  this worked pretty well. So I go back online now. I found Jewishdoc   who's incredibly good looking  incredibly well spoken  he had hiked Mt. Fuji  he had walked along the Great Wall. He likes to travel as long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship. And I thought  I've done it  I've cracked the code. I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming of my family's dreams. There was only one problem  He didn't like me back. And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered is the competition. Who are all of the other women on these dating sites  I found SmileyGirl    . She said she was a  Fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing.  She listed her job as  teacher.  She said she is  silly  nice and friendly.  She likes to make people laugh  alot.  At this moment I knew  clicking profile after profile that looked like this  that I needed to do some market research. So I created    fake male profiles. Now  before I lose all of you    understand that I did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system. I didn't carry on crazy Catfish style relationships with anybody. I really was just scraping their data. But I didn't want everybody's data. I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that I really  really wanted to marry. When I released these men into the wild  I did follow some rules. So I didn't reach out to any woman first. I just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract  and mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets. So I was looking at qualitative data  so what was the humor  the tone  the voice  the communication style that these women shared in common  And also quantitative data  so what was the average length of their profile  how much time was spent between messages  What I was trying to get at here was that I figured  in person  I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl    . I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online. Well  one month later  I had a lot of data  and I was able to do another analysis. And as it turns out  content matters a lot. So smart people tend to write a lot                        words about themselves  which may all be very  very interesting. The challenge here  though  is that the popular men and women are sticking to    words on average that are written very  very well  even though it may not seem like it all the time. The other hallmark of the people who do this well is that they're using non specific language. So in my case   The English Patient  is my most favorite movie ever  but it doesn't work to use that in a profile  because that's a superficial data point  and somebody may disagree and decide they don't want to go out because they didn't like sitting through the three hour movie. Also  optimistic language matters a lot. So this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women  words like  fun  and  girl  and  love.  And what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile. Remember  I'm somebody who said that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript and I was okay with that. The difference is that it's about being more approachable and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you. And as it turns out  timing is also really  really important. Just because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number or their instant message account and it's   o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake  doesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people. The popular women on these online sites spend an average of    hours in between each communication. And that's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship. And finally    there were the photos. All of the women who were popular showed some skin. They all looked really great  which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what I had uploaded. Once I had all of this information  I was able to create a super profile  so it was still me  but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem. And as it turns out  I did a really good job. I was the most popular person online. And as it turns out  lots and lots of men wanted to date me. So I call my mom  I call my sister  I call my grandmother. I'm telling them about this fabulous news  and they say   This is wonderful  How soon are you going out   I said   Actually  I'm not going to go out with anybody.  Because remember  in my scoring system  they have to reach a minimum threshold of     points  and none of them have done that. They said   What  You're still being too damn picky.  Well  not too long after that  I found this guy  Thevenin  and he said that he was culturally Jewish  he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter  which I thought was very clever. He talked in detail about travel. He made a lot of really interesting cultural references. He looked and talked exactly like what I wanted  and immediately  he scored     points. It was enough for a date. Three weeks later  we met up in person for what turned out to be a    hour long conversation that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant  and when he dropped me back off at my house that night I re scored him           points   Thought  you know what  this entire time  I haven't been picky enough. Well  a year and a half after that  we were non cruise ship traveling through Petra  Jordan  when he got down on his knee and proposed. A year after that  we were married  and about a year and a half after that  our daughter  Petra  was born. Audience  Oh   What it means...  Obviously  I'm having a fabulous life  so    The question is  what does all of this mean for you  Well  as it turns out  there is an algorithm for love. It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online. In fact  it's something that you write yourself. So whether you're looking for a husband or a wife or you're trying to find your passion or you're trying to start a business  all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules  and feel free to be as picky as you want. Well  on my wedding day  I had a conversation again with my grandmother  and she said   All right  maybe I was wrong. It looks like you did come up with a really  really great system. Now  your matzah balls ... They should be fluffy  not hard.  And I'll take her advice on that. An image is worth more than a thousand words  so I'm going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that I recently captured. So by now  my talk is already       words long  and I feel like I should stop here. At the same time  I probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw. What I am trying to do as a photographer  as an artist  is to bring the world of art and science together. Whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it's bursting  as you can see in this image  whether it's a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint  strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways  or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces  I'm always trying to link those two fields together. What I find very intriguing about those two is that they both look at the same thing  They are a response to their surroundings. And yet  they do it in a very different way. If you look at science on one hand  science is a very rational approach to its surroundings  whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings. What I am trying to do is I'm trying to bring those two views into one so that my images both speak to the viewer's heart but also to the viewer's brain. Let me demonstrate this based on three projects. The first one has to do with making sound visible. Now as you may know  sound travels in waves  so if you have a speaker  a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal  transform it into a vibration  which is then transported through the air  is captured by our ear  and transformed into an audio signal again. Now I was thinking  how can I make those sound waves visible  So I came up with the following setup. I took a speaker  I placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker  and then I added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker. And now  if I would play a sound through that speaker  it would cause the crystals to move up and down. Now this happens very fast  in the blink of an eye  so  together with LG  we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than       frames per second. Let me show you what this looks like. Thank you very much. I agree  it looks pretty amazing. But I have to tell you a funny story. I got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in Los Angeles. Now in Los Angeles  you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches  but I got mine indoors  and what happened is that  if you're shooting at       frames per second  you need to have a silly amount of light  lots of lights. So we had this speaker set up  and we had the camera facing it  and lots of lights pointing at the speaker  and I would set up the speaker  put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker  and we would do this over and over again  and it was until midday that I realized that I had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker. What was so funny about it was that the speaker was only coming from the right side  so the right side of my face was completely red and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera for the rest of the week. Let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances. Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid  Ah  some of you have. Excellent. Should I skip that part  Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior. It's a liquid that is completely black. It's got an oily consistency. And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it  which makes it magnetic. So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field  it would change its appearance. Now I've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you. So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate  and underneath that plate  there is a magnet. Now I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet. Let's just slightly move it to the right and maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent. So what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes. This is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles inside the liquid. Now this looks already quite interesting  but let me now add some watercolors to it. Those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with. You wouldn't paint with syringes  but it works just the same. So what happened now is  when the watercolor was flowing into the structure  the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid. That's because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic. That means it doesn't mix with the water. And at the same time  it tries to maintain its position above the magnet  and therefore  it creates those amazing looking structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint. So that was the second project. Let me now turn to the last project  which involves the national beverage of Scotland. This image  and also this one  were made using whiskey. Now you might ask yourself  how did he do that  Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper  I can assure you I was fully conscious while I was taking those pictures. Now  whiskey contains    percent of alcohol  and alcohol has got some very interesting properties. Maybe you have experienced some of those properties before  but I am talking about the physical properties  not the other ones. So when I open the bottle  the alcohol molecules would spread in the air  and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance. And at the same time  alcohol is highly flammable. And it was with those two properties that I was able to create the images that you're seeing right now. Let me demonstrate this over here. And what I have here is an empty glass vessel. It's got nothing in it. And now I'm going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey. Add some more. Now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle. And now  let's set that on fire. So that's all that happens. It goes really fast  and it's not that impressive. I could do it again to show it one more time  but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey  and that I should rather drink it. But let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what I just showed you in this live demonstration. So what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom  burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol. So the images that you saw at the beginning  they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle  and you have to imagine it was flipped around     degrees. So that's how those images were made. Thank you. So  I have now showed you three projects  and you might ask yourself  what is it good for  What's the idea behind it  Is it just a waste of whiskey  Is it just some strange materials  Those three projects  they're based on very simple scientific phenomena  such as magnetism  the sound waves  or over here  the physical properties of a substance  and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way  and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us. Thank you very much. So  we used to solve big problems. On July   st        Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo   's lunar module and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong and Aldrin were alone  but their presence on the moon's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive  collective effort. The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States. To get to the moon  NASA spent around     billion dollars in today's money  or four percent of the federal budget. Apollo employed around         people and demanded the collaboration of        companies  universities and government agencies. People died  including the crew of Apollo  . But before the Apollo program ended     men flew to the moon. Twelve walked on its surface  of whom Aldrin  following the death of Armstrong last year  is now the most senior. So why did they go  They didn't bring much back      pounds of old rocks  and something all    later emphasized    a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home. Why did they go  The cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets. But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in      provide a better clue. Why choose this as our goal  And they may well ask  why climb the highest mountain  Why     years ago  fly the Atlantic  Why does Rice play Texas  We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade  and do the other things  not because they are easy  but because they are hard. Jason Pontin  To contemporaries  Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East in the Cold War. At the time  the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology. They went because it was a big thing to do. Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs. The first half of the   th century produced the assembly line and the airplane  penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis. In the middle years of the century  polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated. Technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler in      called  accelerative thrust.  For most of human history  we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail  but in       the crew of Apollo    flew at        miles an hour. Since       no human beings have been back to the moon. No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo     and blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve  such as going to Mars  creating clean energy  curing cancer  or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard. I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo   . I was five years old  and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket. I vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions  but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime. So  Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology  has become a commonplace. You hear it all the time. We've heard it over the last two days here at TED. It feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys  with things like iPhones and apps and social media  or algorithms that speed automated trading. There's nothing wrong with most of these things. They've expanded and enriched our lives. But they don't solve humanity's big problems. What happened  So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley  which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel  Microsoft  Apple and Genentech. Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame  in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs. Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems. But I don't think that explanation is good enough. It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley. Even when venture capitalists were at their most risk happy  they preferred small investments  tiny investments that offered an exit within    years. V.C.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy  and V.C.s have never  never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value. No  the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound. Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems. We could go to Mars if we want. NASA even has the outline of a plan. But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal  and that will never happen. We won't go to Mars  because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth. Sometimes  we can't solve big problems because our political systems fail. Today  less than two percent of the world's energy consumption derives from advanced  renewable sources such as solar  wind and biofuels  less than two percent  and the reason is purely economic. Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind  and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels. We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price. None exist. Now  technologists  business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy  mostly  a significant increase in energy research and development  and some kind of price on carbon. But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus. Sometimes  big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so. Famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply. But    years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution. Technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food  but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments. Finally  big problems sometimes elude solution because we don't really understand the problem. President Nixon declared war on cancer in       but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer  most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy  and it is only in the last    years that effective  viable therapies have come to seem real. Hard problems are hard. It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology. We can  we must  but these four elements must all be present  Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem  institutions must support its solution  It must really be a technological problem  and we must understand it. The Apollo mission  which has become a kind of metaphor for technology's capacity to solve big problems  met these criteria. But it is an irreproducible model for the future. It is not     . There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War  no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous  and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system. Most of all  going to the moon turned out to be easy. It was just three days away. And arguably it wasn't even solving much of a problem. We are left alone with our day  and the solutions of the future will be harder won. God knows  we don't lack for the challenges. Thank you very much. I think we're all aware that the world today is full of problems. We've been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades. Serious problems  big problems  pressing problems. Poor nutrition  access to water  climate change  deforestation  lack of skills  insecurity  not enough food  not enough healthcare  pollution. There's problem after problem  and I think what really separates this time from any time I can remember in my brief time on Earth is the awareness of these problems. We're all very aware. Why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems  That's the question I've been struggling with  coming from my very different perspective. I'm not a social problem guy. I'm a guy that works with business  helps business make money. God forbid. So why are we having so many problems with these social problems  and really is there any role for business  and if so  what is that role  I think that in order to address that question  we have to step back and think about how we've understood and pondered both the problems and the solutions to these great social challenges that we face. Now  I think many have seen business as the problem  or at least one of the problems  in many of the social challenges we face. You know  think of the fast food industry  the drug industry  the banking industry. You know  this is a low point in the respect for business. Business is not seen as the solution. It's seen as the problem now  for most people. And rightly so  in many cases. There's a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing  that actually have made the problem worse. So this perspective is perhaps justified. How have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems  these many issues that we face in society  Well  we've tended to see the solutions in terms of NGOs  in terms of government  in terms of philanthropy. Indeed  the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs and social organizations. This is a unique  new organizational form that we've seen grown up. Enormous innovation  enormous energy  enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges. And many of us here are deeply involved in that. I'm a business school professor  but I've actually founded  I think  now  four nonprofits. Whenever I got interested and became aware of a societal problem  that was what I did  form a nonprofit. That was the way we've thought about how to deal with these issues. Even a business school professor has thought about it that way. But I think at this moment  we've been at this for quite a while. We've been aware of these problems for decades. We have decades of experience with our NGOs and with our government entities  and there's an awkward reality. The awkward reality is we're not making fast enough progress. We're not winning. These problems still seem very daunting and very intractable  and any solutions we're achieving are small solutions. We're making incremental progress. What's the fundamental problem we have in dealing with these social problems  If we cut all the complexity away  we have the problem of scale. We can't scale. We can make progress. We can show benefits. We can show results. We can make things better. We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good. We can't scale. We can't make a large scale impact on these problems. Why is that  Because we don't have the resources. And that's really clear now. And that's clearer now than it's been for decades. There's simply not enough money to deal with any of these problems at scale using the current model. There's not enough tax revenue  there's not enough philanthropic donations  to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now. We've got to confront that reality. And the scarcity of resources for dealing with these problems is only growing  certainly in the advanced world today  with all the fiscal problems we face. So if it's fundamentally a resource problem  where are the resources in society  How are those resources really created  the resources we're going to need to deal with all these societal challenges  Well there  I think the answer is very clear  They're in business. All wealth is actually created by business. Business creates wealth when it meets needs at a profit. That's how all wealth is created. It's meeting needs at a profit that leads to taxes and that leads to incomes and that leads to charitable donations. That's where all the resources come from. Only business can actually create resources. Other institutions can utilize them to do important work  but only business can create them. And business creates them when it's able to meet a need at a profit. The resources are overwhelmingly generated by business. The question then is  how do we tap into this  How do we tap into this  Business generates those resources when it makes a profit. That profit is that small difference between the price and the cost it takes to produce whatever solution business has created to whatever problem they're trying to solve. But that profit is the magic. Why  Because that profit allows whatever solution we've created to be infinitely scalable. Because if we can make a profit  we can do it for          a million      million  a billion. The solution becomes self sustaining. That's what business does when it makes a profit. Now what does this all have to do with social problems  Well  one line of thinking is  let's take this profit and redeploy it into social problems. Business should give more. Business should be more responsible. And that's been the path that we've been on in business. But again  this path that we've been on is not getting us where we need to go. Now  I started out as a strategy professor  and I'm still a strategy professor. I'm proud of that. But I've also  over the years  worked more and more on social issues. I've worked on healthcare  the environment  economic development  reducing poverty  and as I worked more and more in the social field  I started seeing something that had a profound impact on me and my whole life  in a way. The conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually  there's a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance. The conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit by causing a social problem. The classic example is pollution. If business pollutes  it makes more money than if it tried to reduce that pollution. Reducing pollution is expensive  therefore businesses don't want to do it. It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment. It's too expensive to have a safe working environment  therefore business makes more money if they don't have a safe working environment. That's been the conventional wisdom. A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom. They resisted environmental improvement. They resisted workplace improvement. That thinking has led to  I think  much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business  that I come to criticize in business. But the more deeply I got into all these social issues  one after another  and actually  the more I tried to address them myself  personally  in a few cases  through nonprofits that I was involved with  the more I found actually that the reality is the opposite. Business does not profit from causing social problems  actually not in any fundamental sense. That's a very simplistic view. The deeper we get into these issues  the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems. That's where the real profit comes. Let's take pollution. We've learned today that actually reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit. It saves money. It makes the business more productive and efficient. It doesn't waste resources. Having a safer working environment actually  and avoiding accidents  it makes the business more profitable  because it's a sign of good processes. Accidents are expensive and costly. Issue by issue by issue  we start to learn that actually there's no trade off between social progress and economic efficiency in any fundamental sense. Another issue is health. I mean  what we've found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure  because that health allows those employees to be more productive and come to work and not be absent. The deeper work  the new work  the new thinking on the interface between business and social problems is actually showing that there's a fundamental  deep synergy  particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run. In the very short run  you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there's fundamentally opposing goals  but in the long run  ultimately  we're learning in field after field that this is simply not true. So how could we tap into the power of business to address the fundamental problems that we face  Imagine if we could do that  because if we could do it  we could scale. We could tap into this enormous resource pool and this organizational capacity. And guess what  That's happening now  finally  partly because of people like you who have raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade. We see organizations like Dow Chemical leading the revolution away from trans fat and saturated fat with innovative new products. This is an example of Jain Irrigation. This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology to thousands and millions of farmers  reducing substantially the use of water. We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria that's figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees. You see companies like Cisco that are training so far four million people in I.T. skills to actually  yes  be responsible  but help expand the opportunity to disseminate I.T. technology and grow the whole business. There's a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems  and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business. And the question is  how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value  This is what I call shared value  addressing a social issue with a business model. That's shared value. Shared value is capitalism  but it's a higher kind of capitalism. It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be  meeting important needs  not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share. Shared value is when we can create social value and economic value simultaneously. It's finding those opportunities that will unleash the greatest possibility we have to actually address these social problems because we can scale. We can address shared value at multiple levels. It's real. It's happening. But in order to get this solution working  we have to now change how business sees itself  and this is thankfully underway. Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom that they shouldn't worry about social problems  that this was sort of something on the side  that somebody else was doing it. We're now seeing companies embrace this idea. But we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have NGOs and government working in partnership with business. The new NGOs that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships  that have found these ways to collaborate. The governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots. And government has many ways in which it could impact the willingness and the ability of companies to compete in this way. I think if we can get business seeing itself differently  and if we can get others seeing business differently  we can change the world. I know it. I'm seeing it. I'm feeling it. Young people  I think  my Harvard Business School students  are getting it. If we can break down this sort of divide  this unease  this tension  this sense that we're not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems  we can break this down  and we finally  I think  can have solutions. Thank you. Here's a question we need to rethink together  What should be the role of money and markets in our societies  Today  there are very few things that money can't buy. If you're sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara  California  you should know that if you don't like the standard accommodations  you can buy a prison cell upgrade. It's true. For how much  do you think  What would you guess  Five hundred dollars  It's not the Ritz Carlton. It's a jail  Eighty two dollars a night. Eighty two dollars a night. If you go to an amusement park and don't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides  there is now a solution. In many theme parks  you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line. They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets. And this isn't only happening in amusement parks. In Washington  D.C.  long lines  queues sometimes form for important Congressional hearings. Now some people don't like to wait in long queues  maybe overnight  even in the rain. So now  for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don't like to wait  there are companies  line standing companies  and you can go to them. You can pay them a certain amount of money  they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes  and the lobbyist  just before the hearing begins  can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room. Paid line standing. It's happening  the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions  in bigger arenas. Take the way we fight our wars. Did you know that  in Iraq and Afghanistan  there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were U.S. military troops  Now this isn't because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies  but this is what has happened. Over the past three decades  we have lived through a quiet revolution. We've drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies. The difference is this  A market economy is a tool  a valuable and effective tool  for organizing productive activity  but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale. It's a way of life  in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life  personal relations  family life  health  education  politics  law  civic life. Now  why worry  Why worry about our becoming market societies  For two reasons  I think. One of them has to do with inequality. The more things money can buy  the more affluence  or the lack of it  matters. If the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs  then inequality wouldn't matter very much. But when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life    decent health care  access to the best education  political voice and influence in campaigns    when money comes to govern all of those things  inequality matters a great deal. And so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence. That's one reason to worry. There's a second reason apart from the worry about inequality  and it's this  with some social goods and practices  when market thinking and market values enter  they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about. I'd like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism  a cash incentive  and see what you think about it. Many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids  especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds  to study hard  to do well in school  to apply themselves. Some economists have proposed a market solution  Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books. They've tried this  actually. They've done some experiments in some major American cities. In New York  in Chicago  in Washington  D.C.  they've tried this  offering    dollars for an A     dollars for a B. In Dallas  Texas  they have a program that offers eight year olds two dollars for each book they read. So let's see what    Some people are in favor  some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement. Let's see what people here think about it. Imagine that you are the head of a major school system  and someone comes to you with this proposal. And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds. You don't have to take it out of your budget. How many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try  Let's see by a show of hands. First  how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work  Raise your hand. And how many would be opposed  How many would    So the majority here are opposed  but a sizable minority are in favor. Let's have a discussion. Let's start with those of you who object  who would rule it out even before trying. What would be your reason  Who will get our discussion started  Yes  Heike Moses  Hello everyone  I'm Heike  and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation  so in the respect that children  if they would like to read  you just take this incentive away in just paying them  so it just changes behavior. Michael Sandel  Takes the intrinsic incentive away. What is  or should be  the intrinsic motivation  HM  Well  the intrinsic motivation should be to learn. MS  To learn. HM  To get to know the world. And then  if you stop paying them  what happens then  Then they stop reading  MS  Now  let's see if there's someone who favors  who thinks it's worth trying this. Elizabeth Loftus  I'm Elizabeth Loftus  and you said worth a try  so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things  MS  And measure. And what would you measure  You'd measure how many    EL  How many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them. MS  Oh  after you stopped paying. All right  what about that  HM  To be frank  I just think this is  not to offend anyone  a very American way. MS  All right. What's emerged from this discussion is the following question  Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation  the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey  which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes  And people disagree about what the effect will be  but that seems to be the question  that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson  and if it does  what will become of these children later  I should tell you what's happened with these experiments. The cash for good grades has had very mixed results  for the most part has not resulted in higher grades. The two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books. It also led them to read shorter books. But the real question is  what will become of these kids later  Will they have learned that reading is a chore  a form of piecework to be done for pay  that's the worry  or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake  Now  what this  even this brief debate  brings out is something that many economists overlook. Economists often assume that markets are inert  that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange. Market exchange  they assume  doesn't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged. This may be true enough if we're talking about material goods. If you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift  it will be the same good. It will work the same either way. But the same may not be true if we're talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life. In those domains  bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring about. Once we see that markets and commerce  when extended beyond the material domain  can change the character of the goods themselves  can change the meaning of the social practices  as in the example of teaching and learning  we have to ask where markets belong and where they don't  where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about. But to have this debate  we have to do something we're not very good at  and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practices we prize  from our bodies to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning to civic life. Now these are controversial questions  and so we tend to shrink from them. In fact  during the past three decades  when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige  our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out  empty of larger moral meaning. For fear of disagreement  we shrink from these questions. But once we see that markets change the character of goods  we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods. One of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything is on commonality  the sense that we are all in it together. Against the background of rising inequality  marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives. We live and work and shop and play in different places. Our children go to different schools. This isn't good for democracy  nor is it a satisfying way to live  even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line. Here's why. Democracy does not require perfect equality  but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life. What matters is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life encounter one another  bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life  because this is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences. And this is how we come to care for the common good. And so  in the end  the question of markets is not mainly an economic question. It's really a question of how we want to live together. Do we want a society where everything is up for sale  or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy  Thank you very much. The work of a transportation commissioner isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals. It involves the design of cities and the design of city streets. Streets are some of the most valuable resources that a city has  and yet it's an asset that's largely hidden in plain sight. And the lesson from New York over the past six years is that you can update this asset. You can remake your streets quickly  inexpensively  it can provide immediate benefits  and it can be quite popular. You just need to look at them a little differently. This is important because we live in an urban age. For the first time in history  most people live in cities  and the U.N. estimates that over the next    years  the population is going to double on the planet. So the design of cities is a key issue for our future. Mayor Bloomberg recognized this when he launched PlaNYC in     . The plan recognized that cities are in a global marketplace  and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here  we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure. For many cities  our streets have been in a kind of suspended animation for generations. This is a picture of Times Square in the '  s  and despite all of the technological innovation  cultural changes  political changes  this is Times Square in     . Not much has changed in those    years. So we worked hard to refocus our agenda  to maximize efficient mobility  providing more room for buses  more room for bikes  more room for people to enjoy the city  and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them. We set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks. Having goals is important  because if you want to change and steer the ship of a big city in a new direction  you need to know where you're going and why. The design of a street can tell you everything about what's expected on it. In this case  it's expected that you shelter in place. The design of this street is really to maximize the movement of cars moving as quickly as possible from point A to point B  and it misses all the other ways that a street is used. When we started out  we did some early surveys about how our streets were used  and we found that New York City was largely a city without seats. Pictures like this  people perched on a fire hydrant  not the mark of a world class city. It's not great for parents with kids. It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers. It's probably not good for the fire hydrants. Certainly not good for the police department. So we worked hard to change that balance  and probably the best example of our new approach is in Times Square. Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through Times Square  and people had tried for years to make changes. They changed signals  they changed lanes  everything they could do to make Times Square work better. It was dangerous  hard to cross the street. It was chaotic. And so  none of those approaches worked  so we took a different approach  a bigger approach  looked at our street differently. And so we did a six month pilot. We closed Broadway from   nd Street to   th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space. And the temporary materials are an important part of the program  because we were able to show how it worked. And I work for a data driven mayor  as you probably know. So it was all about the data. So if it worked better for traffic  if it was better for mobility  if it was safer  better for business  we would keep it  and if it didn't work  no harm  no foul  we could put it back the way that it was  because these were temporary materials. And that was a very big part of the buy in  much less anxiety when you think that something can be put back. But the results were overwhelming. Traffic moved better. It was much safer. Five new flagship stores opened. It's been a total home run. Times Square is now one of the top    retail locations on the planet. And this is an important lesson  because it doesn't need to be a zero sum game between moving traffic and creating public space. Every project has its surprises  and one of the big surprises with Times Square was how quickly people flocked to the space. We put out the orange barrels  and people just materialized immediately into the street. It was like a Star Trek episode  you know  They weren't there before  and then zzzzzt  All the people arrived. Where they'd been  I don't know  but they were there. And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us  because the street furniture had not yet arrived. So we went to a hardware store and bought hundreds of lawn chairs  and we put those lawn chairs out on the street. And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town. It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars. It was about those lawn chairs.  What did you think about the lawn chairs    Do you like the color of the lawn chairs   So if you've got a big  controversial project  think about lawn chairs. This is the final design for Times Square  and it will create a level surface  sidewalk to sidewalk  beautiful pavers that have studs in them to reflect the light from the billboards  creating a great new energy on the street  and we think it's going to really create a great place  a new crossroads of the world that is worthy of its name. And we will be cutting the ribbon on this  the first phase  this December. With all of our projects  our public space projects  we work closely with local businesses and local merchant groups who maintain the spaces  move the furniture  take care of the plants. This is in front of Macy's  and they were a big supporter of this new approach  because they understood that more people on foot is better for business. And we've done these projects all across the city in all kinds of neighborhoods. This is in Bed Stuy  Brooklyn  and you can see the short leg that was there  used for cars  that's not really needed. So what we did is we painted over the street  put down epoxy gravel  and connected the triangle to the storefronts on Grand Avenue  created a great new public space  and it's been great for businesses along Grand Avenue. We did the same thing in DUMBO  in Brooklyn  and this is one of our first projects that we did  and we took an underutilized  pretty dingy looking parking lot and used some paint and planters to transform it over a weekend. And in the three years since we've implemented the project  retail sales have increased     percent. And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood. We've moved very  very quickly with paint and temporary materials. Instead of waiting through years of planning studies and computer models to get something done  we've done it with paint and temporary materials. And the proof is not in a computer model. It is in the real world performance of the street. You can have fun with paint. All told  we've created over    pedestrian plazas in all five boroughs across the city. We've repurposed    acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space. I think one of the successes is in its emulation. You're seeing this kind of approach  since we've painted Times Square  you've seen this approach in Boston  in Chicago  in San Francisco  in Mexico City  Buenos Aires  you name it. This is actually in Los Angeles  and they actually copied even the green dots that we had on the streets. But I can't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods. We also brought this quick acting approach to our cycling program  and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in New York. I think it's fair to say    it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike  and now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States. And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of lanes. You can see the map in     . This is how it looked in      after we built out     miles of on street bike lanes. I love this because it looks so easy. You just click it  and they're there. We also brought new designs to the street. We created the first parking protected bike lane in the United States. We protected bikers by floating parking lanes  and it's been great. Bike volumes have spiked. Injuries to all users  pedestrians  cyclists  drivers  are all down    percent. And we've built    miles of these protected bike lanes  and now you're seeing them pop up all over the country. And you can see here that this strategy has worked. The blue line is the number of cyclists  soaring. The green line is the number of bike lanes. And the yellow line is the number of injuries  which has remained essentially flat. After this big expansion  you've seen no net increase in injuries  and so there is something to that axiom that there is safety in numbers. Not everybody liked the new bike lanes  and there was a lawsuit and somewhat of a media frenzy a couple years ago. One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on Prospect Park West  the most contested piece of land outside of the Gaza Strip.  And this is what we had done. So if you dig below the headlines  though  you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press  far ahead of the politicians. In fact  I think most politicians would be happy to have those kind of poll numbers. Sixty four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes. This summer  we launched Citi Bike  the largest bike share program in the United States  with       bikes and     stations located next to one another. Since we've launched the program  three million trips have been taken. People have ridden seven million miles. That's     times around the globe. And so with this little blue key  you can unlock the keys to the city and this brand new transportation option. And daily usage just continues to soar. What has happened is the average daily ridership on the streets of New York is        people. The high that we've had so far is        in August. Yesterday         people used Citi Bike in New York City. The bikes are being used six times a day. And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets. In the past  it looked like the guy on the left  ninja clad bike messenger. And today  cyclists look like New York City looks. It's diverse    young  old  black  white  women  kids  all getting on a bike. It's an affordable  safe  convenient way to get around. Quite radical. We've also brought this approach to our buses  and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America  the slowest bus speeds. As everybody knows  you can walk across town faster than you can take the bus. And so we focused on the most congested areas of New York City  built out six bus rapid transit lines     miles of new speedy bus lanes. You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus. We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane  and it's been a huge success. I think one of my very favorite moments as transportation commissioner was the day that we launched Citi Bike  and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue in my protected bike lane  and I looked over and I saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands  and the traffic was flowing  birds were singing    the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes. It was just fantastic. And this is how it looked six years ago. And so  I think that the lesson that we have from New York is that it's possible to change your streets quickly  it's not expensive  it can provide immediate benefits  and it can be quite popular. You just need to reimagine your streets. They're hidden in plain sight. Thank you.  Iran is Israel's best friend  and we do not intend to change our position in relation to Tehran.  Believe it or not  this is a quote from an Israeli prime minister  but it's not Ben Gurion or Golda Meir from the era of the Shah. It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin. The year is     . Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive  and much like Ahmadinejad today  he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel. Yet  Rabin referred to Iran as a geostrategic friend. Today  when we hear the threats of war and the high rhetoric  we're oftentimes led to believe that this is yet another one of those unsolvable Middle Eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself. Nothing could be further from the truth  and I hope today to show you why that is. The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive  starting in     B.C.  when King Cyrus the Great of Persia liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity. A third of the Jewish population stayed in Babylonia. They're today's Iraqi Jews. A third migrated to Persia. They're today's Iranian Jews  still        of them living in Iran  making them the largest Jewish community in the Middle East outside of Israel itself. And a third returned to historic Palestine  did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem  financed  incidentally  by Persian tax money. But even in modern times  relations have been close at times. Rabin's statement was a reflection of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two  which in turn was born out of perception of common threats. Both states feared the Soviet Union and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq. And  in addition  the Israeli doctrine of the periphery  the idea that Israel's security was best achieved by creating alliances with the non Arab states in the periphery of the region in order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity. Now  from the Shah's perspective  though  he wanted to keep this as secret as possible  so when Yitzhak Rabin  for instance  traveled to Iran in the '  s  he usually wore a wig so that no one would recognize him. The Iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in Tehran  far away from the central terminal  so that no one would notice the large number of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran. Now  did all of this end with the Islamic revolution in       In spite of the very clear anti Israeli ideology of the new regime  the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on  because they still had common threats. And when Iraq invaded Iran in       Israel feared an Iraqi victory and actively helped Iran by selling it arms and providing it with spare parts for Iran's American weaponry at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable because of an American arms embargo that Israel was more than happy to violate. In fact  back in the     s  it was Israel that lobbied Washington to talk to Iran  to sell arms to Iran  and not pay attention to Iran's anti Israeli ideology. And this  of course  climaxed in the Iran Contra scandal of the     s. But with the end of the Cold War came also the end of the Israeli Iranian cold peace. Suddenly  the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades  more or less evaporated. The Soviet Union collapsed  Iraq was defeated  and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure  but they were also now left unchecked. Without Iraq balancing Iran  Iran could now become a threat  some in Israel argued. In fact  the current dynamic that you see between Iran and Israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the Cold War than in the events of       because at this point  Iran and Israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region  and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners  they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors. So Israel  who in the     s lobbied for and improved U.S. Iran relations now feared a U.S. Iran rapprochement  thinking that it would come at Israel's security interests' expense  and instead sought to put Iran in increased isolation. Ironically  this was happening at a time when Iran was more interested in peacemaking with Washington than to see to Israel's destruction. Iran had put itself in isolation because of its radicalism  and after having helped the United States indirectly in the war against Iraq in       the Iranians were hoping that they would be rewarded by being included in the post war security architecture of the region. But Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach  as it would a decade later in Afghanistan  and instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation  and it is at this point  around       '    that Iran begins to translate its anti Israeli ideology into operational policy. The Iranians believed that whatever they did  even if they moderated their policies  the U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation  and the only way Iran could compel Washington to change its position was by imposing a cost on the U.S. if it didn't. The easiest target was the peace process  and now the Iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite  and Iran began supporting extensively Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously had shunned. In some ways  this sounds paradoxical  but according to Martin Indyk of the Clinton administration  the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong  because the more peace there would be between Israel and Palestine  the U.S. believed  the more Iran would get isolated. The more Iran got isolated  the more peace there would be. So according to Indyk  and these are his words  the Iranians had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to defeat our policy of containment. To defeat our policy of containment  not about ideology. But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement  all sides have reached out to each other. Netanyahu  when he got elected in       reached out to the Iranians to see if there were any ways that the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected. Tehran was not interested. A few years later  the Iranians sent a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration  a proposal that revealed that there was some potential of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again. The Bush administration did not even respond. All sides have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. But this is not an ancient conflict. This is not even an ideological conflict. The ebbs and flows of hostility have not shifted with ideological zeal  but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape. When Iran and Israel's security imperatives dictated collaboration  they did so in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other. When Iran's ideological impulses collided with its strategic interests  the strategic interests always prevailed. This is good news  because it means that neither war nor enmity is a foregone conclusion. But some want war. Some believe or say that it's       Iran is Germany  and Ahmadinejad is Hitler. If we accept this to be true  that indeed it is       Iran is Germany  Ahmadinejad is Hitler  then the question we have to ask ourself is  who wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain  Who will risk peace  This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at eliminating diplomacy  and when you eliminate diplomacy  you make war inevitable. In an ideological conflict  there can be no truce  no draw  no compromise  only victory or defeat. But rather than making war inevitable by viewing this as ideological  we would be wise to seek ways to make peace possible. Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon  only a few decades old in a history of       years  and precisely because its roots are geopolitical  it means that solutions can be found  compromises can be struck  however difficult it yet may be. After all  it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said   You don't make peace with your friends. You make it with your enemies.  Thank you. I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases  and following my training  I moved to Somalia from San Francisco. And my goodbye greeting from the chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General was   Gary  this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make.  But I landed in a refugee situation that had a million refugees in    camps  and there were six of us doctors. There were many epidemics there. My responsibilities were largely related to tuberculosis  and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera. So it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that I was responsible for inhibiting. And in order to do this work  we  of course  because of the limitation in health workers  had to recruit refugees to be a specialized new category of health worker. Following three years of work in Somalia  I got picked up by the World Health Organization  and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS. My primary responsibility was Uganda  but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi and Zaire  now Congo  Tanzania  Malawi  and several other countries. And my last assignment there was to run a unit called intervention development  which was responsible for designing interventions. After    years of working overseas  I was exhausted. I really had very little left. I had been traveling to one country after another. I was emotionally feeling very isolated. I wanted to come home. I'd seen a lot of death  in particular epidemic death  and epidemic death has a different feel to it. It's full of panic and fear  and I'd heard the women wailing and crying in the desert. And I wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over. I was not aware of any epidemic problems in America. In fact  I wasn't aware of any problems in America. In fact    seriously. And in fact I would visit friends of mine  and I noticed that they had water that came right into their homes. How many of you have such a situation  And some of them  many of them actually  had water that came into more than one room. And I noticed that they would move this little thermoregulatory device to change the temperature in their home by one degree or two degrees. And now I do that. And I really didn't know what I would do  but friends of mine began telling me about children shooting other children with guns. And I asked the question  what are you doing about it  What are you in America doing about it  And there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent. And one was punishment. And this I had heard about before. We who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued. It was not a main driver of behavior  nor was it a main driver of behavior change. And besides that  it reminded me of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science hadn't been there before  epidemics of plague or typhus or leprosy  where the prevalent ideas were that there were bad people or bad humors or bad air  and widows were dragged around the moat  and dungeons were part of the solution. The other explanation or  in a way  the solution suggested  is please fix all of these things  the schools  the community  the homes  the families  everything. And I'd heard this before as well. I'd called this the  everything  theory  or EOE  Everything On Earth. But we'd also realized in treating other processes and problems that sometimes you don't need to treat everything. And so the sense that I had was there was a giant gap here. The problem of violence was stuck  and this has historically been the case in many other issues. Diarrheal diseases had been stuck. Malaria had been stuck. Frequently  a strategy has to be rethought. It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like  but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education. But I began to ask questions and search out the usual things that I had been exploring before  like  what do the maps look like  What do the graphs look like  What does the data look like  And the maps of violence in most U.S. cities looked like this. There was clustering. This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also in infectious epidemics  for example cholera. And then we looked at the maps  and the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave  because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics. And it also looked like infectious epidemics. And then we asked the question  well what really predicts a case of violence  And it turns out that the greatest predictor of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence. Which also sounds like  if there is a case of flu  someone gave someone a case of flu  or a cold  or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis is having been exposed to tuberculosis. And so we see that violence is  in a way  behaving like a contagious disease. We're aware of this anyway even in our common experiences or our newspaper stories of the spread of violence from fights or in gang wars or in civil wars or even in genocides. And so there's good news about this  though  because there's a way to reverse epidemics  and there's really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics  and the first of it is interrupting transmission. In order to interrupt transmission  you need to detect and find first cases. In other words  for T.B. you have to find somebody who has active T.B. who is infecting other people. Make sense  And there's special workers for doing that. For this particular problem  we designed a new category of worker who  like a SARS worker or someone looking for bird flu  might find first cases. In this case  it's someone who's very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend or owes him money  and you can find workers and train them into these specialized categories. And the second thing to do  of course  is to prevent further spread  that means to find who else has been exposed  but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of T.B.  or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods  but in the same group  and then they need to be  in a way  managed as well  particular to the specific disease process. And then the third part  the shifting the norms  and that means a whole bunch of community activities  remodeling  public education  and then you've got what you might call group immunity. And that combination of factors is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was very successfully reversed. And so what we decided to do in the year      is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers  the first being violence interruptors. And then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the United States at the time. So violence interruptors hired from the same group  credibility  trust  access  just like the health workers in Somalia  but designed for a different category  and trained in persuasion  cooling people down  buying time  reframing. And then another category of worker  the outreach workers  to keep people in a way on therapy for six to    months. Just like T.B.  but the object is behavior change. And then a bunch of community activities for changing norms. Now our first experiment of this resulted in a    percent drop in shootings and killings in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago. And this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself  first    or    days  then    days  and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another    days  and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon. They were using parks they weren't using before. The sun was out. Everybody was happy. But of course  the funders said   Wait a second  do it again.  And so we had to then  fortunately  get the funds to repeat this experience  and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a    percent drop in shootings and killings. And since that time  this has been replicated    times. There have been independent evaluations supported by the Justice Department and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins that have shown    to    percent and    to    percent reductions in shootings and killings using this new method. In fact  there have been three independent evaluations of this now. Now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this  including being featured on The New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story. The Economist in      said this is  the approach that will come to prominence.  And even a movie was made around our work.  The Interrupters  However  not so fast  because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it. We got a lot of criticism  a lot of opposition  and a lot of opponents. In other words  what do you mean  health problem  What do you mean  epidemic  What do you mean  no bad guys  And there's whole industries designed for managing bad people. What do you mean  hiring people who have backgrounds  My business friends said   Gary  you're being criticized tremendously. You must be doing something right.  My musician friends added the word  dude.  So anyway  additionally  there was still this problem  and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems. Yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful economies without healing the economy. So what's actually happened is  although there is still some opposition  the movement is clearly growing. Many of the major cities in the U.S.  including New York City and Baltimore and Kansas City  their health departments are running this now. Chicago and New Orleans  the health departments are having a very large role in this. This is being embraced more by law enforcement than it had been years ago. Trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up. And the U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed not only the approach but the specific model. Where there's really been uptake even faster is in the international environment  where there's a    percent drop in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico  where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras  where the strategy has been applied in Kenya for the recent elections  and where there have been     interruptions in Iraq. So violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease. So the theory  in a way  is kind of being validated by the treatment. And recently  the Institute of Medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data  including the neuroscience  on how this problem is really transmitted. So I think this is good news  because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the Middle Ages  which is where I feel this field has been. It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with playgrounds or parks  and to consider the possibility of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods  and to allow there to be a new strategy  a new set of methods  a new set of workers  science  in a way  replacing morality. And moving away from emotions is the most important part of the solution to science as a more important part of the solution. So I didn't mean to come up with this at all. It was a matter of  I wanted actually a break  and we looked at maps  we looked at graphs  we asked some questions and tried some tools that actually have been used many times before for other things. For myself  I tried to get away from infectious diseases  and I didn't. Thank you. So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online  experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools. And in my job at Twitter  I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well  helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with. And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction. But I want to start and go back to the     s. Long before a little thing called Twitter  radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast. And from those single points emanated stories. Some of them were familiar stories. Some of them were new stories. And for a while they were familiar formats  but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium. Think about episodes that happened live on radio. Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction  you get this new format. And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories. And of course  today  we have an entirely new medium to play with  which is this online world. This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them. There are thousands upon thousands of them. Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster. We've gone to this world of many to many  where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting. And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium. I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation  if you will  that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it  and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create. I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods. The short story  for example  people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e readers  digital marketplaces. One writer  Hugh Howey  experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called  Wool.  And he actually says that he didn't intend for  Wool  to become a series  but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more  and so he gave them more. He gave them  Wool     which was a little bit longer than the first one   Wool     which was even longer  culminating in  Wool     which was a        word novel. I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e books. He was able to write and publish in relatively short order. There was no mediator between him and the audience. It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him. So this whole project was an experiment. It started with the one short story  and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format. And that's something that this medium enabled  was experimentation being a part of the format itself. This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called  Black Box.  It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind. Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created. Now Twitter  of course  has a     character limit. Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook  used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet  and those tweets ended up becoming over     of them that were serialized by The New Yorker. Every night  at   p.m.  you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account. I think that's pretty exciting  tune in literary fiction. The experience of Egan's story  of course  like anything on Twitter  there were multiple ways to experience it. You could scroll back through it  but interestingly  if you were watching it live  there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets  you had no control over when you would read them. They were coming at a pretty regular clip  but as the story was building  normally  as a reader  you control how fast you move through a text  but in this case  The New Yorker did  and they were sending you bit by bit by bit  and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line. Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter  Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called  Evidence.  It began with this tweet   On November    at       p.m.  a woman identified as Miranda Brown      of Brooklyn  fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel.  It begins in Elliott's voice  but then Elliott's voice recedes  and we hear the voices of Elsa  Margot and Simon  characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story  a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at       p.m. when this woman falls to her death. These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives. One reviewer called Elliott's story  Twitter fiction done right   because she did. She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time. Interestingly  though  it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism. It was also Twitter as a production mechanism. Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs. She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line  line by line. I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves  but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter. As you begin to play with flexible identity online  it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world. Things like Invisible Obama or the famous  binders full of women  that came up during the      election cycle  or even the fan fiction universe of  West Wing  Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in  The West Wing   including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode.  Laughter  All of these are rapid iterations on a theme. They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium. You look at something like  West Wing  Twitter  in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world. They comment on politics  they cry out against the evils of Congress. Keep in mind  they're all Democrats. And they engage with the real world. They respond to it. So once you take flexible identity  anonymity  engagement with the real world  and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story  that's when things get really interesting. So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account. It was Mayor Emanuel. It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel  particularly in the expletive department. This foul mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race  providing commentary as it went. It followed all of the natural tropes of a good  solid Twitter parody account  but then started to get weird. And as it progressed  it moved from this commentary to a multi week  real time science fiction epic in which your protagonist  Rahm Emanuel  engages in multi dimensional travel on election day  which is    it didn't actually happen. I double checked the newspapers. And then  very interestingly  it came to an end. This is something that doesn't usually happen with a Twitter parody account. It ended  a true narrative conclusion. And so the author  Dan Sinker  who was a journalist  who was completely anonymous this whole time  I think Dan    it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book  because it was a narrative format in the end  and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats. One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now  actually  is the very absurdist Crimer Show. Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo  with all of the tropes of a television show. Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.  but  man  is it weird. And there are all these times where Crimer  the supercriminal  does all of these TV things. He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera  but these things just happen in text. I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode  spelled E P P A S O D   eppasod   presenting them as episodes really  it creates something new. There is a new  eppasod  of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day  and they're archived that way. And I think this is an interesting experiment in format. Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television. I think in nonfiction real time storytelling  there are a lot of really excellent examples as well. RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day    years ago in exceptional detail  as if you were reading the news reports from that day. And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news. In this particular case  he's talking about drone strikes. I think that in both of these examples  you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling. So with real time storytelling  blurring the lines between fact and fiction  the real world and the digital world  flexible identity  anonymity  these are all tools that we have accessible to us  and I think that they're just the building blocks. They are the bits that we use to create the structures  the frames  that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation. Thank you. So I'm a city planner  an urban designer  former arts advocate  trained in architecture and art history  and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient  how America can be healthier  and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. And I realize this is a global forum  but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history  in some places  not all  of American ideas being appropriated  being emulated  for better or for worse  around the world. And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. It's being emulated in many places as we speak. By suburban sprawl  I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use  and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas belching  time wasting and life threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to  most Americans  in fact  need  just to live their daily lives. And there's an alternative. You know  we say  half the world is living in cities. Well  in America  that living in cities  for many of them  they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. And what I work for  and to do  is to make our cities more walkable. But I can't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that I've learned from the economists  the epidemiologists and the environmentalists. So these are the three arguments that I'm going to give you quickly today. When I was growing up in the '  s  the typical American spent one tenth of their income  American family  on transportation. Since then  we've doubled the number of roads in America  and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation. Working families  which are defined as earning between        and        dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing  slightly more  because of this phenomenon called  drive till you qualify   finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs  so that they're locked in this  two  three hours  four hours a day of commuting. And these are the neighborhoods  for example  in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up  they were decimated. And in fact  these are many of the half vacant communities that you see today. Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage  it goes underwater  and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing. So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars. What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities  And probably the best example we have here in America is Portland  Oregon. Portland made a bunch of decisions in the     s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. While most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl  they instituted an urban growth boundary. While most cities were reaming out their roads  removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic  they instituted a skinny streets program. And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways  they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. And they spent    million dollars on bike facilities  which seems like a lot of money  but it was spent over about    years  so two million dollars a year    not that much    and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city. These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live  and their vehicle miles traveled per day  the amount that each person drives  actually peaked in       has been dropping ever since  and they now drive    percent less than the rest of the country. The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less  and    minutes less per day than they did before. The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those    minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region. So if they're not spending that money on driving    and by the way     percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy    if they're not spending that money on driving  what are they spending it on  Well  Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita  the most independent bookstores per capita  the most strip clubs per capita. These are all exaggerations  slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth  which is Portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of America. Actually  Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states  which may be a good thing or a bad thing  but it makes you glad they're driving less. But actually  they're spending most of it in their homes  and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get. But there's a whole other Portland story  which isn't part of this calculus  which is that young  educated people have been moving to Portland in droves  so that between the last two censuses  they had a    percent increase in college educated millennials  which is five times what you saw anywhere else in the country  or  I should say  of the national average. So on the one hand  a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable  but on the other hand  it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster  or an aerospace cluster  but to become a place where people want to be. And millennials  certainly  these engines of entrepreneurship     percent of whom decide first where they want to live  then they move there  then they look for a job  they will come to your city. The health argument is a scary one  and you've probably heard part of this argument before. Again  back in the '  s  a lot's changed since then  back in the '  s  one in    Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese  and a second third of the population is overweight. Twenty five percent of young men and    percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. According to the Center for Disease Control  fully one third of all children born after      will get diabetes. We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents. I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we've all heard about is an urban design crisis  and that the design of our cities lies at the cure. Because we've talked a long time about diet  and we know that diet impacts weight  and weight of course impacts health. But we've only started talking about inactivity  and how inactivity born of our landscape  inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk  is driving our weight up. And we finally have the studies  one in Britain called  Gluttony versus sloth  that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity  and found a much higher  stronger correlation between the latter two. Dr. James Levine at  in this case  the aptly named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear  held their diet steady  and then started pumping the calories in. Some people gained weight  some people didn't gain weight. Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work  they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving  and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting  on average  two hours more per day than those who didn't. So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity  but even more  we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. Do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city  or where in your city do you live  In San Diego  they used Walk Score    Walk Score rates every address in America and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is    they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods. Well guess what  If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. So we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health  particularly as in America  the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental induced inactivity. And I learned a new word last week. They call these neighborhoods  obesageneric.  I may have that wrong  but you get the idea. Now that's one thing  of course. Briefly mentioning  we have an asthma epidemic in this country. You probably haven't thought that much about it. Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma  three times what it was in the '  s  and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. American pollution does not come from factories anymore  it comes from tailpipes  and the amount that people are driving in your city  your urban VMT  is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city. And then finally  in terms of driving  there's the issue of the single largest killer of healthy adults  and one of the largest killers of all people  is car crashes. And we take car crashes for granted. We figure it's a natural risk of being on the road. But in fact  here in America     people out of every         die every year from car crashes. We're pretty safe here. Well  guess what  In England  it's seven per        . It's Japan  it's four per        . Do you know where it's three per          New York City. San Francisco  the same thing. Portland  the same thing. Oh  so cities make us safer because we're driving less  Tulsa     per        . Orlando     per        . It's not whether you're in the city or not  it's how is your city designed  Was it designed around cars or around people  Because if your city is designed around cars  it's really good at smashing them into each other. That's part of a much larger health argument. Finally  the environmental argument is fascinating  because the environmentalists turned on a dime about    years ago. The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti city movement from Jefferson on.  Cities are pestilential to the health  to the liberties  to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities  as they do in Europe  we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe and take to eating one another as they do there.  He apparently had a sense of humor. And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. To become more environmental  we move into the country  we commune with nature  we build suburbs. But  of course  we've seen what that does. The carbon mapping of America  where is the CO  being emitted  for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly. If you look at any carbon map  because we map it per square mile  any carbon map of the U.S.  it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.  hottest in the cities  cooler in the suburbs  dark  peaceful in the countryside. Until some economists said  you know  is that the right way to measure CO   There are only so many people in this country at any given time  and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact. And they said  let's measure CO  per household  and when they did that  the maps just flipped  coolest in the center city  warmer in the suburbs  and red hot in these exurban  drive till you qualify  neighborhoods. So a fundamental shift  and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species. If you love nature  the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it  move to a city  and the denser the better  and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best. So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '  s  consuming half of the electricity of Dallas. But of course  we can do better. Canadian cities  they consume half the gasoline of American cities. European cities consume half as much again. So obviously  we can do better  and we want to do better  and we're all trying to be green. My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way  and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets  on accessorizing    What can I add to my house  what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable     has kind of dominated the discussion. So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington  D.C.  and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system  solar hot water heater  dual flush toilets  bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high tech stove apparently  supposedly  contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations    That's what they said in the brochure. All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. We've changed all our light bulbs to energy savers  and you should do the same thing  but changing all your light bulbs to energy savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week. And we don't want to have this argument. Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a  lifestyle choice.  You don't want to tell Americans  God forbid  that they have to change their lifestyle. But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more  something that would be better than what we have right now  Well  the gold standard of quality of life rankings  it's called the Mercer Survey. You may have heard of it. They rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to    criteria that they believe add up to quality of life  health  economics  education  housing  you name it. There's six more. Short talk. And it's very interesting to see that the highest ranking American city  Honolulu  number     is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt  the Dallases and the Phoenixes and  sorry  Atlanta  these cities are not appearing on the list. But who's doing even better  The Canadian cities like Vancouver  where again  they're burning half the fuel. And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German  like Dusseldorf or Vienna  where they're burning  again  half as much fuel. And you see this alignment  this strange alignment. Is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life  I would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life  and that's living in a walkable neighborhood. So sustainability  which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. But particularly here in America  we are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway  then these two problems would seem to share the same solution  which is to make our cities more walkable. Doing so isn't easy  but it can be done  it has been done  and it's being done now in more than a few cities  around the globe and in our country. I take some solace from Winston Churchill  who put it this way   The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives.   Laughter  Thank you. So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China  the night I met my husband. It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking. So I went to a party. I sat down next to a stout  middle aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie  and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar  there in China specifically to study Sino Soviet relations. What a gift it was to the eager  young foreign correspondent that I was then. I'd pump him for information  I'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write. I talk to him for hours. Only months later  I discover who he really was. He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association.  I don't understand. Soybeans  You told me you were a Fulbright scholar.   Well  how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans   I said   You jerk.  Only jerk wasn't the word I used. I said   You could've gotten me fired.  And he said   Let's get married.   Travel the world and have lots of kids.  So we did. And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be. He was a Chinese scholar who later  in his   s  got a Ph.D. in Chinese history. He spoke six languages  he played    musical instruments  he was a licensed pilot  he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator  he was an expert in swine nutrition  dairy cattle  Dixieland jazz  film noir  and we did travel the country  and the world  and we did have a lot of kids. We followed my job  and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do. So when we found the cancer  it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other  we believed that  if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough  and we worked hard enough  we could keep him from dying ever. And for years  it seemed like we were succeeding. The surgeon emerged from the surgery. What'd he say  He said what surgeons always say   We got it all.  Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely. It turned out to be a rare  exceedingly aggressive type  with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most. And yet  he did not die. Mysteriously  he lived on. He coached Little League for our son. He built a playhouse for our daughter. And meanwhile  I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists. I'm looking for a cure. So a year goes by before the cancer  as cancers do  reappears  and with it comes another death sentence  this time nine months. So we try another treatment  aggressive  nasty. It makes him so sick  he has to quit it  yet still he lives on. Then another year goes by. Two years go by. More specialists. We take the kids to Italy. We take the kids to Australia. And then more years pass  and the cancer begins to grow. This time  there's new treatments on the horizon. They're exotic. They're experimental. They're going to attack the cancer in new ways. So he enters a clinical trial  and it works. The cancer begins to shrink  and for the third time  we've dodged death. So now I ask you  how do I feel when the time finally comes and there's another dark night  sometime between midnight and   a.m.  This time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I've never met before tells me that Terence is dying  perhaps tonight. So what do I say when he says   What do you want me to do   There's another drug out there. It's newer. It's more powerful. He started it just two weeks ago. Perhaps there's still hope ahead. So what do I say  I say   Keep him alive if you can.  And Terence died six days later. So we fought  we struggled  we triumphed. It was an exhilarating fight  and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation. We fought together  we lived together. It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious. It was also an expensive fight. It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end of life care  and of healthcare for all of us. And for me  for us  we pushed the fight right over the edge  and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day   Hey  buddy  it was a hell of a ride.  We never got the chance to say goodbye. We never thought it was the end. We always had hope. So what do we make of all of this  Being a journalist  after Terence died  I wrote a book   The Cost Of Hope.  I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did  why he did what he did  why everyone around us did what they did. And what did I discover  Well  one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper  the advance directive  to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices. Yet I had that piece of paper. We both did. And they were readily available. I had them right at hand. Both of them said the same thing  Do nothing if there is no further hope. I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own. Yet we never got to no further hope. Even with that clear cut paper in our hands  we just kept redefining hope. I believed I could keep him from dying  and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way. Right up until days before his death  I felt strongly and powerfully  and  you might say  irrationally  that I could keep him from dying ever. Now  what do the experts call this  They say it's denial. It's a strong word  isn't it  Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through. And I hear the medical professionals say   Well  we'd like to do such and such  but the family's in denial. The family won't listen to reason. They're in denial. How can they insist on this treatment at the end  It's so clear  yet they're in denial.  Now  I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking. It's not just families either. The medical professionals too  you out there  you're in denial too. You want to help. You want to fix. You want to do. You've succeeded in everything you've done  and having a patient die  well  that must feel like failure. I saw it firsthand. Just days before Terence died  his oncologist said   Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.  Days before he died. Yet Ira Byock  the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said   You know  the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal.  So what the experts call  denial   I call  hope   and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design. You just redefine denial and hope  and it becomes a feature of being human. It's not a bug. It's a feature. So we need to think more constructively about this very common  very profound and very powerful human emotion. It's part of the human condition  and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it. So Terence told me a story on that long ago night  and I believed it. Maybe I wanted to believe it. And during Terence's illness  I  we  we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too. Giving up the fight    for that's how it felt  it felt like giving up    meant giving up not only his life but also our story  our story of us as fighters  the story of us as invincible  and for the doctors  the story of themselves as healers. So what do we need  Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper. Maybe we need a new story  not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness  but rather a story of victory and triumph  of a valiant battle and  eventually  a graceful retreat  a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe  that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal  and that no wife  no matter how hard she tried  has ever stopped even the bravest  wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go. People did mention hospice  but I wouldn't listen. Hospice was for people who were dying  and Terence wasn't dying. As a result  he spent just four days in hospice  which I'm sure  as you all know  is a pretty typical outcome  and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end. We have a noble path to curing the disease  patients and doctors alike  but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying. Dying is seen as failing  and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together  but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go. So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end  and for saying goodbye  and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight  and a hero's goodbye. Terence loved poetry  and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets. So I'll give you a couple lines from him. This is a poem about Mark Antony. You know Mark Antony  the conquering hero  Cleopatra's guy  Actually  one of Cleopatra's guys. And he's been a pretty good general. He's won all the fights  he's eluded all the people that are out to get him  and yet this time  finally  he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost. The people are leaving. They're playing instruments. They're singing. And suddenly he knows he's been defeated. And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods  and it's time to let go. And the poet tells him what to do. He tells him how to say a noble goodbye  a goodbye that's fit for a hero.  As if long prepared  as if courageous  as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city  approach the window with a firm step  and with emotion  but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward  as a last enjoyment  listen to the sounds  the exquisite instruments of the musical troops  and bid her farewell  the Alexandria you are losing.  That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life  a goodbye for a man for whom anything  well  almost anything  was possible  a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive. And isn't that what we're missing  How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly  powerfully  many times irrationally  on the slimmest of hopes  The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial. It's part of our DNA as humans  and maybe it's time our healthcare system    doctors  patients  insurance companies  us  started accounting for the power of that hope. Hope isn't a bug. It's a feature. Thank you. Throughout my career  I've been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects  documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit. I think of new cities like Dubai or ancient cities like Rome with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum  or like right here in New York with the High Line  a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this. But what I find really fascinating is what happens when architects and planners leave and these places become appropriated by people  like here in Chandigarh  India  the city which has been completely designed by the architect Le Corbusier. Now    years later  the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for  like here  where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall. But over the course of several years  I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's CCTV building in Beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects Herzog and de Meuron. At these large scale construction sites in China  you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process. As the length of the construction takes years  workers end up forming a rather rough and ready informal city  making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they're building. Over the past seven years  I've been following my fascination with the built environment  and for those of you who know me  you would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase     days a year. Being constantly on the move means that sometimes I am able to catch life's most unpredictable moments  like here in New York the day after the Sandy storm hit the city. Just over three years ago  I was for the first time in Caracas  Venezuela  and while flying over the city  I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city  a place where nearly    percent of the population lives in slums  draped literally all over the mountains. During a conversation with local architects Urban Think Tank  I learned about the Torre David  a    story office building which sits right in the center of Caracas. The building was under construction until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early '  s. About eight years ago  people started moving into the abandoned tower and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower. There's only one little entrance to the entire building  and the       residents come in and out through that single door. Together  the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower. In the lobby  they painted the walls and planted trees. They also made a basketball court. But when you look up closely  you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through. Within the tower  people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower. With no elevators  the tower is like a    story walkup. Designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven't had any education in architecture or design. And with each inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by  this tower becomes like a living city  a place which is alive with micro economies and small businesses. The inventive inhabitants  for instance  find opportunities in the most unexpected cases  like the adjacent parking garage  which has been reclaimed as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to the apartments. A walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create walls  how to make an air flow  how to create transparency  circulation throughout the tower  essentially creating a home that's completely adapted to the conditions of the site. When a new inhabitant moves into the tower  they already have a roof over their head  so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets. Slowly  from found materials  walls rise  and people create a space out of any found objects or materials. It's remarkable to see the design decisions that they're making  like when everything is made out of red bricks  some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish. The inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands  and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower. They typically make the best out of their conditions  and try to make their spaces look nice and homey  or at least up until as far as they can reach. Throughout the tower  you come across all kinds of services  like the barber  small factories  and every floor has a little grocery store or shop. And you even find a church. And on the   th floor  there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed. From the outside  behind this always changing facade  you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic  intuitive way that responds directly to their needs. Let's go now to Africa  to Nigeria  to a community called Makoko  a slum where         people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place  when you see it from above  there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home. From the main dock  people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area. When out on the water  it's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living. Even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house  selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits. Behind every window and door frame  you'll see a small child peering back at you  and while Makoko seems to be packed with people  what's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building. The population growth in Nigeria  and especially in these areas like Makoko  are painful reminders of how out of control things really are. In Makoko  very few systems and infrastructures exist. Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self built wells throughout the area. This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water  so fishing and boat making are common professions. You'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area  like barbershops  CD and DVD stores  movie theaters  tailors  everything is there. There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place  like that hotel in Sweden. On this particular evening  I came across this live band dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits. They were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted out generator for all of the community to enjoy. By nightfall  the area becomes almost pitch black  save for a small lightbulb or a fire. What originally brought me to Makoko was this project from a friend of mine  Kunl  Adeyemi  who recently finished building this three story floating school for the kids in Makoko. With this entire village existing on the water  public space is very limited  so now that the school is finished  the ground floor is a playground for the kids  but when classes are out  the platform is just like a town square  where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats. Another place I'd like to share with you is the Zabbaleen in Cairo. They're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper Egypt in the '  s  and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over Cairo. For years  the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities  but in the early     s  they settled on the Mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city. Today  they live in this area  approximately        to        people  who live in this community of self built multi story houses where up to three generations live in one structure. While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid  each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space. I find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there  like this very distinguished man who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him  or like these two young men who are sitting and chatting amongst these tons of garbage. While to most of us  living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable  to those in the Zabbaleen  this is just a different type of normal. In all these places I've talked about today  what I do find fascinating is that there's really no such thing as normal  and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation. Throughout the day  it's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets  just like this engagement party. In this tradition  the bride to be displays all of their belongings  which they soon bring to their new husband. A gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed and all the garbage is used as props to display all their new home accessories. Like Makoko and the Torre David  throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood. There are the retail shops  the cafes and the restaurants  and the community is this community of Coptic Christians  so you'll also find a church  along with the scores of religious iconographies throughout the area  and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops  the barbers  everything. Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen is also full of surprises. While from the outside  these homes look like any other informal structure in the city  when you step inside  you are met with all manner of design decisions and interior decoration. Despite having limited access to space and money  the homes in the area are designed with care and detail. Every apartment is unique  and this individuality tells a story about each family's circumstances and values. Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously  putting a lot of work and care into the details. The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner  where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns. But despite this elaborate decor  sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways  like this home which caught my attention while all the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door. When I was let in  it appeared that this fifth floor apartment was being transformed into a complete animal farm  where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room. But then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area. The attention to this detail astonished me  and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment  from floor to ceiling  every part was decorated. But if it weren't for the strangely familiar stomach churning odor that constantly passes through the apartment  it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill. What moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions  I was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love  care  and unreserved passion. Let's move across the map to China  to an area called Shanxi  Henan and Gansu. In a region famous for the soft  porous Loess Plateau soil  there lived until recently an estimated    million people in these houses underground. These dwellings are called the yaodongs. Through this architecture by subtraction  these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil. In these villages  you see an entirely altered landscape  and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square  rectangular houses which sit seven meters below the ground. When I asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground  they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn't have the money to buy materials  and this digging out was their most logical form of living. From Makoko to Zabbaleen  these communities have approached the tasks of planning  design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances. Created by these very people who live  work and play in these particular spaces  these neighborhoods are intuitively designed to make the most of their circumstances. In most of these places  the government is completely absent  leaving inhabitants with no choice but to reappropriate found materials  and while these communities are highly disadvantaged  they do present examples of brilliant forms of ingenuity  and prove that indeed we have the ability to adapt to all manner of circumstances. What makes places like the Torre David particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into. Now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves  and how highly particular their solutions would be  if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into. Today  you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people. From China to Brazil  these projects attempt to provide as many houses as possible  but they're completely generic and simply do not work as an answer to the individual needs of the people. I would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration  Zita Cobb  the founder of the wonderful Shorefast Foundation  based out of Fogo Island  Newfoundland. She says that  there's this plague of sameness which is killing the human joy   and I couldn't agree with her more. Thank you. I would like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving Adam and Eve  and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past    years. You know the incident. Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Eden realize they are naked. They freak out. And the rest is history. Nowadays  Adam and Eve would probably act differently.   Adam Last nite was a blast  loved dat apple LOL    Eve yep.. babe  know what happened to my pants tho   We do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before  and so much information about us is being collected by organizations. Now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information  or big data  but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy. And my story is about these tradeoffs. We start with an observation which  in my mind  has become clearer and clearer in the past few years  that any personal information can become sensitive information. Back in the year       about     billion photos were shot worldwide  but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online. In       only on Facebook  in a single month   .  billion photos were uploaded  most of them identified. In the same span of time  computers' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude. What happens when you combine these technologies together  increasing availability of facial data  improving facial recognizing ability by computers  but also cloud computing  which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three letter agencies  and ubiquitous computing  which allows my phone  which is not a supercomputer  to connect to the Internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds  Well  we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity. To test that  we did an experiment on Carnegie Mellon University campus. We asked students who were walking by to participate in a study  and we took a shot with a webcam  and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop. While they were filling out the survey  we uploaded their shot to a cloud computing cluster  and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from Facebook profiles. By the time the subject reached the last page on the survey  the page had been dynamically updated with the    best matching photos which the recognizer had found  and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo. Do you see the subject  Well  the computer did  and in fact did so for one out of three subjects. So essentially  we can start from an anonymous face  offline or online  and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data. But a few years back  we did something else. We started from social media data  we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security  and we ended up predicting social security numbers  which in the United States are extremely sensitive information. Do you see where I'm going with this  So if you combine the two studies together  then the question becomes  can you start from a face and  using facial recognition  find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person  and from that publicly available information infer non publicly available information  much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face  And the answer is  yes  we can  and we did. Of course  the accuracy keeps getting worse.      of subjects' first   SSN digits identified  with   attempts   But in fact  we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time  looking for a match  finding public information  trying to infer sensitive information  and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject  an example of augmented reality  probably a creepy example of augmented reality. In fact  we didn't develop the app to make it available  just as a proof of concept. In fact  take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme. Imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or  one day  their contact lenses  and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you. What will this future without secrets look like  And should we care  We may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases  but in fact  having so much information doesn't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective. In another experiment  we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate. We included in this information some references to some funny  absolutely legal  but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online. Now interestingly  among our subjects  some had posted comparable information  and some had not. Which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly our subject  Paradoxically  it was the group who had posted similar information  an example of moral dissonance. Now you may be thinking  this does not apply to me  because I have nothing to hide. But in fact  privacy is not about having something negative to hide. Imagine that you are the H.R. director of a certain organization  and you receive r sum s  and you decide to find more information about the candidates. Therefore  you Google their names and in a certain universe  you find this information. Or in a parallel universe  you find this information. Do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview  If you think so  then you are not like the U.S. employers who are  in fact  part of our experiment  meaning we did exactly that. We created Facebook profiles  manipulating traits  then we started sending out r sum s to companies in the U.S.  and we detected  we monitored  whether they were searching for our candidates  and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media. And they were. Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates. Now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor. But think again. Why should that be always the case  In a movie which came out a few years ago   Minority Report   a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him. Now  that movie is set in       about    years from now  and as exciting as that technology looks  it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you  and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. So as an example  this is another experiment actually we are running  not yet completed. Imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends  and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most. And then they create  in real time  a facial composite of these two friends. Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites  but they react to those composites in a positive manner. So next time you are looking for a certain product  and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it  it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends  and you will not even know that this is happening. Now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight. One of these mechanisms is transparency  telling people what you are going to do with their data. And in principle  that's a very good thing. It's necessary  but it is not sufficient. Transparency can be misdirected. You can tell people what you are going to do  and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information. So in yet another experiment  this one with students  we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior  including pretty sensitive questions  such as this one.  Have you ever cheated in an exam   Now to one group of subjects  we told them   Only other students will see your answers.  To another group of subjects  we told them   Students and faculty will see your answers.  Transparency. Notification. And sure enough  this worked  in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second. It makes sense  right  But then we added the misdirection. We repeated the experiment with the same two groups  this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions. How long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect of knowing that faculty would see your answers  Ten minutes  Five minutes  One minute  How about    seconds  Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information  as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers. Now I have to admit that this talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy  but that is not my point. In fact  I want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives. The way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done  and certainly not the best way they can be done. When someone tells you   People don't care about privacy   consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy  and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself. When someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data  consider that in the last    years  researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy preserving manner. We can browse the Internet anonymously. We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient  not even the NSA. We can have even privacy preserving data mining. In other words  we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy. Of course  these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects  which is why  perhaps  you don't hear more about them. Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden. There is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the Garden of Eden which doesn't have to do with the issue of Adam and Eve feeling naked and feeling ashamed. You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton's  Paradise Lost.  In the garden  Adam and Eve are materially content. They're happy. They are satisfied. However  they also lack knowledge and self awareness. The moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge  that's when they discover themselves. They become aware. They achieve autonomy. The price to pay  however  is leaving the garden. So privacy  in a way  is both the means and the price to pay for freedom. Again  marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them  but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. We get free content. We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps. But in fact  in a few years  organizations will know so much about us  they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them  and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them. Now there was one English author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort. Even more so than George Orwell  the author is  of course  Aldous Huxley. In  Brave New World   he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us. However  in the book  he also offers us a way out of that society  similar to the path that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden. In the words of the Savage  regaining autonomy and freedom is possible  although the price to pay is steep. So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information  the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom  rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us. Right now  many of us do not even know that the fight is going on  but it is  whether you like it or not. And at the risk of playing the serpent  I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here  the awareness of what is going on  and in your hands  just a few clicks away. Thank you. Hetain Patel   In Chinese  Yuyu Rau  Hi  I'm Hetain. I'm an artist. And this is Yuyu  who is a dancer I have been working with. I have asked her to translate for me. HP   In Chinese  YR  If I may  I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and my artwork. HP   In Chinese  YR  I was born and raised near Manchester  in England  but I'm not going to say it in English to you  because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent. HP   In Chinese  YR  The only problem with masking it with Chinese Mandarin is I can only speak this paragraph  which I have learned by heart when I was visiting in China.  Laughter  So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won't notice. HP   In Chinese  YR  Needless to say  I would like to apologize to any Mandarin speakers in the audience. As a child  I would hate being made to wear the Indian kurta pajama  because I didn't think it was very cool. It felt a bit girly to me  like a dress  and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down. My dad never wore it  so I didn't see why I had to. Also  it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable  that people assume I represent something genuinely Indian when I wear it  because that's not how I feel. HP   In Chinese  YR  Actually  the only way I feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like Li Mu Bai from that film   Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon.  Okay. So my artwork is about identity and language  challenging common assumptions based on how we look like or where we come from  gender  race  class. What makes us who we are anyway  HP   In Chinese  YR  I used to read Spider Man comics  watch kung fu movies  take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee. He would say things like    HP  Empty your mind. Be formless  shapeless  like water. Now you put water into a cup. It becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle  it becomes the bottle. Put it in a teapot  it becomes the teapot. Now  water can flow or it can crash. Be water  my friend.  Applause  YR  This year  I am    years old  the same age Bruce Lee was when he died. I have been wondering recently  if he were alive today  what advice he would give me about making this TED Talk. HP  Don't imitate my voice. It offends me. YR  Good advice  but I still think that we learn who we are by copying others. Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero in the playground  or mum or father  I have. HP  A few years ago  in order to make this video for my artwork  I shaved off all my hair so that I could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from India to the U.K. in the     s. He had a side parting and a neat mustache. At first  it was going very well. I even started to get discounts in Indian shops. But then very quickly  I started to underestimate my mustache growing ability  and it got way too big. It didn't look Indian anymore. Instead  people from across the road  they would shout things like    HP and YR  Arriba  Arriba   ndale   ndale  HP  Actually  I don't know why I am even talking like this. My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore. He talks like this now. So it's not just my father that I've imitated. A few years ago I went to China for a few months  and I couldn't speak Chinese  and this frustrated me  so I wrote about this and had it translated into Chinese  and then I learned this by heart  like music  I guess. YR  This phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card  so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently. When I had learned this phrase  I had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded. I spoke the phrase  and then he laughed and told me   Oh yeah  that's great  only it kind of sounds like a woman.  I said   What   He said   Yeah  you learned from a woman   I said   Yes. So   He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct  and that I had learned it very well  but in a woman's voice. HP  Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk. It doesn't always go as you plan it  even with a talented translator. But I am going to stick with it  because contrary to what we might usually assume  imitating somebody can reveal something unique. So every time I fail to become more like my father  I become more like myself. Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee  I become more authentically me. This is my art. I strive for authenticity  even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect. It's only recently that I've started to understand that I didn't learn to sit like this through being Indian. I learned this from Spider Man. Thank you. I've spent my life working on sustainability. I set up a climate change NGO called The Climate Group. I worked on forestry issues in WWF. I worked on development and agriculture issues in the U.N. system. About    years in total  and then three years ago  I found myself talking to IKEA's CEO about joining his team. Like many people here  well  I want to maximize my personal impact in the world  so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there. But first  let's just take three numbers. The first number is three  three billion people. This is the number of people joining the global middle class by       coming out of poverty. It's fantastic for them and their families  but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today  and this swells that number to five  a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity. The second number is six  This is six degrees centigrade  what we're heading towards in terms of global warming. We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees  we're heading toward six degrees. And if you think about it  all of the weird weather we've been having the last few years  much of that is due to just one degree warming  and we need CO  emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down. It's not inevitable  but we need to act decisively. The third number is     That's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born. You can see my grandmother there. That was in the beginning of the last century. So just    cities. She was born in Manchester  England  the ninth largest city in the world. Now there are     cities  nearly  with a million people or more in them. And if you look at the century from      to       that's the century when we build all the world's cities  the century that we're in the middle of right now. Every other century was kind of practice  and this lays down a blueprint for how we live. So think about it. We're building cities like never before  bringing people out of poverty like never before  and changing the climate like never before. Sustainability has gone from a nice to do to a must do. it's about what we do right here  right now  and for the rest of our working lives. So I'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like IKEA can do  and we have a sustainability strategy called  people and planet positive  to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world. Why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business  Other companies have sustainability strategies. I'm going to refer to some of those as well  and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got. But first  let's think of customers. We know from asking people from China to the U.S. that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day to day issues  the day to day issues of  how do I get my kids to school  Can I pay the bills at the end of the month  Then they care about big issues like climate change. But they want it to be easy  affordable and attractive  and they expect business to help  and they're a little bit disappointed today. So take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products. We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer. We had the early energy efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color. And we had the rough  recycled toilet paper. So every time you pulled on a t shirt  or switched the light on  or went to the bathroom  or sometimes all three together  you were reminded sustainability was about compromise. It wasn't a great start. Today we have choices. We can make products that are beautiful or ugly  sustainable or unsustainable  affordable or expensive  functional or useless. So let's make beautiful  functional  affordable  sustainable products. Let's take the LED. The LED is the next best thing to daylight. The old fashioned lightbulbs  the incandescent bulbs    I'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes  wasting energy every time you switch them on    change them after this    or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not    but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters. They were mis sold for more than a hundred years. They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side. Now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side. You save    percent of the electricity with an LED that you would have done in an old incandescent. And the best thing is  they'll also last for more than    years. So think about that. You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times  probably more if you're in this audience. You'll change your car  if you have one  three or four times. Your kids could go to school  go to college  go away and have kids of their own  come back  bring the grandkids  you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy. So LEDs are fantastic. What we decided to do was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs  the halogens and the CFLs. We decided  over the next two years  we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves. We will go all in. And this is what business needs to do  go all in  go     percent  because then you stop investing in the old stuff  you invest in the new stuff  you lower costs  you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy. It's not just about products in people's homes. We've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products. Obviously there's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials  and we can and will go zero waste. And there's opportunities in a circular economy. But we're still dependent on natural  raw materials. Let's take cotton. Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people are wearing cotton right now. It's a brilliant textile in use. It's really dirty in production. It uses lots of pesticides  lots of fertilizer  lots of water. So we've worked with others  with other businesses and NGOs  on the Better Cotton Initiative  working right back down to the farm  and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs  the yields increase  and    percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports. Yields increase  and you halve the input costs. Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it. Already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached  and now we've got    percent better cotton in our business. Again  we're going all in. By       we'll be     percent Better Cotton. Take the topic of     percent targets  actually. People sometimes think that     percent's going to be hard  and we've had the conversation in the business. Actually  we found     percent is easier to do than    percent or    percent. If you have a    percent target  everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the    percent. When it's     percent  it's kind of clear  and businesspeople like clarity  because then you just get the job done. So  wood. We know with forestry  it's a choice. You've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale  or you can have fantastic  responsible forestry that we can be proud of. It's a simple choice  so we've worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council  with literally hundreds of other organizations  and there's a point here about collaboration. So hundreds of others  of NGOs  of forest workers' unions  and of businesses  have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council  which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry's good on the ground. Now together  through our supply chain  with partners  we've managed to certify    million hectares of forestry. That's about the size of Germany. And we've decided in the next three years  we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business. So be decisive on these issues. Use your supply chain to drive good. But then it comes to your operations. Some things are certain  I think. We know we'll use electricity in    or    years' time. We know the sun will be shining somewhere  and the wind will still be blowing in    or    years' time. So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind  And why not take control of it ourselves  So we're going     percent renewable. By       we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. For all of our stores  our own factories  our distribution centers  we've installed         solar panels so far  and we've got    wind farms we own and operate in six countries  and we're not done yet. But think of a solar panel. A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years. The electricity is free. Every time the sun comes out after that  the electricity is free. So this is a good thing for the CFO  not just the sustainability guy. Every business can do things like this. But then we've got to look beyond our operations  and I think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain. Many businesses now  fortunately  have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains  but not every business. Far from it. And this came in IKEA actually in the '  s. We found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain  and people in the business were shocked. And it was clearly totally unacceptable  so then you have to act. So a code of conduct was developed  and now we have    auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor. But it's not just as simple as making sure there's no child labor. You've got to say that's not enough today. I think we'd all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable. So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights  We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights. Increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these  but actually in a survey  many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children. So what we decided to do was  we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us  what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children  We also have a foundation that's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of     million children by     . You know the phrase  you can manage what you measure  Well  you should measure what you care about. If you're not measuring things  you don't care and you don't know. So let's take an example  measure the things that are important in your business. Isn't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women  So we know for our        managers across IKEA that    percent are women today  but it's not enough  and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management. And we do not want to wait another hundred years. So we've launched a women's open network this week in IKEA  and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change. So the message here is  measure what you care about and lead the change  and don't wait a hundred years. So we've gone from sustainability being a nice to do to a must do. It's a must do. It's still nice to do  but it's a must do. And everybody can do something on this as an individual. Be a discerning consumer. Vote with your wallets. Search out the companies that are acting on this. But also  there are other businesses already acting. I mentioned renewable energy. You go to Google or Lego  they're going     percent renewable too  in the same way that we are. On having really good sustainability strategies  there are companies like Nike  Patagonia  Timberland  Marks   Spencer. But I don't think any of those businesses would say they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't. We'll make mistakes going forward  but it's about setting a clear direction  being transparent  having a dialogue with the right partners  and choosing to lead on the issues that really count. So if you're a business leader  if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model  I'd urge you to do so. And together  we can help create a sustainable world  and  if we get it right  we can make sustainability affordable for the many people  not a luxury for the few. Thank you. Africa is booming. Per capita incomes since the year      have doubled  and this boom is impacting on everyone. Life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade. That means if an African child is born today  rather than three days ago  they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan. It's that quick. And HIV infection rates are down    percent          less people a year are getting HIV in sub Saharan Africa. The battle against malaria is being won  with deaths from malaria down    percent  according to the latest World Bank data. And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that. This shouldn't surprise us  because actually  everybody grows. If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year   A.D.  there was admittedly about       years where there wasn't an awful lot of growth. But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians  my ancestors  were actually part of the Industrial Revolution  and in the   th century  growth began to accelerate  and you saw that get quicker and quicker  and it's been impacting everyone. It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland. Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when the inevitable happens. Among the reasons I think it's happening right now is the quality of the leadership across Africa. I think most of us would agree that in the     s  the greatest politician in the world was African  but I'm meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time  and they're doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries. And the West is engaging with that. The West has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub Saharan debt from about    percent of GDP down to about   . At the same time  our debt level's gone up to     and we're all feeling slightly miserable as a result. Politics gets weaker when debt is high. When public sector debt is low  governments don't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe. And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good. The private sector as well. Again  in the West  we have private sector debt of     percent of GDP in Spain  the U.K.  and the U.S. That's an awful lot of debt. Africa  many African countries  are sitting at    to    percent of GDP. If there's any continent that can do what China has done    China's at about     percent of GDP on that chart    if anyone can do what China has done in the last    years  it'll be Africa in the next   . So they've got great government finances  great private sector debt. Does anyone recognize this  In fact  they do. Foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last    years. Back in the '  s  no one touched the continent with a barge pole. And this investment is actually Western led. We hear a lot about China  and they do lend a lot of money  but    percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe  America  Australia  Canada. Ten percent's come from India. And they're investing in energy. Africa produces    million barrels a day of oil now. It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia. And they're investing in telecoms  shopping malls. And this very encouraging story  I think  is partly demographic led. And it's not just about African demographics. I'm showing you the number of     to    year olds in various parts of the world  and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second. Ten years ago  say you're Foxconn setting up an iPhone factory  by chance. You might choose China  which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line  where there's     million young people  and every year until      that's getting bigger. Which means you're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying   Give us a job   and   I don't need a big pay rise  just please give me a job.  Now  that's completely changed now. This decade  we're going to see a     to    percent fall in the number of     to    year olds in China. So where do you set up your new factory  You look at South Asia  and people are. They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh  and they're also looking at Africa. And they're looking at Africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young Africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to     . Now  there's a problem with lots of young people coming into any market  particularly when they're young men. A bit dangerous  sometimes. I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic  If you look at the red line here  what you're going to see is that in       just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub Saharan Africa. Would you set up a factory in sub Sahara in the mid     s  Nobody else did. They chose instead Turkey and Mexico to set up the textiles factories  because their education levels were    to    percent. Today  sub Sahara is at the levels that Turkey and Mexico were at in     . They will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth. So what's Africa looking like today  This is how I look at Africa. It's a bit odd  because I'm an economist. Each little box is about a billion dollars  and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle. South Africa is playing a role. But when I'm thinking about the future  I'm actually most interested in Central  Western and Southern Africa. If I look at Africa by population  East Africa stands out as so much potential. And I'm showing you something else with these maps. I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy. Fragile democracies is the beige color. Strong democracies are the orange color. And what you'll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies. Why does that matter  Because what people want is what politicians try  they don't always succeed  but they try and deliver. And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on. In Ghana in the elections  in December       the battle between the two candidates was over education. One guy offered free secondary school education to all  not just    percent. The other guy had to say  I'm going to build    new schools. He won by a margin. So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education. Education is helping growth and investment  and that's giving budget revenues  which is giving governments more money  which is helping growth through education. It's a positive  virtuous circle. But I get asked this question  and this particular question makes me quite sad  It's   But what about corruption  How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption   And what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth. When you're poor  corruption is not your biggest priority. And the countries on the right hand side  you'll see the per capita GDP  basically every country with a per capita GDP of  say  less than       dollars  has got a corruption score of roughly  what's that  about three  Three out of   . That's not good. Every poor country is corrupt. Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt. How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption  You see the middle class grow. And the way to do that is to invest  not to say I'm not investing in that continent because there's too much corruption. Now  I don't want to be an apologist for corruption. I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe    not in Africa  actually. But what I'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing. Now I'm going to let you in on a little not so secret. Economists aren't great at forecasting. Because the question really is  what happens next  And if you go back to the year       what you'll find is The Economist had a very famous cover   The Hopeless Continent   and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth in Africa over the previous    years    two percent    and they said  what's going to happen in the next    years  They assumed two percent  and that made it a pretty hopeless story  because population growth was two and a half. People got poorer in Africa in the     s. Now       The Economist has a new cover  and what does that new cover show  That new cover shows  well  Africa rising  because the growth over the last    years has been about five and a half percent. I would like to see if you can all now become economists  because if growth for the last    years has been five and a half percent  what do you think the IMF is forecasting for the next five years of growth in Africa  Very good. I think you're secretly saying to your head  probably five and a half percent. You're all economists  and I think  like most economists  wrong. No offense. What I like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what Africa has already done  and it means that jump from       years of nothing to whoof  suddenly shooting through the roof. India is one of those examples. This is Indian growth from      to     . Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second. Actually  for the first    years  the '  s and '  s  India didn't really grow. It grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half. If that's familiar  that's exactly what happened in sub Sahara in the '  s and the '  s. And then something happened in     . Boom  India began to explode. It wasn't a  Hindu rate of growth    democracies can't grow.  Actually India could. And if I lay sub Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story  it's remarkably similar. Twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub Saharan African growth is slightly better than India. And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this  I'm saying India is    years ahead of Africa  I'm saying developing Asia is    years ahead of India  I can draw out some forecasts for the next    to    years which I think are better than the ones where you're looking backwards. And that tells me this  that Africa is going to go from a    trillion economy today to a     trillion economy by     . Now that's bigger than Europe and America put together in today's money. Life expectancy is going to go up by    years. The population's going to double from one billion to two billion  so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold in the next    years. And when I present this in Africa    Nairobi  Lagos  Accra    I get one question.  Charlie  why are you so pessimistic   And you know what  Actually  I think they've got a point. Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned  yes from the positives in Asia and India  but also the negatives  Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made. Surely  the technologies that we're talking about here this last week  surely some of these can perhaps help Africa grow even faster  And I think here we can play a role. Because technology does let you help. You can go and download some of the great African literature from the Internet now. No  not right now  just    seconds. You can go and buy some of the great tunes. My iPod's full of them. Buy African products. Go on holiday and see for yourself the change that's happening. Invest. Perhaps hire people  give them the skills that they can take back to Africa  and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the West. And then you and I can help make sure that for Africa  the   st century is their century. Thank you very much. So when I was eight years old  a new girl came to join the class  and she was so impressive  as the new girl always seems to be. She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case  super strong on state capitals  just a great speller. And I just curdled with jealousy that year  until I hatched my devious plan. So one day I stayed a little late after school  a little too late  and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. When the coast was clear  I emerged  crept into the classroom  and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. And then I did it. I fiddled with my rival's grades  just a little  just demoted some of those A's. All of those A's.  Laughter  And I got ready to return the book to the drawer  when hang on  some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. So  in a frenzy  I corrected everybody's marks  not imaginatively. I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's  just because I was there  you know  might as well. And I am still baffled by my behavior. I don't understand where the idea came from. I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. I felt great. I don't understand why I was never caught. I mean  it should have been so blatantly obvious. I was never caught. But most of all  I am baffled by  why did it bother me so much that this little girl  this tiny little girl  was so good at spelling  Jealousy baffles me. It's so mysterious  and it's so pervasive. We know babies suffer from jealousy. We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. And yet  I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. For that  we have to go to fiction  because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. In fact  I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy  would we even have literature  Well no faithless Helen  no  Odyssey.  No jealous king  no  Arabian Nights.  No Shakespeare. There goes high school reading lists  because we're losing  Sound and the Fury   we're losing  Gatsby    Sun Also Rises   we're losing  Madame Bovary    Anna K.  No jealousy  no Proust. And now  I mean  I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything  but in the case of jealousy  he kind of does. This year is the centennial of his masterpiece   In Search of Lost Time   and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness  my brand  that we can hope to have.  Laughter  And we think about Proust  we think about the sentimental bits  right  We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. We forget how harsh his vision was. We forget how pitiless he is. I mean  these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. I don't know what cat gut is  but let's assume it's formidable. Let's look at why they go so well together  the novel and jealousy  jealousy and Proust. Is it something as obvious as that jealousy  which boils down into person  desire  impediment  is such a solid narrative foundation  I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone  because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. When we feel jealous  we tell ourselves a story. We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives  and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. As the teller of the tale and the audience  we know just what details to include  to dig that knife in. Right  Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists  and this is something Proust understood. In the first volume  Swann's Way  the series of books  Swann  one of the main characters  is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed  and suddenly  in the course of a few sentences  and these are Proustian sentences  so they're long as rivers  but in the course of a few sentences  he suddenly recoils and he realizes   Hang on  everything I love about this woman  somebody else would love about this woman. Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure  maybe right about now.  And this is the story he starts to tell himself  and from then on  Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress  he adds to his  collection of instruments in his private torture chamber.  Now Swann and Proust  we have to admit  were notoriously jealous. You know  Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right  Jealousy is exhausting. It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed. And what does jealousy like  Jealousy likes information. Jealousy likes details. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair  the cute little pencil case. Jealousy likes photos. That's why Instagram is such a hit.  Laughter  Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. When Swann is in his jealous throes  and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants  he defends these behaviors. He says   You know  look  I know you think this is repugnant  but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument.  He says   They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value.  Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd  but it is  at its crux  a quest for knowledge  a quest for truth  painful truth  and actually  where Proust is concerned  the more painful the truth  the better. Grief  humiliation  loss  These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. He says   A woman whom we need  who makes us suffer  elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us.  Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women  No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way  Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement  Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity  Freud would write about this later. One day  Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. And Freud says  it's something strange about this guy  because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. Because she's blameless  everybody knows it. The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing  unintentional behaviors. Is she smiling too brightly here  or did she accidentally brush up against a man there   Freud  says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious. The novel is very good on this point. The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. In fact  the more intensely jealous we are  the more we become residents of fantasy. And this is why  I think  jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. Now I'm thinking of myself at eight  I concede  but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. A    year old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile  hideous messages to herself for a year. For a year. A year. And she was trying to frame her ex boyfriend's new girlfriend  and I have to confess when I heard this  I just reacted with admiration. Because  I mean  let's be real. What immense  if misplaced  creativity. Right  This is something from a novel. This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel. Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. She's the author of  Strangers on a Train  and  The Talented Mr. Ripley   books that are all about how jealousy  it muddles our minds  and once we're in the sphere  in that realm of jealousy  the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. Take Tom Ripley  her most famous character. Now  Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had  and you're under the floorboards  he's answering to your name  he's wearing your rings  emptying your bank account. That's one way to go. But what do we do  We can't go the Tom Ripley route. I can't give the world D's  as much as I would really like to  some days. And it's a pity  because we live in envious times. We live in jealous times. I mean  we're all good citizens of social media  aren't we  where the currency is envy  Does the novel show us a way out  I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure  when they are in possession of a mystery. Let's go to    B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. When people think of Holmes  they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty  right  this criminal mastermind. But I've always preferred  Inspector  Lestrade  who is the rat faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately  needs Holmes' genius  but resents him. Oh  it's so familiar to me. So Lestrade needs his help  resents him  and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. But as they work together  something starts to change  and finally in  The Adventure of the Six Napoleons   once Holmes comes in  dazzles everybody with his solution  Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says   We're not jealous of you  Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you.  And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand. It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries  and I find it very moving  this little scene  but it's also mysterious  right  It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry  not emotion. You know  one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. The next minute they're on the same side. Suddenly  Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. Could it be so simple though  What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry  just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another  Well  maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. We could align ourselves with it. But I like contingency plans. So while we wait for that to happen  let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. Fiction alone domesticates it  invites it to the table. And look who it gathers  sweet Lestrade  terrifying Tom Ripley  crazy Swann  Marcel Proust himself. We are in excellent company. Thank you. So last year  on the Fourth of July  experiments at the Large Hadron Collider discovered the Higgs boson. It was a historical day. There's no doubt that from now on  the Fourth of July will be remembered not as the day of the Declaration of Independence  but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson. Well  at least  here at CERN. But for me  the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise. In the eye of a theoretical physicist  the Higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass  but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution. Too many questions are left unanswered. The Higgs boson does not share the beauty  the symmetry  the elegance  of the rest of the elementary particle world. For this reason  the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the Higgs boson could not be the full story. We were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the Higgs boson. Instead  so far  the measurements coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena. Of course  the verdict is not definitive. In       the LHC will almost double the energy of the colliding protons  and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world  and we will certainly learn much more. But for the moment  since we have found no evidence for new phenomena  let us suppose that the particles that we know today  including the Higgs boson  are the only elementary particles in nature  even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far. Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us. We will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe  and to explain my point  let me first tell you what the Higgs is about  and to do so  we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang. And according to the Higgs theory  at that instant  a dramatic event took place in the universe. Space time underwent a phase transition. It was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees. But in our case  the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside the material  but is about a change of the very fabric of space time. During this phase transition  empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field. And this substance may seem invisible to us  but it has a physical reality. It surrounds us all the time  just like the air we breathe in this room. And some elementary particles interact with this substance  gaining energy in the process. And this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle  and by discovering the Higgs boson  the LHC has conclusively proved that this substance is real  because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of. And this  in a nutshell  is the essence of the Higgs story. But this story is far more interesting than that. By studying the Higgs theory  theoretical physicists discovered  not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics  that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist only in the form that we observe today. Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid  so the Higgs field  the substance that fills all space time  could exist in two states. Besides the known Higgs state  there could be a second state in which the Higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today  and the mere existence of another state of the Higgs field poses a potential problem. This is because  according to the laws of quantum mechanics  it is possible to have transitions between two states  even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states  and the phenomenon is called  quite appropriately  quantum tunneling. Because of quantum tunneling  I could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room  practically penetrating the wall. But don't expect me to actually perform the trick in front of your eyes  because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small. You would have to wait a really long time before it happens  but believe me  quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon  and it has been observed in many systems. For instance  the tunnel diode  a component used in electronics  works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling. But let's go back to the Higgs field. If the ultra dense Higgs state existed  then  because of quantum tunneling  a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time  and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water. Bubbles of vapor form inside the water  then they expand  turning liquid into gas. In the same way  a bubble of the ultra dense Higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling. The bubble would then expand at the speed of light  invading all space  and turning the Higgs field from the familiar state into a new state. Is this a problem  Yes  it's a big a problem. We may not realize it in ordinary life  but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical for the structure of matter. If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense  we would see atoms shrinking  neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei  nuclei disintegrating  and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe. And the Higgs field  in the ultra dense Higgs state  is not just a few times more intense than today  but billions of times  and if space time were filled by this Higgs state  all atomic matter would collapse. No molecular structures would be possible  no life. So  I wonder  is it possible that in the future  the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and  through quantum tunneling  will be transformed into this nasty  ultra dense state  In other words  I ask myself  what is the fate of the Higgs field in our universe  And the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass. And experiments at the LHC found that the mass of the Higgs boson is about     GeV. This is tiny when expressed in familiar units  because it's equal to something like    to the minus    grams  but it is large in particle physics units  because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a DNA constituent. So armed with this information from the LHC  together with some colleagues here at CERN  we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra dense Higgs state  and we found a very intriguing result. Our calculations showed that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is very special. It has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation. The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse. So according to these calculations  we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff. And eventually  the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself. So is this how humanity is going to disappear  I don't think so. Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next    to the     years  and this is a very long time. It's even longer than the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government. Even so  we will be long gone by then. In about five billion years  our sun will become a red giant  as large as the Earth's orbit  and our Earth will be kaput  and in a thousand billion years  if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate  you will not even be able to see as far as your toes  because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light. So it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse. But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Higgs field is because I want to address the question  why is the Higgs boson mass so special  Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition  Theoretical physicists always ask  why  questions. More than how a phenomenon works  theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works. We think that this these  why  questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature. And indeed  a possible answer to my question opens up new universes  literally. It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles  and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws. And in this context  you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass. Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse. It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach. In principle  you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach  and yet  the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around        degrees. And the reason is simple  because wind builds up the sand  gravity makes it fall. As a result  the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value  near to collapse. And something similar could happen for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse. In the majority of bubble universes  the Higgs mass could be around the critical value  near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field  because of two competing effects  just as in the case of sand. My story does not have an end  because we still don't know the end of the story. This is science in progress  and to solve the mystery  we need more data  and hopefully  the LHC will soon add new clues to this story. Just one number  the Higgs boson mass  and yet  out of this number we learn so much. I started from a hypothesis  that the known particles are all there is in the universe  even beyond the domain explored so far. From this  we discovered that the Higgs field that permeates space time may be standing on a knife edge  ready for cosmic collapse  and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach  the multiverse. But I don't know if my hypothesis is right. That's how physics works  A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley. But whichever it turns out to be  there is one thing I'm sure of  The journey will be full of surprises. Thank you. My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions. Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this. Both projects are in emerging countries  one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia. And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture. The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa. And this is the type of building we were shown as an example  to my team and myself  of what we had to design. At first  the first thing I thought was  I want to run away. After seeing a few of these buildings    there are many in the city    we realized that they have three very big points. First  these buildings  they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things. Second  they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside  and then you need a lot of cooling. In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from    to    degrees the whole year. And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia. It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions. Also during our first visit to Ethiopia  I was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open air structure where thousands of people  they go and buy things every day from small vendors. And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. So I thought  this is what I really want to design  not a shopping mall. But the question was how we could do a multistory  contemporary building with these principles. The next challenge was when we looked at the site  that is  in a really growing area of the city  where most of these buildings that you see in the image  they were not there. And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters. So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets  putting all the entrances of the building. And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open air space in the building that self protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops  that change in each floor because of the shape of the void. I also thought  how to close the building  And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions. And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in  and also the light  but in a filtered way. And then the inspiration came from these beautiful  patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses. That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade. And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building. And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night. With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like   This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.  But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell. And also that the idea of the facade was much  much cheaper  not only because of the material compared with the glass  but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore. So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project. And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day. So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof. And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis. And these porches on the roof  all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside. Hopefully by the beginning of next year  because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction. The second example is a master plan of       apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis. And for doing such a big project  the biggest project I've ever designed  I really needed to understand the city of Tunis  but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture. During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this       year old structure that used to be closed by a wall  opened by twelve different gates  connected by almost straight lines. When I went to the site  the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets  creating    initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards. On top of that  we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines  and this modified this initial pattern. And the last operation was to think about the cell  the small cell of the project  like the apartment  as an essential part of the master plan. And for that I thought  what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment  And it's north south  because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation. So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction. And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city. It has these blocks with courtyards  and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians. And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. And it also reinforces this idea of the gates. The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities  such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by  a series of commercial  spaces  that bring activity to the ground floor. The roof  which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction. And it's where all the neighbors  they can go up and socialize  and do activities such as having a two kilometer run in the morning  jumping from one building to another. These two examples  they have a common approach in the design process. And also  they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. In these cities  the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow. For this reason  I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people. Thank you very much. Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies  the really cool companies  the innovative ones  the creative  new economy type companies    Apple  Google  Facebook    are coming out of one particular country  the United States of America  Usually when I say this  someone says   Spotify  That's Europe.  But  yeah. It has not had the impact that these other companies have had. Now what I do is I'm an economist  and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company  the industry and the nation  and I work with policymakers worldwide  especially in the European Commission  but recently also in interesting places like China  and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues  Where are the European Googles  What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model  which they understand is different from this old economy growth model  And what is interesting is that often  even if we're in the   st century  we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state. It's talked about in these modern ways  but the idea is that somehow  behind places like Silicon Valley  the secret have been different types of market making mechanisms  the private initiative  whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high risk finance to these innovative companies  the gazelles as we often call them  which traditional banks are scared of  or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions  their products  to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail. But what really interests me  especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world  is the language that's used  the narrative  the discourse  the images  the actual words. So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box. They are more dynamic. Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the      graduating class at Stanford  where he said to be innovative  you've got to stay hungry  stay foolish. Right  So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys  right  And in places like Europe  it might be more equitable  we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S.  but the problem is this damn public sector. It's a bit too big  and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could. And even really respectable newspapers  some that I'm actually subscribed to  the words they use are  you know  the state as this Leviathan. Right  This monster with big tentacles. They're very explicit in these editorials. They say   You know  the state  it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution  but you know what  what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet  We all hope it might be something green  or all of this nanotech stuff  and in order for that stuff to happen   they say    this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution    they say   the state  just stick to the basics  right  Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools. Even fund the basic research  because this is popularly recognized  in fact  as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in  do that  but you know what  Leave the rest to the revolutionaries.  Those colorful  out of the box kind of thinkers. They're often called garage tinkerers  because some of them actually did some things in garages  even though that's partly a myth. And so what I want to do with you in  oh God  only    minutes  is to really think again this juxtaposition  because it actually has massive  massive implications beyond innovation policy  which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers. It has huge implications  even with this whole notion that we have on where  when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which  of course  as we know  are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition. Right  I mean  the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum  or something. So these kind of words are constantly  these juxtapositions come up everywhere  not just with innovation policy. And so to think again  there's no reason that you should believe me  so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on  but you might want to take it out  your iPhone. Ask who actually funded the really cool  revolutionary thinking out of the box things in the iPhone. What actually makes your phone a smartphone  basically  instead of a stupid phone  So the Internet  which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world  GPS  where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world  the touchscreen display  which makes it also a really easy to use phone for anybody. These are the very smart  revolutionary bits about the iPhone  and they're all government funded. And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA  U.S. Department of Defense. GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program. Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA. The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware. Now  you might be thinking   Well  she's just said the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot   but what's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department. So the pharmaceutical industry  which I am personally very interested in because I've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth  is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non revolutionary bits  because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental. So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs  whereas the slight variations of existing drugs    Viagra  different color  different dosage    are the less revolutionary ones. And it turns out that a full    percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring  Kafka ian public sector labs. This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation. They do. They spend on the marketing part. They spend on the D part of R D. They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock  which is quite problematic. In fact  companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R D  but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about. Now  what's interesting in all of this is the state  in all these examples  was doing so much more than just fixing market failures. It was actually shaping and creating markets. It was funding not only the basic research  which again is a typical public good  but even the applied research. It was even  God forbid  being a venture capitalist. So these SBIR and SDTR programs  which give small companies early stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital  but also have become increasingly important. Why  Because  as many of us know  V.C. is actually quite short term. They want their returns in three to five years. Innovation takes a much longer time than that     to    years. And so this whole notion    I mean  this is the point  right  Who's actually funding the hard stuff  Of course  it's not just the state. The private sector does a lot. But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics  but not really providing that sort of high risk  revolutionary thinking out of the box. In all these sectors  from funding the Internet to doing the spending  but also the envisioning  the strategic vision  for these investments  it was actually coming within the state. The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this  because the word itself  nanotechnology  came from within government. And so there's huge implications of this. First of all  of course I'm not someone  this old fashioned person  market versus state. What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public private partnerships. But the point is  by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually    pffff    a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan  I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public private partnerships in a really dynamic way. Even the words that we often use to justify the  P  part  the public part    well  they're both P's    with public private partnerships is in terms of de risking. What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you  and there's many more  which myself and other colleagues have been looking at  is doing much more than de risking. It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on. It's actually been the one thinking out of the box. But also  I'm sure you all have had experience with local  regional  national governments  and you're kind of like   You know what  that Kafka ian bureaucrat  I've met him.  That whole juxtaposition thing  it's kind of there. Well  there's a self fulfilling prophecy. By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant  boring  it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way. So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations. DARPA  that funded the Internet and Siri  actually thought really hard about this  how to welcome failure  because you will fail. You will fail when you innovative. One out of    experiments has any success. And the V.C. guys know this  and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success. And this brings me  actually  probably  to the biggest implication  and this has huge implications beyond innovation. If the state is more than just a market fixer  if it actually is a market shaper  and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk  what happened to the reward  We all know  if you've ever taken a finance course  the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk reward relationship  and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait  to actually invest in stocks  because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds  that whole risk reward thing. Well  where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet  The Internet was crazy. It really was. I mean  the probability of failure was massive. You had to be completely nuts to do it  and luckily  they were. Now  we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk taker. And the problem is that economists often think  well  there is a reward back to the state. It's tax. You know  the companies will pay tax  the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism. Well  unfortunately  that's not true. Okay  it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad. Globalization  and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic. Let the jobs go where they have to go  perhaps. I mean  one can take a position on that. But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state    Apple's a great example. They even got the first    well  not the first  but         dollars actually went to Apple  the company  through this SBIC program  which predated the SBIR program  as well as  as I said before  all the technologies behind the iPhone. And yet we know they legally  as many other companies  pay very little tax back. So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax. Why not  It could happen perhaps through equity. This  by the way  in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically  countries like Finland in Scandinavia  but also in China and Brazil  they're retaining equity in these investments. Sitra funded Nokia  kept equity  made a lot of money  it's a public funding agency in Finland  which then funded the next round of Nokias. The Brazilian Development Bank  which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology  they just announced a     billion program for the future on this  is retaining equity in these investments. So to put it provocatively  had the U.S. government thought about this  and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund  you can bet that  you know  if even just .   percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund  there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology. Instead  many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained. But perhaps even more important  we heard before about the one percent  the    percent. If the state is thought about in this more strategic way  as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism  because that's what we're talking about  right  Who are the different players in creating value in the economy  and is the state's role  has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player  If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back  it might just be that in the next round  and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green  that that period of growth will not only be smart  innovation led  not only green  but also more inclusive  so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth  because they have not. Thank you. I'm going to start by asking you a question  Is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem  Okay  so most of you are. I think we can all agree it's a serious issue. Nobody wants to drink blue algae contaminated water  or swim in a blue algae infested lake. Right  I hope you won't be disappointed  but today  I won't be talking about blue algae. Instead  I'll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue  which I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis. Why have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today  For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it. And by the end of my presentation  I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis and this issue. Now  the problem is that if I ask  why do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae  The answer is that it comes from how we farm. We use fertilizers in our farming  chemical fertilizers. Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture  Basically  to help plants grow and to produce a better yield. The issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent. Before going further  let me give you a crash course in plant biology. So  what does a plant need in order to grow  A plant  quite simply  needs light  it needs CO   but even more importantly  it needs nutrients  which it draws from the soil. Several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements  phosphorus  nitrogen and calcium. So  the plant s roots will extract these resources. Today I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus. Why phosphorus in particular  Because it is the most problematic chemical element. By the end of my presentation  you will have seen what these problems are  and where we are today. Phosphorus is a chemical element that is essential to life. This is a very important point. I d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is. Phosphorus is a key component in several molecules  in many of our molecules of life. Experts in the field will know that cellular communication is phosphorus based    phosphorylation  dephosphorylation. Cell membranes are phosphorus based  These are called phospholipids. The energy in all living things  ATP  is phosphorus based. And more importantly still  phosphorus is a key component of DNA  something everyone is familiar with  and which is shown in this image. DNA is our genetic heritage. It is extremely important  and once again  phosphorus is a key player. Now  where do we find this phosphorus  As humans  where do we find it  As I explained earlier  plants extract phosphorus from the soil  through water. So  we humans get it from the things we eat  plants  vegetables  fruits  and also from eggs  meat and milk. It s true that some humans eat better than others. Some are happier than others. And now  looking at this picture  which speaks for itself  we see modern agriculture  which I also refer to as intensive agriculture. Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers. Without them  we would not manage to produce enough to feed the world's population. Speaking of humans  there are currently   billion of us on Earth. In less than    years  there will be   billion of us. And the question is a simple one  Do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations  So  in order to understand these issues  where do we find our phosphorus  Let me explain. But first  let s just suppose that we are using     percent of a given dose of phosphorus. Only    percent of this     percent goes to the plant. Eighty five percent is lost. It goes into the soil  ending its journey in the lakes  resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus  which leads to the blue algae problem. So  you ll see there s a problem here  something that is illogical. A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used  but only    percent goes to the plant. You re going to tell me it s wasteful. Yes  it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive. Nobody wants to throw their money out the window  but unfortunately that's what is happening here. Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost. Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus. And because in order to get    percent of it to the plant  all the rest is lost  we have to add more and more. Now  where will we get this phosphorus from  Basically  we get it out of mines. This is the cover of an extraordinary article published in Nature in       which really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis. Phosphorus  a nutrient essential to life  which is becoming increasingly scarce  yet nobody is talking about it. And everyone agrees  Politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis. What you are seeing here is an open pit mine in the U.S.  and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine  if you look in the top right hand corner  the little crane you can see  that is a giant crane. So that really puts it into perspective. So  we get phosphorus from mines. And if I make a comparison with oil  there s an oil crisis  we talk about it  we talk about global warming  yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis. To come back to the oil problem  oil is something we can replace. We can use biofuels  or solar power  or hydropower  but phosphorus is an essential element  indispensable to life  and we can t replace it. What is the current state of the world's phosphorus reserves  This graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today. The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves. In       we ll reach the peak. By the end of this century  it will all be gone. The dotted line shows where we are today. As you can see  they meet in       I ll be retired by then. But we are indeed heading for a major crisis  and I d like people to become aware of this problem. Do we have a solution  What are we to do  We are faced with a paradox. Less and less phosphorus will be available. By      there will be   billion of us  and according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization  we will need to produce twice as much food in      than we do today. So  we will have less phosphorus  but we'll need to produce more food. What should we do  It truly is a paradoxical situation. Do we have a solution  or an alternative which will allow us to optimize phosphorus use  Remember that    percent is destined to be lost. The solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time  even before plants existed on Earth  and it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious  very simple  and yet also extremely complex. I've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over    years now. It has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research. This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots. By symbiosis  I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza. This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza. You re looking at the root of wheat  one of the world s most important plants. Normally  a root will find phosphorus all by itself. It will go in search of phosphorus  but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it. Beyond one millimeter  the root is ineffective. It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus. Now  imagine this tiny  microscopic mushroom. It grows much faster  and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus. It can go beyond the root s one millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus. I haven t invented anything at all  it's a biotechnology that has existed for     million years. And over time  this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus  and to put it to use  to make it available to the plant. What you re seeing here  in the real world  is a carrot root  and the mushroom with its very fine filaments. Looking closer  we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration. It will proliferate between the root's cells  eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure  which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom. And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur. It s a win win trade  I give you phosphorus  and you feed me. True symbiosis. Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier. And instead of using a     percent dose  I m going to reduce it to    percent. You ll see that of this    percent  most will benefit the plant  more than    percent. A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil. That's completely natural. What's more is that in certain cases  we don't even need to add phosphorus. If you recall the graphs I showed you earlier     percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil  and the plants are unable to access it. Even though it is present in the soil  it is in insoluble form. The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms. The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use. To further support my argument  here is a picture that speaks for itself. These are trials in a field of sorghum. On the left side  you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture  with a     percent phosphorus dose. On the other side  the dose was reduced to    percent  and just look at the yield. With only a half dose  we achieved a better yield. This is to show you that this method works. And in some cases  in Cuba  Mexico and India  the dose can be reduced to    percent  and in several other cases  there's no need to add any phosphorus at all  because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil. This is an example of soy production in Canada. Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other. And here  where blue indicates a better yield  and yellow a weaker yield. The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added. In other words  as I already said  I have invented nothing. Mycorrhiza has existed for     million years  and it has even helped modern day plant species to diversify. So  this it isn't something that is still undergoing lab tests. Mycorrhiza exists  it works  it's produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide. The problem is that people are not aware of it. People like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem. We have a technology that works  and one that  if used correctly  will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves. In conclusion  I am a scientist and a dreamer. I'm passionate about this topic. So if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is  which will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak  it would be that we use one label   Made with mycorrhiza   and that my children and grandchildren buy products bearing that label too. Thank you for your attention. I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy  and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me. Half the city was dark because of a power cut  and I was living on the dark side. Now  Maui was terrified of the dark  so I had to carry him up the stairs  actually down the stairs first  for his walk  and then bring him back up. I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day. And through all of this  I had to hold a torch between my teeth. The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread. For a shower  I walked    blocks to a branch of my gym. But these were not the major preoccupations of my day. It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices. I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points. I wasn't the only one. Even in the rain  people stood between Madison and  th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street. Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology  and yet here we were  obsessed about being wired. I think there's nothing like a crisis to tell you what's really important and what's not  and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter. The self as we once knew it no longer exists  and I think that an abstract  digital universe has become a part of our identity  and I want to talk to you about what I think that means. I'm a novelist  and I'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common. They're both stories  interpretations. You and I can experience things without a story. We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless. But the larger sense that we have of our lives  the slightly more abstract one  is indirect. Our story of our life is based on direct experience  but it's embellished. A novel needs scene after scene to build  and the story of our life needs an arc as well. It needs months and years. Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters. But the story is not about these chapters. It's the whole book. It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness  the victories and the disappointments  but it's because how because of these  and sometimes  more importantly  in spite of these  we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves. Our story  therefore  needs two dimensions of time  a long arc of time that is our lifespan  and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment. Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment  but the one that narrates needs several moments  a whole sequence of them  and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time. Now  the flow of time is embedded in everything  in the erosion of a grain of sand  in the budding of a little bud into a rose. Without it  we would have no music. Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time  regret or nostalgia about the past  hope or dread about the future. I think that technology has altered that flow of time. The overall time that we have for our narrative  our lifespan  has been increasing  but the smallest measure  the moment  has shrunk. It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time  and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world  and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers. All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen. Science can do things with and in a picosecond  but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second. You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow  to the sun  the moon and the seasons  and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past  the present and the future to see things for what they are  to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations. We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect  not just in the material world  but in our own intentions and our motivations. What happens when that arrow goes awry  What happens when time warps  So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one. We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time. Far away over there is now here. News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi. And that's not all. Your last job  your dinner reservations from last year  your former friends  lie on a flat plain with today's friends  because the Internet also archives  and it warps the past. With no distinction left between the past  the present and the future  and the here or there  we are left with this moment everywhere  this moment that I'll call the digital now. Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now  This digital now is not the present  because it's always a few seconds ahead  with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones. This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book. This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state. Its focus  instead  is to distract us at every turn on the road. Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else. Are you reading an interview by an author  Why not buy his book  Tweet it. Share it. Like it. Find other books exactly like his. Find other people reading those books. Travel can be liberating  but when it is incessant  we become permanent exiles without repose. Choice is freedom  but not when it's constantly for its own sake. Not just is the digital now far from the present  but it's in direct competition with it  and this is because not just am I absent from it  but so are you. Not just are we absent from it  but so is everyone else. And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror. I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night  shop for Parisian macarons  and leave video messages that get picked up later. At all times  I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you  while I sustain the illusion that I'm tapped into you in real time. Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter. There were those with power and water  and those without. There are those who went back to their lives  and those who are still displaced after so many months. For some reason  technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does  and then  like an ironic slap in the face  it makes it true. For example  it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets. Now if this rift  which is already so great in many parts of the world  between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology  isn't somehow bridged  there will be ruptures between the digital and the real. For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it  the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous. How does one live inside distraction  We might think that those younger than us  those who are born into this  will adapt more naturally. Possibly  but I remember my childhood. I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me. Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube  and Vienna had a Spanish riding school. If I were a child today  I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks  but it really wouldn't be the same  because much later  I went to Vienna  and I went to the Spanish riding school  and I could feel my grandfather right beside me. Night after night  he took me up on the terrace  on his shoulders  and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me. And even here  when I look at the Great Bear  I get back that feeling of being a child  hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder  and I can get back that feeling of being a child again. What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact  but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact. Time warping technology challenges our deepest core  because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget  even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable. We want to clutch  and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments. They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them. By archiving everything  we think that we can store it  but time is not data. It cannot be stored. You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment. It might have happened while we were playing an instrument  or looking into the eyes of someone we've known for a very long time. At such moments  our selves are complete. The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one. The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future. The present joins a flow of time from before and after. I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother. I wanted to learn to skip  and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it. I wanted to learn to cook  and she kept me in the kitchen  cutting  cubing and chopping for a whole month. My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take  that time can't be fought  and because it will pass and it will move  we owe the present moment our full attention. Attention is time. One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention  and definitely from my grandmother  love and attention were one and the same thing. The digital world cannibalizes time  and in doing so  I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves. It threatens the flow of love. But we don't need to let it. We can choose otherwise. We've seen again and again just how creative technology can be  and in our lives and in our actions  we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it. We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time. We can choose to take time back. Thank you. Three years ago  I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four. My Geiger counter dosimeter  which measures radiation  was going berserk  and the closer I got  the more frenetic it became  and frantic. My God. I was there covering the   th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident  as you can see by the look on my face  reluctantly so  but with good reason  because the nuclear fire that burned for    days back in      released     times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima  and the sarcophagus  which is the covering over reactor number four  which was hastily built    years ago  now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation. So I was filming. I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast. But then  I looked into the distance  and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse  and I'm thinking  who could be living here  I mean  after all  Chernobyl's soil  water and air  are among the most highly contaminated on Earth  and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone  or dead zone  and it's a nuclear police state  complete with border guards. You have to have dosimeter at all times  clicking away  you have to have a government minder  and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring. The point being  no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone. But they are. It turns out an unlikely community of some     people are living inside the zone. They're called self settlers. And almost all of them are women  the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol  cigarettes  if not radiation. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident  but not everybody accepted that fate. The women in the zone  now in their   s and   s  are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and  it would seem  common sense  and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone. They did so illegally. As one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time   Shoot me and dig the grave. Otherwise  I'm going home.  Now why would they return to such deadly soil  I mean  were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them  or both  The thing is  they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently. Now around Chernobyl  there are scattered ghost villages  eerily silent  strangely charming  bucolic  totally contaminated. Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident  but a few are left like this  kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy. Others have a few residents in them  one or two  babushkas   or  babas   which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother. Another village might have six or seven residents. So this is the strange demographic of the zone    isolated alone together. And when I made my way to that piping chimney I'd seen in the distance  I saw Hanna Zavorotnya  and I met her. She's the self declared mayor of Kapavati village  population eight. And she said to me  when I asked her the obvious   Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does.  And you have to remember  these women have survived the worst atrocities of the   th century. Stalin's enforced famines of the     s  the Holodomor  killed millions of Ukrainians  and they faced the Nazis in the '  s  who came through slashing  burning  raping  and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor. So when a couple decades into Soviet rule  Chernobyl happened  they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible. So they returned to their villages and are told they're going to get sick and die soon  but five happy years  their logic goes  is better than    stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of Kiev  separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies  the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon. For them  environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation. It turns out this holds true for other species as well. Wild boar  lynx  moose  they've all returned to the region in force  the very real  very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans. The dead zone  it turns out  is full of life. And there is a kind of heroic resilience  a kind of plain spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at   a.m. pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes  their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka. And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.  They told us our legs would hurt  and they do. So what   I mean  what about their health  The benefits of hardy  physical living  but an environment made toxic by a complicated  little understood enemy  radiation. It's incredibly difficult to parse. Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught. The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl related deaths at        eventually. Greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands. Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high  and that Chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere  higher levels of anxiety  depression  alcoholism  unemployment and  importantly  disrupted social networks. Now  like many of you  I have moved maybe        times in my life. Home is a transient concept. I have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil. So it's hard for us to understand  but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka  and connection to the land is palpable. And perhaps because these Ukrainian women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets  aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time.  If you leave  you die.   Those who left are worse off now. They are dying of sadness.   Motherland is motherland. I will never leave.  What sounds like faith  soft faith  may actually be fact  because the surprising truth    I mean  there are no studies  but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last    years  have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation  by some estimates up to    years. How could this be  Here's a theory  Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil  the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms  actually affect longevity  The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative. Home and community are forces that rival even radiation. Now radiation or not  these women are at the end of their lives. In the next decade  the zone's human residents will be gone  and it will revert to a wild  radioactive place  full only of animals and occasionally daring  flummoxed scientists. But the spirit and existence of the babushkas  whose numbers have been halved in the three years I've known them  will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with  about the relative nature of risk  about transformative connections to home  and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self determination. Thank you.
