A few years ago  I felt like I was stuck in a rut  so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher  Morgan Spurlock  and try something new for    days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next    days. It turns out    days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit    like watching the news    from your life. There's a few things I learned while doing these    day challenges. The first was  instead of the months flying by  forgotten  the time was much more memorable. This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month. And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder    day challenges  my self confidence grew. I went from desk dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work. For fun  Even last year  I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro  the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my    day challenges. I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough  you can do anything for    days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel  Every November  tens of thousands of people try to write their own        word novel  from scratch  in    days. It turns out  all you have to do is write       words a day for a month. So I did. By the way  the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day. You might be sleep deprived  but you'll finish your novel. Now is my book the next great American novel  No. I wrote it in a month. It's awful. But for the rest of my life  if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party  I don't have to say   I'm a computer scientist.  No  no  if I want to  I can say   I'm a novelist.  So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. I learned that when I made small  sustainable changes  things I could keep doing  they were more likely to stick. There's nothing wrong with big  crazy challenges. In fact  they're a ton of fun. But they're less likely to stick. When I gave up sugar for    days  day    looked like this. So here's my question to you  What are you waiting for  I guarantee you the next    days are going to pass whether you like it or not  so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot  For the next    days. Thanks. So I'm going to tell you a little bit about reimagining food. I've been interested in food for a long time. I taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this. I went to chef school in France. And there is a way the world both envisions food  the way the world writes about food and learns about food. And it's largely what you would find in these books. And it's a wonderful thing. But there's some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established. In the last    years  people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food. In fact  understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking    some of the chemistry  some of the physics and so forth. But that's not in any of those books. There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed  some about new aesthetics  new approaches to food. There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria. He's developed a very avant garde cuisine. A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal  he's developed his avant garde cuisine. None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last    years is in any of those books. None of them are taught in cooking schools. In order to learn them  you have to go work in those restaurants. And finally  there's the old way of viewing food is the old way. And so a few years ago    fours years ago  actually    I set out to say  is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder  Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before  So we tried  and I'll show you what we came up with. This is a picture called a cutaway. This is actually the first picture I took in the book. The idea here is to explain what happens when you steam broccoli. And this magic view allows you to see all of what's happening while the broccoli steams. Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact. And the hope was two fold. One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli. But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical  maybe a little bit more scientific  maybe a little bit more chef y than they otherwise would have. Because with that beautiful photo  maybe I can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time. Steaming ought to be faster. It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation  and this explains that. Well  that first cutaway picture worked  so we said   Okay  let's do some more.  So here's another one. We discovered why woks are the shape they are. This shaped wok doesn't work very well  this caught fire three times. But we had a philosophy  which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second. And one of our canning cutaways. Once you start cutting things in half  you kind of get carried away  so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan. And each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on. In this case  boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic. You don't have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores can't grow in the acid. So this is great for pickled vegetables  which is what we're canning here. Here's our hamburger cutaway. One of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish. So you can lavish all the same care  all the same technique  on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish. And if you do lavish as much technique as possible  and you try to make the highest quality hamburger  it gets to be a little bit involved. The New York Times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called  The Wait for the    Hour Hamburger Just Got Longer.  Because our hamburger recipe  our ultimate hamburger recipe  if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff  it does take about    hours. Of course  you're not actually working the whole time. Most of the time is kind of sitting there. The point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers  because  believe it or not  there is something to the physics and chemistry    in particular  those flames underneath the burger. Most of the characteristic char grilled taste doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal. Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference. Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing  or burning. So it's the fat that drips down and flares up that causes the characteristic taste. Now you might wonder  how do we make these cutaways  Most people assume we use Photoshop. And the answer is  no  not really  we use a machine shop. And it turns out  the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half. So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world. We cut a        restaurant oven in half. The manufacturer said   What would it take for you to cut one in half   I said   It would have to show up free.  And so it showed up  we used it a little while  we cut it in half. Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots. We would glue a piece of Pyrex or heat resistant glass in front. We used a red  very high temperature silicon to do that. The great thing is  when you cut something in half  you have another half. So you photograph that in exactly the same position  and then you can substitute in    and that part does use Photoshop    just the edges. So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air  supported by wires  and then they take the wires away digitally so you're flying through the air. In most cases  though  there was no glass. Like for the hamburger  we just cut the damn barbecue. And so those coals that kept falling off the edge  we kept having to put them back up. But again  it only has to work for a thousandth of a second. The wok shot caught fire three times. What happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh  One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way. But hey  they grow back. In addition to cutaways  we also explain physics. This is Fourier's law of heat conduction. It's a partial differential equation. We have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it. But to make them palatable  we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this. We've got lots of little tidbits in the book. Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage  right  But you probably don't know that much about James Watt. But now you will  we put a biography of James Watt in. It's a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt  and where he got his inspiration. It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey. We also did a lot of calculation. I personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook. Here's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue  or other radiant heat source  goes as you move away from it. So as you move vertically away from this surface  the heat falls off. As you move side to side  it moves off. That horn shaped region is what we call the sweet spot. That's the place where the heat is even to within    percent. So that's the place where you really want to cook. And it's got this funny horn shaped thing  which as far as I know  again  the first cookbook to ever do this. Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it. You know  there's two ways you can make a product. You can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want  or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it. Here's a step by step that shows grinding hamburger. If you really want great hamburger  it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain. And it's really simple  as you can see here. As it comes out of the grinder  you just have a little tray  and you just take it off in little passes  build it up  slice it vertically. Here's the final hamburger. This is the    hour hamburger. We make every aspect of this burger. The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it. We also have things about how to make the bun. There's a mushroom  ketchup    it goes on and on. Now watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here. The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics. Isn't that beautiful  We have a very high speed camera  which we had lots of fun with on the book. The key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of      . That's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn. So it's a great illustration of that. Now I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual. We have a chapter on gels. And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI  I thought  well  let's put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin. Well  if you have a high speed camera  and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around  pretty soon somebody does this. Now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot    that's why you shouldn't get shot. The other amazing thing is  when this ballistics gelatin comes down  it falls back down as a nice block. Anyway  here's the book. Here it is.       pages. And they're nice big pages too. A friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen  so there's a sixth volume that has washable  waterproof paper. Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are  There are a quarter of a million    at least those are the ones we know about    a quarter of a million species of flowering plants. And flowers are a real bugger. They're really difficult for plants to produce. They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources. Why would they go to that bother  And the answer of course  like so many things in the world  is sex. I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures. And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important    there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce. You can take cuttings  they can sort of have sex with themselves  they can pollinate themselves. But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches. Evolution works that way. Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen. Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before. As I say  every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these. And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants. And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on. Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen  and that's a very inefficient process  which is why it gets up our noses so much. Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it  hoping that your sex cells  your male sex cells  which are held within the pollen  will somehow reach another flower just by chance. So all the grasses  which means all of the cereal crops  and most of the trees have wind borne pollen. But most species actually use insects to do their bidding  and that's more intelligent in a way  because the pollen  they don't need so much of it. The insects and other species can take the pollen  transfer it directly to where it's required. So we're aware  obviously  of the relationship between insects and plants. There's a symbiotic relationship there  whether it's flies or birds or bees  they're getting something in return  and that something in return is generally nectar. Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations    the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation. The plant gets something  and the hawk moth spreads the pollen somewhere else. Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way. There are markings on many plants that look like other insects. These are the anthers of a lily  cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it  the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with. And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws  and in a way  it has  it forces the insect to crawl out  getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else. Orchids  there are         at least  species of orchids    amazingly  amazingly diverse. And they get up to all sorts of tricks. They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding. This orchid  known as Darwin's orchid  because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it    you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid. And basically what the insect has to do    we're in the middle of the flower    it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar. And Darwin said  looking at this flower   I guess something has coevolved with this.  And sure enough  there's the insect. And I mean  normally it kind of rolls it away  but in its erect form  that's what it looks like. Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators  then  just as in human sex  people might start to deceive. They might say   I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it   Now this is a plant. This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love  and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom. And this is the mimic. So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant. And here is the long probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic  because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some. So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant  it's also    if you look very closely just at the head end  you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant  if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card. Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom. This flower with its black dots  they might look like black dots to us  but if I tell you  to a male insect of the right species  that looks like two females who are really  really hot to trot. And when the insect gets there and lands on it  dousing itself in pollen  of course  that it's going to take to another plant  if you look at the every home should have one scanning electron microscope picture  you can see that there are actually some patterning there  which is three dimensional. So it probably even feels good for the insect  as well as looking good. And these electron microscope pictures    here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect    you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye  have very  very different textures to what an insect might perceive. And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles. And under the scanning electron microscope  you can see the surface there    really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at. Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect  even to us. I mean  I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast. It's a wonderful  amazing thing. This one's clever. It's called obsidian. I think of it as insidium sometimes. To the right species of bee  this looks like another very aggressive bee  and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away  and  of course  covers itself with pollen. The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects. And this one doesn't have anything for them. So it's deceiving on two levels    fabulous. Here we see ylang ylang  the component of many perfumes. I actually smelt someone with some on earlier. And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy. They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it. This one doesn't smell so good. This is a flower that really  really smells pretty nasty and is designed  again  evolved  to look like carrion. So flies love this. They fly in and they pollinate. This  which is helicodiceros  is also known as dead horse arum. I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like  but this one probably smells pretty much like it. It's really horrible. And blowflies just can't help themselves. They fly into this thing  and they fly all the way down it. They lay their eggs in it  thinking it's a nice bit of carrion  and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs  that the eggs are going to die  but the plant  meanwhile  has benefited  because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower    fantastic. Here's arum  arum maculatum   lords and ladies   or  cuckoo pint  in this country. I photographed this thing last week in Dorset. This thing heats up by about    degrees above ambient temperature    amazing. And if you look down into it  there's this sort of dam past the spadix  flies get attracted by the heat    which is boiling off volatile chemicals  little midges    and they get trapped underneath in this container. They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky. At night they get covered in pollen  which showers down over them  and then the bristles that we saw above  they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out  covered in pollen    fabulous thing. Now if you think that's fabulous  this is one of my great favorites. This is the philodendron selloum. For anyone here from Brazil  you'll know about this plant. This is the most amazing thing. That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long. And it does something that no other plant that I know of does  and that is that when it flowers    that's the spadix in the middle there    for a period of about two days  it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals. So instead of having starch  which is the food of plants  it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat  metabolizing  about the rate of a small cat. And that's twice the energy output  weight for weight  than a hummingbird    absolutely astonishing. This thing does something else which is unusual. Not only will it raise itself to     Fahrenheit     or    degrees Centigrade  for two days  but it keeps constant temperature. There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.  Now why does it do this   I hear you ask. Now wouldn't you know it  there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature. And they get inside  and they get it all on. And the plant showers them with pollen  and off they go and pollinate. And what a wonderful thing it is. Now most pollinators that we think about are insects  but actually in the tropics  many birds and butterflies pollinate. And many of the tropical flowers are red  and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us  we think  and can see the color red very well. But if you look at the spectrum  birds and us  we see red  green and blue and see that spectrum. Insects see green  blue and ultraviolet  and they see various shades of ultraviolet. So there's something that goes on off the end there.  And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is   I hear you ask. Well yes we can. So what is an insect seeing  Last week I took these pictures of rock rose  helianthemum  in Dorset. These are little yellow flowers like we all see  little yellow flowers all over the place. And this is what it looks like with visible light. This is what it looks like if you take out the red. Most bees don't perceive red. And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very  very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got. And that's a real fantastic bull's eye. Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees  any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red. We can't know what's going on in    let alone an insect's    another human being's mind. But the contrast will look something like that  so standing out a lot from the background. Here's another little flower    different range of ultraviolet frequencies  different filters to match the pollinators. And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing. Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property    no flower was damaged in the process of this shot  it was just attached to the tripod  not killed    then under ultraviolet light  look at that. And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light. So maybe the chemical in that would be useful. Finally  there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me    fantastic hidden pattern. And I love the idea of something hidden. I think there's something poetic here  that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter  the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus    actually the clouds of Venus. That's the main use of that filter. Venus  of course  is the god of love and fertility  which is the flower story. And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding  they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death  and particularly at marriage  which  when you think of it  is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another. Thank you very much. There was a time in my life when everything seemed perfect. Everywhere I went  I felt at home. Everyone I met  I felt I knew them for as long as I could remember. And I want to share with you how I came to that place and what I've learned since I left it. This is where it began. And it raises an existential question  which is  if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness  why am I not visible in the photograph  and where is this time and place  This is Los Angeles  California  where I live. This is a police photo. That's actually my car. We're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles  called Cedars Sinai. And the situation is that a car full of paramedics on their way home from the hospital after work have run across the wreckage  and they've advised the police that there were no survivors inside the car  that the driver's dead  that I'm dead. And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver. And when they do  they find that behind the glass  they find me. And my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed  all but two of my ribs  my pelvis and both arms    they're all crushed  but there is still a pulse. And they get me to that nearby hospital  Cedars Sinai  where that night I receive  because of my internal bleeding     units of blood    which means full replacements of all the blood in me    before they're able to staunch the flow. I'm put on full life support  and I have a massive stroke  and my brain drops into a coma. Now comas are measured on a scale from    down to three. Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest. And if you look  you'll see that there's only one way you can score three. It's essentially there's no sign of life from outside at all. I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three  and it is inside that deepest level of coma  on the rim between my life and my death  that I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness of inner space. From my family looking in from outside  what they're trying to figure out is a different kind of existential question  which is  how far is it going to be possible to bridge from the comatose potential mind that they're looking at to an actual mind  which I define simply as the functioning of the brain that is remaining inside my head. Now to put this into a broader context  I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien watching the Earth from outer space  and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television is the Earth channel  and your favorite show is the Human Show. And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting. It's so unpredictable and so fragile. And this is how we began. We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia. The show began with tremendous special effects  because there were catastrophic climate shifts    which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today. Because of the Earth tilting on its axis and those catastrophic climate shifts  we had to figure out how to find better food  and we had to learn    there's Lucy  that's how we all began    we had to learn how to crack open animal bones  use tools to do that  to feed on the marrow  to grow our brains more. So we actually grew our consciousness in response to this global threat. Now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in India  in Madhya Pradesh  there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found. It's a cupule that took    to        blows with a stone tool to create  and it's the first known expression of art on the planet. And the reason it connects us with consciousness today is that all of us still today  the very first shape we draw as a child is a circle. And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle. We create an eye    and the eye that evolves through all of our history. There's the Egyptian god Horus  which symbolizes prosperity  wisdom and health. And that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the United States  which has on it an eye of providence. So watching all of this show from outer space  you think we get it  we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness. Because it's the first thing we draw  we surround ourselves with images of it  it's probably the most common image on the planet. But we don't. We take our consciousness for granted. While I was producing in Los Angeles  I never thought about it for a second. Until it was stripped from me  I never thought about it. And what I've learned since that event and during my recovery is that consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it's never been under threat before. These are just some examples. And the reason I'm so honored to be here to talk today in India is because India has the sad distinction of being the head injury capital of the world. That statistic is so sad. There is no more drastic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury. Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation  which means that India  unless something changes  is accumulating a need for millennia of rehabilitation. What you find in the United States is an injury every    seconds    that's one and a half million every year    stroke every    seconds  Alzheimer's disease  every    seconds somebody succumbs to that. All of these represent gaps between potential mind and actual mind. And here are some of the other categories  if you look at the whole planet. The World Health Organization tells us that depression is the number one disease on Earth in terms of years lived with disability. We find that the number two source of disability is depression in the age group of    to   . Our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate. I discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide. If you look at some of these other items    concussions. Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents are for concussions. If I talk about migraine     percent of the population suffer episodic headaches. Fifteen percent suffer migraines that wipe them out for days on end. All of this is leading    computer addiction  just to cover that  the most frequent thing we do is use digital devices. The average teenager sends       texts every  month . We're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift. So what you'd be wondering  watching the Human Show  is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness  or are we going to continue to retreat  And that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of Cedars Sinai medical center and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind. This is a dense array EEG MRI tracking     channels of information. It's not my EEG at Cedars  it's your EEG tonight and last night. It's the what our minds do every night to digest the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we're asleep to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning. This is how I was when I returned from the hospital after nearly four months. The horseshoe shape you can see on my skull is where they operated and went inside my brain to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life. But if you look into the eye of consciousness  that single eye you can see  I'm looking down  but let me tell you how I felt at that point. I didn't feel empty  I felt everything simultaneously. I felt empty and full  hot and cold  euphoric and depressed because the brain is the world's first fully functional quantum computer  it can occupy multiple states at the same time. And with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged  I felt everything simultaneously. But let's swivel around and look at me frontally. This is now flash forward to the point in time where I've been discharged by the health system. Look into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes. I'm not able to follow a line of text in a book. But the system has moved me on because  as my family started to discover  there is no long term concept in the health care system. Neurological damage     years of rehab  requires a long term perspective. But let's take a look behind my eyes. This is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three dimensional function within the brain. It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension  but in two dimensions I think you can see the beautiful symmetry and illumination of a normal mind at work. Here's my brain. That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke. So my family  as we moved forward and discovered that the health care system had moved us by  had to try to find solutions and answers. And during that process    it took many years    one of the doctors said that my recovery  my degree of advance  since the amount of head injury I'd suffered  was miraculous. And that was when I started to write a book  because I didn't think it was miraculous. I thought there were miraculous elements  but I also didn't think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society. So from this experience of my recovery  I want to share four particular aspects    I call them the four C's of consciousness    that helped me grow my potential mind back towards the actual mind that I work with every day. The first C is cognitive training. Unlike the smashed glass of my car  plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility  with treatment  to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness. Plasticity means that there was always hope for our reason    hope for our ability to rebuild that function. Indeed  the mind can redefine itself  and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva back in the     's. The global perspective is that up to    percent of children in school have learning weaknesses that are not self correcting  but with appropriate treatment  they can be screened for and detected and corrected and avoid their academic failure. But what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone who provides that treatment or care. Here's what my neuropsychologist provided for me when I actually found somebody who could apply it. I'm not a doctor  so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests. Let's just talk about full scale I.Q. Full scale I.Q. is the mental processing    how fast you can acquire information  retain it and retrieve it    that is essential for success in life today. And you can see here there are three columns. Untestable    that's when I'm in my coma. And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of     which is just below average. In the health care system  if you touch average  you're done. That's when I was discharged from the system. What does average I.Q. really mean  It meant that when I was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in    minutes  I might score an F. This is a very  very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system. Then I underwent cognitive training. And let me show you what happened to the right hand column when I did my cognitive training over a period of time. This is not supposed to occur. I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify at the age of eight. Now the Journal of the National Medical Association gave my memoir a full clinical review  which is very unusual. I'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever. But they felt the evidences that there was important  valuable information in the book  and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it. But they asked one question. They said   Is this repeatable   That was a fair question because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me. The answer is yes  and for the first time  it's my pleasure to be able to share two examples. Here's somebody  what they did as they went through cognitive training at ages seven and   . And here's another person in  call it  high school and college. And this person is particularly interesting. I won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests  but they still had a neurologic issue. But that person could be identified as having a learning disability. And with accommodation  they went on to college and had a full life in terms of their opportunities. Second aspect  I still had crushing migraine headaches. Two elements that worked for me here are    the first is    percent  I learned  of head and neck pain is through muscular skeletal imbalance. The craniomandibular system is critical to that. And when I underwent it and found solutions  this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth. Up to    percent of the population have a disorder  disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body. I was fortunate to find a dentist who applied this entire universe of technology you're about to see to establish that if he repositioned my jaw  the headaches pretty much resolved  but that then my teeth weren't in the right place. He then held my jaw in the right position while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment. So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position. This affected my entire body. If that sounds like a very  very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement    How can the jaw affect the entire body     let me simply point out to you  if I ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk  how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand  That tiny misalignment. Bear in mind  there are no nerves in the teeth. That's why the same between the before and after that this shows  it's hard to see the difference. Now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth and see the difference it makes. I still had migraine headaches. The next issue that resolved was that  if    percent of head and neck pain is caused by imbalance  the other    percent  largely    if you set aside aneurysms  brain cancer and hormonal issues    is the circulation. Imagine the blood flowing through your body    I was told at UCLA Medical Center    as one sealed system. There's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it  and around that pipe are the nerves drawing their nutrient supply from the blood. That's basically it. If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system  it bulges someplace else. If that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body  your brain  you get a vascular migraine. This is a level of pain that's only known to other people who suffer vascular migraines. Using this technology  this is mapping in three dimensions. This is an MRI MRA MRV  a volumetric MRI. Using this technology  the specialists at UCLA Medical Center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring. A vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body. And in the following months and years  I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning. Communication  the next C. This is critical. All consciousness is about communication. And here  by great fortune  one of my father's clients had a husband who worked at the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research. Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness  whether to restore hearing to the deaf  vision to the blind or movement to the paralyzed. And I'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed. I've brought with me  from Southern California  the FM device. This is it being held in the hand. It weighs less than a gram. So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime. Five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin. Where does it go inside the body  It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion free for over    years. So it goes in and it stays there. Here are the implantation sites. The concept that they're working towards    and they have working prototypes    is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they're needed. The main unit will then go inside the brain. An FM device in the cortex of the brain  the motor cortex  will send signals in real time to the motor points in the relevant muscles so that the person will be able to move their arm  let's say  in real time  if they've lost control of their arm. And other FM devices implanted in fingertips  on contacting a surface  will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain  so that the person feels a sense of touch. Is this science fiction  No  because I'm wearing the first application of this technology. I don't have the ability to control my left foot. A radio device is controlling every step I take  and a sensor picks up my foot for me every time I walk. And in closing  I want to share the personal reason why this meant so much to me and changed the direction of my life. In my coma  one of the presences I sensed was someone I felt was a protector. And when I came out of my coma  I recognized my family  but I didn't remember my own past. Gradually  I remembered the protector was my wife. And I whispered the good news through my broken jaw  which was wired shut  to my night nurse. And the following morning  my mother came to explain that I'd not always been in this bed  in this room  that I'd been working in film and television and that I had been in a crash and that  yes  I was married  but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash. And during my time in coma  she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix. Now in the dark years that followed  I had to work out what remained for me if everything that made today special was gone. And as I discovered these threats to consciousness and how they are surrounding the world and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day  I discovered what truly remained. I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness  that the Human Show can stay on the air for millennia to come. I believe that we can all rise and shine. Thank you very much. Lakshmi Pratury  Just stay for a second. Just stay here for a second. You know  when I heard Simon's    please sit down  I just want to talk to him for a second    when I read his book  I went to LA to meet him. And so I was sitting in this restaurant  waiting for a man to come by who obviously would have some difficulty ... I don't know what I had in my mind. And he was walking around. I didn't expect that person that I was going to meet to be him. And then we met and we talked  and I'm like  he doesn't look like somebody who was built out of nothing. And then I was amazed at what role technology played in your recovery. And we have his book outside in the bookshop. The thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to  every treatment he got  every near miss he had  and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations. So I think this one detail went past people really quick. Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg. Simon Lewis  I knew when I was timing this that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about    Well this is it. This is the control unit. And this records every single step I've taken for  ooh  five or six years now. And if I do this  probably the mic won't hear it. That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on. When I press it again  it'll chirp three times  and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go. And that's my friend. I mean  I charge it every night. And it works. It works. And what I would love to add because I didn't have time ... What does it do  Well actually  I'll show you down here. This down here  if the camera can see that  that is a small antenna. Underneath my heel  there is a sensor that detects when my foot leaves the ground    what's called the heel lift. This thing blinks all the time  I'll leave it out  so you might be able to see it. But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time. And if you walk faster  if I walk faster  it detects what's called the time interval  which is the interval between each heel lift. And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation. The other things they've worked on    I didn't have time to say this in my talk    is they've restored functional hearing to thousands of deaf people. I could tell you the story  this was going to be an abandoned technology  but Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire   Dr. Schindler.  And he was going to retire    all the technology was going to be lost  because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on because it was a small issue. But there's millions of deaf people in the world  and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now. It works. And the other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind. And this  this is the implantable generation. Because what I didn't say in my talk is this is actually exoskeletal. I should clarify that. Because the first generation is exoskeletal  it's wrapped around the leg  around the affected limb. I must tell you  they're an amazing    there's a hundred people who work in that building    engineers  scientists  and other team members    all the time. Alfred Mann has set up this foundation to advance this research because he saw there's no way venture capital would come in for something like this. The audience is too small. You'd think  there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world  but the audience is too small  and the amount of research  the time it takes  the FDA clearances  the payback time is too long for V.C. to be interested. So he saw a need and he stepped in. He's a very  very remarkable man. He's done a lot of very cutting edge science. LP  So when you get a chance  spend some time with Simon. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning everybody. I work with really amazing  little  itty bitty creatures called cells. And let me tell you what it's like to grow these cells in the lab. I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment. We plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes. And we feed them    sterilely of course    with what we call cell culture media    which is like their food    and we grow them in incubators. Why do I do this  We observe the cells in a plate  and they're just on the surface. But what we're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them. What does that even mean  Well it means growing an actual heart  let's say  or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body. Not only that  but they can also be used for disease models. And for this purpose  traditional cell culture techniques just really aren't enough. The cells are kind of homesick  the dish doesn't feel like their home. And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive. We call this the biomimetic paradigm    copying nature in the lab. Let's take the example of the heart  the topic of a lot of my research. What makes the heart unique  Well  the heart beats  rhythmically  tirelessly  faithfully. We copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes. These electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab. What else do we know about the heart  Well  heart cells are pretty greedy. Nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very  very dense blood supply. In the lab  we micro pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells  and this allows us to flow the cell culture media  the cells' food  through the scaffolds where we're growing the cells    a lot like what you might expect from a capillary bed in the heart. So this brings me to lesson number one  life can do a lot with very little. Let's take the example of electrical stimulation. Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be. On the left  we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that I engineered from rat cells in the lab. It's about the size of a mini marshmallow. And after one week  it's beating. You can see it in the upper left hand corner. But don't worry if you can't see it so well. It's amazing that these cells beat at all. But what's really amazing is that the cells  when we electrically stimulate them  like with a pacemaker  that they beat so much more. But that brings me to lesson number two  cells do all the work. In a sense  tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here  because structural engineers build bridges and big things  computer engineers  computers  but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves. What does this mean for us  Let's do something really simple. Let's remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept. Let's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way.  We are what we eat   could easily be described as   We are what our cells eat.  And in the case of the flora in our gut  these cells may not even be human. But it's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life. Behind every sound  sight  touch  taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us. It begs the question  shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies  I invite you to talk about this with me further  and in the meantime  I wish you luck. May none of your non cancer cells become endangered species. Thank you. So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in     . with one will  one resolve  one cause. Our enemies shall talk themselves to death  and we will fight them with their own confusion. We shall prevail. Narrator  On January   th  Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why      won't be like      .  Rebecca MacKinnon  So the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today. Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free. Fast forward more than two decades  Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store. The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups. His app wasn't reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize. The German magazine Stern  a news magazine  had its app censored because the Apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users  and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout Germany. And more controversially  recently  Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks. So here's the thing. We have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies. Or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed. Or they're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many  or most  of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question. So here's the situation. In a pre Internet world  sovereignty over our physical freedoms  or lack thereof  was controlled almost entirely by nation states. But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace. And their decisions about software coding  engineering  design  terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives. And their sovereignties  cross cutting  globally interlinked  can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation states in very exciting ways  but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world. After all  even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year. And these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in Tunisia and Egypt this past spring and beyond. As Wael Ghonim  the Google Egyptian executive by day  secret Facebook activist by night  famously said to CNN after Mubarak stepped down   If you want to liberate a society  just give them the Internet.  But overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated. On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the Egyptian state security offices in March. And many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles. But some of the files were left behind intact  and activists  some of them  found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges  their cellphone text message exchanges  even Skype conversations. And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces. And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there. And in Tunisia  censorship actually began to return in May    not nearly as extensively as under President Ben Ali. But you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain Facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence. In protest over this  blogger Slim Amamou  who had been jailed under Ben Ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution  he resigned in protest from the cabinet. But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem. In fact  on Twitter  there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said   Well actually  we do want democracy and free expression  but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy. But the problem is  how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power  As Riadh Guerfali  the veteran digital activist from Tunisia  remarked over this incident   Before  things were simple  you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other. Today  things are a lot more subtle.  Welcome to democracy  our Tunisian and Egyptian friends. The reality is that even in democratic societies today  we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks. In fact  in the United States  whatever you may think of Julian Assange  even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks. Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman  despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged  let alone convicted  of any crime. So we assume that the Internet is a border busting technology. This is a map of social networks worldwide  and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world    which is either a good or a bad thing  depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service. But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace. In Brazil and Japan  it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons. But if you look at China  Vietnam and a number of the former Soviet states  what's happening there is more troubling. You have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where  effectively  the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government. Now in China  you have the  great firewall   as it's well known  that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google  and many of the other overseas websites. And that's done in part with the help from Western technology. But that's only half of the story. The other part of the story are requirements that the Chinese government places on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet  known as a system of self discipline. In plain English  that means censorship and surveillance of their users. And this is a ceremony I actually attended in      where the Internet Society of China presented awards to the top    Chinese companies that are best at exercising self discipline    i.e. policing their content. And Robin Li  CEO of Baidu  China's dominant search engine  was one of the recipients. In Russia  they do not generally block the Internet and directly censor websites. But this is a website called Rospil that's an anti corruption site. And earlier this year  there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money. This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable. So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet  which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services. So the important question  I think  is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys. Of course  it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is. The most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the Internet evolves in a citizen centric manner. Because I think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens  and I would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives  not to manipulate or enslave us. So the question is  we know how to hold government accountable. We don't necessarily always do it very well  but we have a sense of what the models are  politically and institutionally  to do that. How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most CEO's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit  And government regulation often isn't helping all that much. You have situations  for instance  in France where president Sarkozy tells the CEO's of Internet companies   We're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest.  But then he goes and champions laws like the infamous  three strikes  law that would disconnect citizens from the Internet for file sharing  which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications  and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens. And here in the United Kingdom there's also concern over a law called the Digital Economy Act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior. So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen centric Internet in the future  we need a broader and more sustained Internet freedom movement. After all  companies didn't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course  or employing    year olds as a matter of course  just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do. It was the result of decades of sustained activism  shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy. Similarly  governments don't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day. It's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations  and that you get the right corporate behavior. We need to make the same approach with the Internet. We also are going to need political innovation. Eight hundred years ago  approximately  the barons of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer working for them so well  and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta  which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules. This set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation  which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed    which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in America across the pond. So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked. And what does that look like  At the moment  we still don't know. But it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics  on geopolitics  but it's also going to need to deal with questions of business management  investor behavior  consumer choice and even software design and engineering. Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around. Thank you very much. Have you ever wondered why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim majority countries over the course of the last decade  Have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around  Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings and thought   How could we have predicted that   or  How could we have better prepared for that   Well my personal story  my personal journey  what brings me to the TED stage here today  is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening in Muslim majority countries over the course of the last decades  at least  and beyond. I want to share some of that story with you  but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim majority societies. So let me begin by first of all giving a very  very brief history of time  if I may indulge. In medieval societies there were defined allegiances. An identity was defined primarily by religion. And then we moved on into an era in the   th century with the rise of a European nation state where identities and allegiances were defined by ethnicity. So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity  and the nation state reflected that. In the age of globalization  we moved on. I call it the era of citizenship    where people could be from multi racial  multi ethnic backgrounds  but all be equal as citizens in a state. You could be American Italian  you could be American Irish  you could be British Pakistani. But I believe now that we're moving into a new age  and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as  the age of behavior.  How I define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances  where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives. And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave. Now this is not all necessarily good news  because it's also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much as love. But actually it's my belief that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior  up until now  up until recent times  up until the last six months  the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances  using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies  those who've been benefiting from this have been extremists. And that's something which I'd like to elaborate on. If we look at Islamists  if we look at the phenomenon of far right fascists  one thing they've been very good at  one thing that they've actually been exceeding in  is communicating across borders  using technologies to organize themselves  to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena. Now I should know  because for    years of my life  I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization. And I was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders  and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism as distinct from Islam the faith  and the way in which it influenced my co religionists across the world. And my story  my personal story  is truly evidence for the age of behavior that I'm attempting to elaborate upon here. I was  by the way    I'm an Essex lad  born and raised in Essex in the U.K. Anyone who's from England knows the reputation we have from Essex. But having been born in Essex  at the age of     I joined an organization. At the age of     I was recruiting people from Cambridge University to this organization. At the age of     I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K. At the age of     I was co founding this organization in Pakistan. At the age of     I was co founding this organization in Denmark. By the age of     I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt  being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments  being subjected to torture in Egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience. Now that journey  and what took me from Essex all the way across the world    by the way  we were laughing at democratic activists. We felt they were from the age of yesteryear. We felt that they were out of date. I learned how to use email from the extremist organization that I used. I learned how to effectively communicate across borders without being detected. Eventually I was detected  of course  in Egypt. But the way in which I learned to use technology to my advantage was because I was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation state. The age of behavior  where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances. So as I said  we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it. And it's not just Islamist extremists that did this. But even if you look across the mood music in Europe of late  far right fascism is also on the rise. A form of anti Islam rhetoric is also on the rise and it's transnational. And the consequences that this is having is that it's affecting the political climate across Europe. What's actually happening is that what were previously localized parochialisms  individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another  have become interconnected in a globalized way and have thus become  or are becoming  mainstream. Because the Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world. If you look at the rise of far right fascism across Europe of late  you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics  yet the phenomenon is transnational. In certain countries  mosque minarets are being banned. In others  headscarves are being banned. In others  kosher and halal meat are being banned  as we speak. And on the flip side  we have transnational Islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies. And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream. Now that never would have been possible before. They would have felt isolated  until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon. Where does that leave democracy aspirants  Well I believe they're getting left far behind. And I'll give you an example here at this stage. If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot  there's a man called Anwar al Awlaki. As an American citizen  ethnically a Yemeni  in hiding currently in Yemen  who inspired a Nigerian  son of the head of Nigeria's national bank. This Nigerian student studied in London  trained in Yemen  boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America. In the meanwhile  the Old mentality with a capital O  was represented by his father  the head of the Nigerian bank  warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack  and this warning fell on deaf ears. The Old mentality with a capital O  as represented by the nation state  not yet fully into the age of behavior  not recognizing the power of transnational social movements  got left behind. And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the United States of America. Again with the example of the far right  that we find  ironically  xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization. So why are they succeeding  And why are democracy aspirants falling behind  Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this. And a social movement is comprised  in my view  it's comprised of four main characteristics. It's comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders. I'll talk you through one example  and that's the example that everyone here will be aware of  and that's the example of Al Qaeda. If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al Qaeda  that's something that comes to your mind immediately. If I ask you to think of their narratives    the West being at war with Islam  the need to defend Islam against the West    these narratives  they come to your mind immediately. Incidentally  the difference between ideas and narratives  the idea is the cause that one believes in  and the narrative is the way to sell that cause    the propaganda  if you like  of the cause. So the ideas and the narratives of Al Qaeda come to your mind immediately. If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders  they come to your mind immediately. One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently. So these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately. And that's the power of social movements. They're transnational  and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders. However  if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan  and I ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in Pakistan today  you'll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. Which means  by definition  that particular leader no longer exists. One of the problems we're facing is  in my view  that there are no globalized  youth led  grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across Muslim majority societies. There is no equivalent of the Al Qaeda  without the terrorism  for democracy across Muslim majority societies. There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground. So that begs the next question. Why is it that extremist organizations  whether of the far right or of the Islamist extremism    Islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of Islam over the rest of society    why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way  whereas those who aspire to democratic culture are falling behind  And I believe that's for four reasons. I believe  number one  it's complacency. Because those who aspire to democratic culture are in power  or have societies that are leading globalized  powerful societies  powerful countries. And that level of complacency means they don't feel the need to advocate for that culture. The second  I believe  is political correctness. That we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that    we associate believing in the universality of our values    with extremists. Yet actually  whenever we talk about human rights  we do say that human rights are universal. But actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with Islamist extremism. To go around saying that I believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism. And the third  democratic choice in Muslim majority societies has been relegated to a political choice  meaning political parties in many of these societies ask people to vote for them as the democratic party  but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party    wanting to rule by military dictatorship. And then you have a third party saying   Vote for us  we'll establish a theocracy.  So democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies. And what happens as a result of this is  when those parties are elected  and inevitably they fail  or inevitably they make political mistakes  democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes. And then people say   We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work. Let's bring the military back again.  And the fourth reason  I believe  is what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance. What I mean by that is  if the world superpower today was a communist  it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism  than it is today with the world superpower being America  occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals. So roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice  not merely as a political choice. When talking about those reasons  let's break down certain preconceptions. Is it just about grievances  Is it just about a lack of education  Well statistically  the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated. Statistically  they are educated  on average  above the education levels of Western society. Anecdotally  we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor  well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia. His deputy  Ayman al Zawahiri  was a pediatrician    not an ill educated man. International aid and development has been going on for years  but extremism in those societies  in many of those societies  has been on the rise. And what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism on the ground  in addition to international aid  in addition to education  in addition to health. Not exclusive to these things  but in addition to them  is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground. And this is where I believe neoconservatism had it upside down. Neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply led approach to impose democratic values from the top down. Whereas Islamists and far right organizations  for decades  have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots. They've been building civilizational demand for their values on the grassroots  and we've been seeing those societies slowly transition to societies that are increasingly asking for a form of Islamism. Mass movements in Pakistan have been represented after the Arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy  rather than for a democratic uprising. Because since pre partition  they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground. And what's needed is a genuine transnational youth led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture    which is necessarily more than just elections. But without freedom of speech  you can't have free and fair elections. Without human rights  you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign. Without freedom of belief  you don't have the right to join organizations. So what's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself to create the demand on the ground for this culture. What that will do is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier  where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy. Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level  rather than merely on a political level  a level above politics    movements that are not political parties  but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture. What we'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here    the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy  not for a democracy. But to get to that stage  where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric  but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship    i.e. you're voting in a democracy  in an existing democracy  and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box. To get to that stage  we genuinely need to start building demand in those societies on the ground. Now to conclude  how does that happen  Well  Egypt is a good starting point. The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning. But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt was particularly cathartic for me. What happened there was a political coalition gathered together for a political goal  and that was to remove the leader. We need to move one step beyond that now. We need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions  loosely based political coalitions  to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground. Because it's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator. That doesn't guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values. But generally  the trends that start in Egypt have historically spread across the MENA region  the Middle East and North Africa region. So when Arab socialism started in Egypt  it spread across the region. In the '  s and '  s when Islamism started in the region  it spread across the MENA region as a whole. And the aspiration that we have at the moment    as young Arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism    is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that. But that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions to building genuinely grassroots based social movements that advocate for the democratic culture. And we've made a start for that in Pakistan with a movement called Khudi  where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy in for the democratic culture. And it's with that thought that I'll end. And my time is up  and thank you for your time. It's the Second World War. A German prison camp. And this man  Archie Cochrane  is a prisoner of war and a doctor  and he has a problem. The problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that Archie doesn't really understand. The symptoms are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin. But he doesn't know whether it's an infection  whether it's to do with malnutrition. He doesn't know how to cure it. And he's operating in a hostile environment. And people do terrible things in wars. The German camp guards  they've got bored. They've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun. On one particular occasion  one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory while it was full of prisoners. He said he heard suspicious laughter. And Archie Cochrane  as the camp doctor  was one of the first men in to clear up the mess. And one more thing  Archie was suffering from this illness himself. So the situation seemed pretty desperate. But Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person. He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp  and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black market. Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is. Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British. It looks like crude oil. It tastes ... zesty. And importantly  it's a rich source of vitamin B  . So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups. He gives half of them vitamin C. He gives half of them vitamin B  . He very carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book. And after just a few days  it becomes clear that whatever is causing this illness  marmite is the cure. So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp. Now you've got to imagine at the moment    forget this photo  imagine this guy with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair. He hasn't been able to shave    a sort of Billy Connolly figure. Cochrane  he starts ranting at these Germans in this Scottish accent    in fluent German  by the way  but in a Scottish accent    and explains to them how German culture was the culture that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world. And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated  and he vents his frustrations. And then he goes back to his quarters  breaks down and weeps because he's convinced that the situation is hopeless. But a young German doctor picks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book and says to his colleagues   This evidence is incontrovertible. If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners  it's a war crime.  And the next morning  supplies of vitamin B   are delivered to the camp  and the prisoners begin to recover. Now I'm not telling you this story because I think Archie Cochrane is a dude  although Archie Cochrane is a dude. I'm not even telling you the story because I think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy  although I think that would also be completely awesome. I'm telling you this story because Archie Cochrane  all his life  fought against a terrible affliction  and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies. And he had a name for it. He called it the God complex. Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very  very easily. So the symptoms of the complex are  no matter how complicated the problem  you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution. Now Archie was a doctor  so he hung around with doctors a lot. And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot. Now I'm an economist  I'm not a doctor  but I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists. I see it in our business leaders. I see it in the politicians we vote for    people who  in the face of an incredibly complicated world  are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works. And you know  with the future billions that we've been hearing about  the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way. Well let me give you an example. Imagine for a moment that  instead of Tim Harford in front of you  there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs. You know Hans  the Mick Jagger of TED. And he'd be showing you these amazing statistics  these amazing animations. And they are brilliant  it's wonderful work. But a typical Hans Rosling graph  think for a moment  not what it shows  but think instead about what it leaves out. So it'll show you GDP per capita  population  longevity  that's about it. So three pieces of data for each country    three pieces of data. Three pieces of data is nothing. I mean  have a look at this graph. This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo. He's at MIT. Now you won't be able to understand a word of it  but this is what it looks like. Cesar has trolled the database of over       different products  and he's used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products. And it's wonderful  wonderful work. You show all these interconnections  all these interrelations. And I think it'll be profoundly useful in understanding how it is that economies grow. Brilliant work. Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine explaining how this works. And what we learned is Cesar's work is far too good to explain in The New York Times Magazine. Five thousand products    that's still nothing. Five thousand products    imagine counting every product category in Cesar Hidalgo's data. Imagine you had one second per product category. In about the length of this session  you would have counted all      . Now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in Walmart. There are         there. It would take you all day. Now imagine trying to count every different specific product and service on sale in a major economy such as Tokyo  London or New York. It's even more difficult in Edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan. If you wanted to count every product and service on offer in New York    there are    billion of them    it would take you     years. This is how complex the economy we've created is. And I'm just counting toasters here. I'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem. The complexity here is unbelievable. And just a piece of context    the societies in which our brains evolved had about     products and services. You could count them in five minutes. So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us. This perhaps is why we find the God complex so tempting. We tend to retreat and say   We can draw a picture  we can post some graphs  we get it  we understand how this works.  And we don't. We never do. Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here. I'm not trying to say we can't solve complicated problems in a complicated world. We clearly can. But the way we solve them is with humility    to abandon the God complex and to actually use a problem solving technique that works. And we have a problem solving technique that works. Now you show me a successful complex system  and I will show you a system that has evolved through trial and error. Here's an example. This baby was produced through trial and error. I realize that's an ambiguous statement. Maybe I should clarify it. This baby is a human body  it evolved. What is evolution  Over millions of years  variation and selection  variation and selection    trial and error  trial and error. And it's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error. You could use it in an industrial context. So let's say you wanted to make detergent. Let's say you're Unilever and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool. How do you do it  Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent. You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle. You create a spray of detergent. Then the spray dries. It turns into powder. It falls to the floor. You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes. You sell it at a supermarket. You make lots of money. How do you design that nozzle  It turns out to be very important. Now if you ascribe to the God complex  what you do is you find yourself a little God. You find yourself a mathematician  you find yourself a physicist    somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid. And he will  or she will  calculate the optimal design of the nozzle. Now Unilever did this and it didn't work    too complicated. Even this problem  too complicated. But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem    trial and error  variation and selection. You take a nozzle and you create    random variations on the nozzle. You try out all     you keep the one that works best. You create    variations on that one. You try out all   . You keep the one that works best. You try out    variations on that one. You see how this works  right  And after    generations  you have this incredible nozzle. It looks a bit like a chess piece    functions absolutely brilliantly. We have no idea why it works  no idea at all. And the moment you step back from the God complex    let's just try to have a bunch of stuff  let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not    you can solve your problem. Now this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize. And we've heard a lot about how economies function. The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy. How did it become the world's greatest economy  I could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the U.S. economy  but I think the most salient one is this  ten percent of American businesses disappear every year. That is a huge failure rate. It's far higher than the failure rate of  say  Americans. Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year. Which leads us to conclude American businesses fail faster than Americans  and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans. And eventually  they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets    if  of course  they haven't already done so. I sometimes wonder. But it's this process of trial and error that explains this great divergence  this incredible performance of Western economies. It didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge. It's come through trial and error. Now I've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months  and people sometimes say to me   Well Tim  it's kind of obvious. Obviously trial and error is very important. Obviously experimentation is very important. Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing   So I say  okay  fine. You think it's obvious  I will admit it's obvious when schools start teaching children that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer. Stop giving them lists of questions every single one of which has an answer. And there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers. And if you can't find the answers  you must be lazy or stupid. When schools stop doing that all the time  I will admit that  yes  it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing. When a politician stands up campaigning for elected office and says   I want to fix our health system. I want to fix our education system. I have no idea how to do it. I have half a dozen ideas. We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail. Then we'll test some other ideas out. We'll find some that work. We'll build on those. We'll get rid of the ones that don't.     when a politician campaigns on that platform  and more importantly  when voters like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politician  then I will admit that it is obvious that trial and error works  and that    thank you. Until then  until then I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the God complex. Because it's so hard to admit our own fallibility. It's so uncomfortable. And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody. There's this one trial he ran many years after World War II. He wanted to test out the question of  where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks  Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital  or should they recover at home  All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down. They had the God complex in spades. They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients  and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment. Nevertheless  Archie managed to get permission to do this. He ran his trial. And after the trial had been running for a little while  he gathered together all his colleagues around his table  and he said   Well  gentlemen  we have some preliminary results. They're not statistically significant. But we have something. And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong. It is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home. They should be in hospital.  And there's this uproar  and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying   We always said you were unethical  Archie. You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now. Shut it down at once.  And there's this huge hubbub. Archie lets it die down. And then he says   Well that's very interesting  gentlemen  because when I gave you the table of results  I swapped the two columns around. It turns out your hospitals are killing people  and they should be at home. Would you like to close down the trial now  or should we wait until we have robust results   Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room. But Cochrane would do that kind of thing. And the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say   Here in my own little world  I am a god  I understand everything. I do not want to have my opinions challenged. I do not want to have my conclusions tested.  It feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law. Cochrane understood that uncertainty  that fallibility  that being challenged  they hurt. And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that. Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy. It isn't easy. It's incredibly painful. And since I started talking about this subject and researching this subject  I've been really haunted by something a Japanese mathematician said on the subject. So shortly after the war  this young man  Yutaka Taniyama  developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama Shimura Conjecture. It turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving Fermat's Last Theorem. In fact  it turns out it's equivalent to proving Fermat's Last Theorem. You prove one  you prove the other. But it was always a conjecture. Taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true. And shortly before his   th birthday in       Yutaka Taniyama killed himself. His friend  Goro Shimura    who worked on the mathematics with him    many decades later  reflected on Taniyama's life. He said   He was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction. I tried to emulate him  but I realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes.  Thank you. Pat Mitchell  You have brought us images from the Yemen Times. And take us through those  and introduce us to another Yemen. Nadia Al Sakkaf  Well  I'm glad to be here. And I would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen. This picture shows a revolution started by women  and it shows women and men leading a mixed protest. The other picture is the popularity of the real need for change. So many people are there. The intensity of the upspring. This picture shows that the revolution has allowed opportunities for training  for education. These women are learning about first aid and their rights according to the constitution. I love this picture. I just wanted to show that over    percent of the Yemeni population are    years and below. And they were excluded from decision making  and now they are in the forefront of the news  raising the flag. English    you will see  this is jeans and tights  and an English expression    the ability to share with the world what is going on in our own country. And expression also  it has brought talents. Yemenis are using cartoons and art  paintings  comics  to tell the world and each other about what's going on. Obviously  there's always the dark side of it. And this is just one of the less gruesome pictures of the revolution and the cost that we have to pay. The solidarity of millions of Yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing. And finally  lots of people are saying that Yemen's revolution is going to break the country. Is it going to be so many different countries  Is it going to be another Somalia  But we want to tell the world that  no  under the one flag  we'll still remain as Yemeni people. PM  Thank you for those images  Nadia. And they do  in many ways  tell a different story than the story of Yemen  the one that is often in the news. And yet  you yourself defy all those characterizations. So let's talk about the personal story for a moment. Your father is murdered. The Yemen Times already has a strong reputation in Yemen as an independent English language newspaper. How did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper  especially in such times of conflict  NA  Well  let me first warn you that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl. I've guessed you've already noticed this by now. In Yemen  most women are veiled and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life. But there's so much potential. I wish I could show you my Yemen. I wish you could see Yemen through my eyes. Then you would know that there's so much to it. And I was privileged because I was born into a family  my father would always encourage the boys and the girls. He would say we are equal. And he was such an extraordinary man. And even my mother    I owe it to my family. A story  I studied in India. And in my third year  I started becoming confused because I was Yemeni  but I was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college. And I went back home and I said   Daddy  I don't know who I am. I'm not a Yemeni  I'm not an Indian.  And he said   You are the bridge.  And that is something I will keep in my heart forever. So since then I've been the bridge  and a lot of people have walked over me. PM  I don't think so.  Laughter  NA  But it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society. And when I became editor in chief after my brother actually    my father passed away in       and then my brother until         and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.  What's this young girl coming in and showing off because it's her family business   or something. It was very hard at first. I didn't want to clash with people. But with all due respect to all the men  and the older men especially  they did not want me around. It was very hard  you know  to impose my authority. But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do. And in the first year  I had to fire half of the men. Brought in more women. Brought in younger men. And we have a more gender balanced newsroom today. The other thing is that it's about professionalism. It's about proving who you are and what you can do. And I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now  but in      alone  we won three international awards. One of them is the IPI Free Media Pioneer Award. So that was the answer to all the Yemeni people. And I want to score a point here  because my husband is in the room over there. If you could please stand up   unclear . He has been very supportive of me. PM  And we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper. But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have  you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper. And so along with changing who worked there  you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into  in particular with women  and it has to do with outside image  dress  the veiled woman. So how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you  NA  As you know  the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered  veiled women. And this is true. And a lot of it is because women are not able  are not free  to show their face to their self. It's a lot of traditional imposing coming by authority figures such as the men  the grandparents and so on. And it's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say   I am as much contributing to this family  or more  than you are.  And the more empowered the women become  the more they are able to remove the veil  for example  or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel. So the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil  and it's economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it. And I have done this throughout my work. I've tried to encourage young girls. We started with  you can take it off in the office. And then after that  you can take it off on assignments. Because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with    how can you talk to people if you have your face covered     and so on  it's just a movement. And I am a role model in Yemen. A lot of people look up to me. A lot of young girls look up to me. And I need to prove to them that  yes  you can still be married  you can still be a mother  and you can still be respected within the society  but at the same time  that doesn't mean you  should  just be one of the crowd. You can be yourself and have your face. PM  But by putting yourself personally out there    both projecting a different image of Yemeni women  but also what you have made possible for the women who work at the paper    has this put you in personal danger  NA  Well the Yemen Times  across    years  has been through so much. We've suffered prosecution  the paper was closed down more than three times. It's an independent newspaper  but tell that to the people in charge. They think that if there's anything against them  then we are being an opposition newspaper. And very  very difficult times. Some of my reporters were arrested. We had some court cases. My father was assassinated. Today  we are in a much better situation. We've created the credibility. And in times of revolution or change like today  it is very important for independent media to have a voice. It's very important for you to go to YemenTimes.com  and it's very important to listen to our voice. And this is probably something I'm going to share with you in Western media probably    and how there's a lot of stereotypes    thinking of Yemen in one single frame  this is what Yemen is all about. And that's not fair. It's not fair for me  it's not fair for my country. A lot of reporters come to Yemen and they want to write a story on Al Qaeda or terrorism. And I just wanted to share with you  there's one reporter that came. He wanted to do a documentary on what his editors wanted. And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me    hip hop    that there are young Yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu. That thing.  PM  Rap. Break dancing.  Yeah  break dancing. I'm not so old. I'm just not in touch. PM  Yes  you are. Actually  that's a documentary that's available online  the video's online. NA  ShaketheDust.org. PM   Shake the Dust.   NA   Shake the Dust.   PM  ShaketheDust.org. And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen. You spoke about the responsibility of the press. And certainly  when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we've created fear and danger  often from lack of knowledge  lack of real understanding  how do you see the way that the Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region  but in particular  in your country  NA  Well there is a saying that says   You fear what you don't know  and you hate what you fear.  So it's about the lack of research  basically. It's almost   Do your homework      some involvement. And you cannot do parachute reporting    just jump into a country for two days and think that you've done your homework and a story. So I wish that the world would know my Yemen  my country  my people. I am an example  and there are others like me. We may not be that many  but if we are promoted as a good  positive example  there will be others    men and women    who can eventually bridge the gap    again  coming to the bridge    between Yemen and the world and telling first about recognition and then about communication and compassion. I think Yemen is going to be in a very bad situation in the next two or three years. It's natural. But after the two years  which is a price we are willing to pay  we are going to stand up again on our feet  but in the new Yemen with a younger and more empowered people    democratic. PM  Nadia  I think you've just given us a very different view of Yemen. And certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for. And the very best of luck to you. YemenTimes.com. NA  On Twitter also. PM  So you are plugged in. I love the Internet. It's true. Think about everything it has brought us. Think about all the services we use  all the connectivity  all the entertainment  all the business  all the commerce. And it's happening during our lifetimes. I'm pretty sure that one day we'll be writing history books hundreds of years from now. This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online  the generation that built something really and truly global. But yes  it's also true that the Internet has problems  very serious problems  problems with security and problems with privacy. I've spent my career fighting these problems. So let me show you something. This here is Brain. This is a floppy disk    five and a quarter inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A. It's the first virus we ever found for PC computers. And we actually know where Brain came from. We know because it says so inside the code. Let's take a look. All right. That's the boot sector of an infected floppy  and if we take a closer look inside  we'll see that right there  it says   Welcome to the dungeon.  And then it continues  saying        Basit and Amjad. And Basit and Amjad are first names  Pakistani first names. In fact  there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan. Now      . Now it's     . That's    years ago. The PC virus problem is    years old now. So half a year ago  I decided to go to Pakistan myself. So let's see  here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan. This is from the city of Lahore  which is around     kilometers south from Abbottabad  where Bin Laden was caught. Here's a typical street view. And here's the street or road leading to this building  which is     Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town. And I knocked on the door. You want to guess who opened the door  Basit and Amjad  they are still there. So here standing up is Basit. Sitting down is his brother Amjad. These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus. Now of course  we had a very interesting discussion. I asked them why. I asked them how they feel about what they started. And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years. So there is some sort of justice in the world after all. Now  the viruses that we used to see in the     s and     s obviously are not a problem any more. So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like. What I'm running here is a system that enables me to run age old programs on a modern computer. So let me just mount some drives. Go over there. What we have here is a list of old viruses. So let me just run some viruses on my computer. For example  let's go with the Centipede virus first. And you can see at the top of the screen  there's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one. You know that you're infected because it actually shows up. Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash  invented in Russia in     . Let me show you one which actually makes some sound. And the last example  guess what the Walker virus does  Yes  there's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected. So it used to be fairly easy to know that you're infected by a virus  when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers. Today  they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers. Today  viruses are a global problem. What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs  where we track virus infections worldwide. So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere. In fact  if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web  we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses  how many new examples of malware we find every single day. Here's the latest virus we've found  in a file called Server.exe. And we found it right over here three seconds ago    the previous one  six seconds ago. And if we just scroll around  it's just massive. We find tens of thousands  even hundreds of thousands. And that's the last    minutes of malware every single day. So where are all these coming from then  Well today  it's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses. It's gangs like    let's go to GangstaBucks.com. This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers. So if you are a virus writer and you're capable of infecting Windows computers  but you don't know what to do with them  you can sell those infected computers    somebody else's computers    to these guys. And they'll actually pay you money for those computers. So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers  Well there's multiple different ways  such as banking trojans  which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking  or keyloggers. Keyloggers silently sit on your computer  hidden from view  and they record everything you type. So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches. Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals. Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals. Same thing with every single password and so on. But the thing that they're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store. Because when you do purchases in online stores  you will be typing in your name  the delivery address  your credit card number and the credit card security codes. And here's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago. That's the credit card number  that's the expiration date  that's the security code  and that's the name of the owner of the card. Once you gain access to other people's credit card information  you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information. And that  obviously  is a problem. We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime. One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations  we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons. We find guys like Bjorn Sundin  originally from Sweden  and his partner in crime  also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages  Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain  a U.S. citizen. These guys were running an operation called I.M.U.  a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions. They are both right now on the run. Nobody knows where they are. U.S. officials  just a couple of weeks ago  froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain  and that bank account had   .  million U.S. dollars on it. So the amount of money online crime generates is significant. And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks. We know that online criminals are hiring programmers  hiring testing people  testing their code  having back end systems with SQL databases. And they can afford to watch how we work    like how security people work    and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build. They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage. I mean  the Internet is international. That's why we call it the Internet. And if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world  here's a video built by Clarified Networks  which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world. This operation  believed to be originally from Estonia  moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down. So you just can't shut these guys down. They will switch from one country to another  from one jurisdiction to another    moving around the world  using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world. Now  criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us. So how do you actually go around finding online criminals  How do you actually track them down  Let me give you an example. What we have here is one exploit file. Here  I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file  which contains an exploit. And that basically means  if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer  it actually takes over your computer and runs code. Now  if you'll take a look at this image file    well there's the image header  and there the actual code of the attack starts. And that code has been encrypted  so let's decrypt it. It has been encrypted with XOR function   . You just have to believe me  it is  it is. And we can go here and actually start decrypting it. Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted. And I know  it doesn't really look much different from the original. But just keep staring at it. You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address  unionseek.com d ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program. And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer. But even more interestingly  if we continue decrypting  we'll find this mysterious string  which says O   KO  RUS. That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature. It's not used for anything. And I was looking at that  trying to figure out what it means. So obviously I Googled for it. I got zero hits  wasn't there. So I spoke with the guys at the lab. And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs  and one of them mentioned  well  it ends in RUS like Russia. And    is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg. For example  you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that. So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg  and through a long road  we eventually found this one particular website. Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website  and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal. And on this blog  he blogs about his life  about his life in St. Petersburg    he's in his early   s    about his cat  about his girlfriend. And he drives a very nice car. In fact  this guy drives a Mercedes Benz S    V   with a six liter engine with more than     horsepower. Now that's a nice car for a    something year old kid in St. Petersburg. How do I know about this car  Because he blogged about the car. He actually had a car accident. In downtown St. Petersburg  he actually crashed his car into another car. And he put blogged images about the car accident    that's his Mercedes    right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into. And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in   RUS. And if you actually take a look at the scene picture  you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O   KO  RUS. Now I'm not a lawyer  but if I would be  this is where I would say   I rest my case.  So what happens when online criminals are caught  Well in most cases it never gets this far. The vast majority of the online crime cases  we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from. And even if we are able to find online criminals  quite often there is no outcome. The local police don't act  or if they do  there's not enough evidence  or for some reason we can't take them down. I wish it would be easier  unfortunately it isn't. But things are also changing at a very rapid pace. You've all heard about things like Stuxnet. So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these. That's a Siemens S      PLC  programmable logic  controller . And this is what runs our infrastructure. This is what runs everything around us. PLC's  these small boxes which have no display  no keyboard  which are programmed  are put in place  and they do their job. For example  the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these. And when Stuxnet infects one of these  that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about. Because everything around us is being run by these. I mean  we have critical infrastructure. You go to any factory  any power plant  any chemical plant  any food processing plant  you look around    everything is being run by computers. Everything is being run by computers. Everything is reliant on these computers working. We have become very reliant on Internet  on basic things like electricity  obviously  on computers working. And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us. We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail. So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren't there. It's actually very basic stuff    thinking about continuity  thinking about backups  thinking about the things that actually matter. Now I told you    I love the Internet. I do. Think about all the services we have online. Think about if they are taken away from you  if one day you don't actually have them for some reason or another. I see beauty in the future of the Internet  but I'm worried that we might not see that. I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime. Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us. I've spent my life defending the Net  and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime  we are running a risk of losing it all. We have to do this globally  and we have to do it right now. What we need is more global  international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs    these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks. That's much more important than running anti viruses or running firewalls. What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks  and even more importantly  we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime  but haven't yet done it. We have to find the people with the skills  but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good. Thank you very much. Embracing otherness. When I first heard this theme  I thought  well  embracing otherness is embracing myself. And the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me  and it's given me an insight into the whole notion of self  which I think is worth sharing with you today. We each have a self  but I don't think that we're born with one. You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything  they're not separate  Well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly. It's like that initial stage is over    oneness  infancy  unformed  primitive. It's no longer valid or real. What is real is separateness  and at some point in early babyhood  the idea of self starts to form. Our little portion of oneness is given a name  is told all kinds of things about itself  and these details  opinions and ideas become facts  which go towards building ourselves  our identity. And that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world. But the self is a projection based on other people's projections. Is it who we really are  Or who we really want to be  or should be  So this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up. The self that I attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again. And my panic at not having a self that fit  and the confusion that came from my self being rejected  created anxiety  shame and hopelessness  which kind of defined me for a long time. But in retrospect  the destruction of my self was so repetitive that I started to see a pattern. The self changed  got affected  broken  destroyed  but another one would evolve    sometimes stronger  sometimes hateful  sometimes not wanting to be there at all. The self was not constant. And how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place  I grew up on the coast of England in the '  s. My dad is white from Cornwall  and my mom is black from Zimbabwe. Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people. But nature had its wicked way  and brown babies were born. But from about the age of five  I was aware that I didn't fit. I was the black atheist kid in the all white Catholic school run by nuns. I was an anomaly  and my self was rooting around for definition and trying to plug in. Because the self likes to fit  to see itself replicated  to belong. That confirms its existence and its importance. And it is important. It has an extremely important function. Without it  we literally can't interface with others. We can't hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity  of success. But my skin color wasn't right. My hair wasn't right. My history wasn't right. My self became defined by otherness  which meant that  in that social world  I didn't really exist. And I was  other  before being anything else    even before being a girl. I was a noticeable nobody. Another world was opening up around this time  performance and dancing. That nagging dread of self hood didn't exist when I was dancing. I'd literally lose myself. And I was a really good dancer. I would put all my emotional expression into my dancing. I could be in the movement in a way that I wasn't able to be in my real life  in myself. And at     I stumbled across another opportunity  and I earned my first acting role in a film. I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting. My dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self  not my own  and it felt so good. It was the first time that I existed inside a fully functioning self    one that I controlled  that I steered  that I gave life to. But the shooting day would end  and I'd return to my gnarly  awkward self. By     I was a fully fledged movie actor  but still searching for definition. I applied to read anthropology at university. Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview  and she asked me   How would you define race   Well  I thought I had the answer to that one  and I said   Skin color.   So biology  genetics   she said.  Because  Thandie  that's not accurate. Because there's actually more genetic difference between a black Kenyan and a black Ugandan than there is between a black Kenyan and  say  a white Norwegian. Because we all stem from Africa. So in Africa  there's been more time to create genetic diversity.  In other words  race has no basis in biological or scientific fact. On the one hand  result. Right  On the other hand  my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility. But what was credible  what is biological and scientific fact  is that we all stem from Africa    in fact  from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve who lived         years ago. And race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance. Strangely  these revelations didn't cure my low self esteem  that feeling of otherness. My desire to disappear was still very powerful. I had a degree from Cambridge  I had a thriving career  but my self was a car crash  and I wound up with bulimia and on a therapist's couch. And of course I did. I still believed my self was all I was. I still valued self worth above all other worth  and what was there to suggest otherwise  We've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self. Look at the industry for self image and the jobs it creates  the revenue it turns over. We'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing. But it's not. It's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death. But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection    and that thing is oneness  our essence. The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator    to you and to me. And that can happen with awareness    awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self hood. For a start  we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves. It happens when I dance  when I'm acting. I'm earthed in my essence  and my self is suspended. In those moments  I'm connected to everything    the ground  the air  the sounds  the energy from the audience. All my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel    that feeling of oneness. And when I'm acting a role  I inhabit another self  and I give it life for awhile  because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment. And I've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to Secretary of State in     . And no matter how other these selves might be  they're all related in me. And I honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure. I always wondered why I could feel others' pain so deeply  why I could recognize the somebody in the nobody. It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way. I thought I lacked substance  and the fact that I could feel others' meant that I had nothing of myself to feel. The thing that was a source of shame was actually a source of enlightenment. And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function  a funny thing happened. I stopped giving it so much authority. I give it its due. I take it to therapy. I've become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior. But I'm not ashamed of my self. In fact  I respect my self and its function. And over time and with practice  I've tried to live more and more from my essence. And if you can do that  incredible things happen. I was in Congo in February  dancing and celebrating with women who've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways    destroyed because other brutalized  psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves' addiction to iPods  Pads  and bling  which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain  their suffering  their death. Because  hey  if we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life  then we're devaluing and desensitizing life. And in that disconnected state  yeah  we can build factory farms with no windows  destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war. So here's a note to self  The cracks have started to show in our constructed world  and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks  and oil and blood  rivers of it. Crucially  we haven't been figuring out how to live in oneness with the Earth and every other living thing. We've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other    billions of each other. Only we're not living with each other  our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection. Let's live with each other and take it a breath at a time. If we can get under that heavy self  light a torch of awareness  and find our essence  our connection to the infinite and every other living thing. We knew it from the day we were born. Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness. It's more a reality than the ones our selves have created. Imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor inevitable death of self  appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next. Simple awareness is where it begins. Thank you for listening. This is a photograph by the artist Michael Najjar  and it's real  in the sense that he went there to Argentina to take the photo. But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that. And what he's done is he's actually reshaped  digitally  all of the contours of the mountains to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index. So what you see  that precipice  that high precipice with the valley  is the      financial crisis. The photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there. I don't know where we are now. This is the Hang Seng index for Hong Kong. And similar topography. I wonder why. And this is art. This is metaphor. But I think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth  and it's with those teeth that I want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math    not just financial math  but math in general. That its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it    the world around us and the world inside us. And it's specifically algorithms  which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff. They acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again  and they ossify and calcify  and they become real. And I was thinking about this  of all places  on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago  because I happened to be seated next to a Hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the Cold War for physicists in Hungary. And I said   So what were you doing   And he said   Well we were mostly breaking stealth.  And I said   That's a good job. That's interesting. How does that work   And to understand that  you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works. And so    this is an over simplification    but basically  it's not like you can just pass a radar signal right through     tons of steel in the sky. It's not just going to disappear. But if you can take this big  massive thing  and you could turn it into a million little things    something like a flock of birds    well then the radar that's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky. And if you're a radar  that's a really bad job. And he said   Yeah.  He said   But that's if you're a radar. So we didn't use a radar  we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals  electronic communication. And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication  we thought  'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'  And I said   Yeah. That's good. So you've effectively negated    years of aeronautic research. What's your act two  What do you do when you grow up   And he said   Well  financial services.  And I said   Oh.  Because those had been in the news lately. And I said   How does that work   And he said   Well there's       physicists on Wall Street now  and I'm one of them.  And I said   What's the black box for Wall Street   And he said   It's funny you ask that  because it's actually called black box trading. And it's also sometimes called algo trading  algorithmic trading.  And algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the United States Air Force had  which is that they're moving these positions    whether it's Proctor   Gamble or Accenture  whatever    they're moving a million shares of something through the market. And if they do that all at once  it's like playing poker and going all in right away. You just tip your hand. And so they have to find a way    and they use algorithms to do this    to break up that big thing into a million little transactions. And the magic and the horror of that is that the same math that you use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what's actually happening in the market. So if you need to have some image of what's happening in the stock market right now  what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide  and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act. And all of that's great  and it's fine. And that's    percent of the United States stock market     percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension  your mortgage. And what could go wrong  What could go wrong is that a year ago  nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes  and they called it the Flash Crash of     . All of a sudden  nine percent just goes away  and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it  nobody asked for it. Nobody had any control over what was actually happening. All they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said   Stop.  And that's the thing  is that we're writing things  we're writing these things that we can no longer read. And we've rendered something illegible  and we've lost the sense of what's actually happening in this world that we've made. And we're starting to make our way. There's a company in Boston called Nanex  and they use math and magic and I don't know what  and they reach into all the market data and they find  actually sometimes  some of these algorithms. And when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies. And they do what we've always done when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand    which is that they give them a name and a story. So this is one that they found  they called the Knife  the Carnival  the Boston Shuffler  Twilight. And the gag is that  of course  these aren't just running through the market. You can find these kinds of things wherever you look  once you learn how to look for them. You can find it here  this book about flies that you may have been looking at on Amazon. You may have noticed it when its price started at  .  million dollars. It's out of print    still ... If you had bought it at  .   it would have been a bargain. A few hours later  it had gone up to   .  million dollars  plus shipping and handling. And the question is  Nobody was buying or selling anything  what was happening  And you see this behavior on Amazon as surely as you see it on Wall Street. And when you see this kind of behavior  what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict  algorithms locked in loops with each other  without any human oversight  without any adult supervision to say   Actually   .  million is plenty.  And as with Amazon  so it is with Netflix. And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years. They started with Cinematch  and they've tried a bunch of others    there's Dinosaur Planet  there's Gravity. They're using Pragmatic Chaos now. Pragmatic Chaos is  like all of Netflix algorithms  trying to do the same thing. It's trying to get a grasp on you  on the firmware inside the human skull  so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next    which is a very  very difficult problem. But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down  it doesn't take away from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has. Pragmatic Chaos  like all Netflix algorithms  determines  in the end     percent of what movies end up being rented. So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for    percent of those movies. But what if you could rate those movies before they get made  Wouldn't that be handy  Well  a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood  and they have  story algorithms     a company called Epagogix. And you can run your script through there  and they can tell you  quantifiably  that that's a    million dollar movie or a     million dollar movie. And the thing is  is that this isn't Google. This isn't information. These aren't financial stats  this is culture. And what you see here  or what you don't really see normally  is that these are the physics of culture. And if these algorithms  like the algorithms on Wall Street  just crashed one day and went awry  how would we know  What would it look like  And they're in your house. They're in your house. These are two algorithms competing for your living room. These are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means. And you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them  and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom. And the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far fetched. It's super real and it's happening around you. You feel it most when you're in a sealed metal box  a new style elevator  they're called destination control elevators. These are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to before you get in the elevator. And it uses what's called a bin packing algorithm. So none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want. Everybody who wants to go to the   th floor goes into car two  and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five. And the problem with that is that people freak out. People panic. And you see why. You see why. It's because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation  like the buttons. Like the things that people use. All it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says   Stop.  And this is what we're designing for. We're designing for this machine dialect. And how far can you take that  How far can you take it  You can take it really  really far. So let me take it back to Wall Street. Because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else  which is speed. And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds. And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are  it takes you         microseconds just to click a mouse. But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're five microseconds behind  you're a loser. So if you were an algorithm  you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper    throwing out all the furniture  all the infrastructure for human use  and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in    all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet. And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system. And of course  it is  but it's distributed from places. In New York  this is where it's distributed from  the Carrier Hotel located on Hudson Street. And this is really where the wires come right up into the city. And the reality is that the further away you are from that  you're a few microseconds behind every time. These guys down on Wall Street  Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation  they're eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the Carrier Hotel. And that's going to keep happening. We're going to keep hollowing them out  because you  inch for inch and pound for pound and dollar for dollar  none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space like the Boston Shuffler could. But if you zoom out  if you zoom out  you would see an     mile trench between New York City and Chicago that's been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks. This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal    times faster than you can click a mouse    just for these algorithms  just for the Carnival and the Knife. And when you think about this  that we're running through the United States with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal three microseconds faster  all for a communications framework that no human will ever know  that's a kind of manifest destiny  and we'll always look for a new frontier. Unfortunately  we have our work cut out for us. This is just theoretical. This is some mathematicians at MIT. And the truth is I don't really understand a lot of what they're talking about. It involves light cones and quantum entanglement  and I don't really understand any of that. But I can read this map  and what this map says is that  if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are  that's where people are  where the cities are  you're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively. And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean. So that's what we'll do  we'll build bubbles or something  or platforms. We'll actually part the water to pull money out of the air  because it's a bright future if you're an algorithm. And it's not the money that's so interesting actually. It's what the money motivates  that we're actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency. And in that light  you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs  and you realize that they're not metaphor  they're prophecy. They're prophecy for the kind of seismic  terrestrial effects of the math that we're making. And the landscape was always made by this sort of weird  uneasy collaboration between nature and man. But now there's this third co evolutionary force  algorithms    the Boston Shuffler  the Carnival. And we will have to understand those as nature  and in a way  they are. Thank you. It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird. Birds are very agile. They fly  not with rotating components  so they fly only by flapping their wings. So we looked at the birds  and we tried to make a model that is powerful  ultralight  and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings. So what would be better than to use the herring gull  in its freedom  circling and swooping over the sea  and to use this as a role model  So we bring a team together. There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics  in the field of building gliders. And the task was to build an ultralight indoor flying model that is able to fly over your heads. So be careful later on. And this was one issue  to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down. So why do we do all this  We are a company in the field of automation  and we'd like to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient  and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena. So I now would like you to put your seat belts on and put your hats on. So maybe we'll try it once    to fly a SmartBird. Thank you. So we can now look at the SmartBird. So here is one without a skin. We have a wingspan of about two meters. The length is one meter and six  and the weight is only     grams. And it is all out of carbon fiber. In the middle we have a motor  and we also have a gear in it  and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor. So within the motor  we have three Hall sensors  so we know exactly where the wing is. And if we now beat up and down    We have the possibility to fly like a bird. So if you go down  you have the large area of propulsion  and if you go up  the wings are not that large  and it is easier to get up. So  the next thing we did  or the challenges we did  was to coordinate this movement. We have to turn it  go up and go down. We have a split wing. With the split wing  we get the lift at the upper wing  and we get the propulsion at the lower wing. Also  we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency. We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency. So therefore  it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion  from    percent up to    percent. Next thing we have to do  we have to control and regulate the whole structure. Only if you control and regulate it  you will get that aerodynamic efficiency. So the overall consumption of energy is about    watts at takeoff and    to    watts in flight. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Markus  we should fly it once more. Markus Fischer  Yeah  sure. The question today is not  Why did we invade Afghanistan  The question is  why are we still in Afghanistan one decade later  Why are we spending      billion  Why have we got         troops on the ground  Why were more people killed last month than in any preceding month of this conflict  How has this happened  The last    years has been the age of intervention  and Afghanistan is simply one act in a five act tragedy. We came out of the end of the Cold War in despair. We faced Rwanda  we faced Bosnia  and then we rediscovered our confidence. In the third act  we went into Bosnia and Kosovo and we seemed to succeed. In the fourth act  with our hubris  our overconfidence developing  we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan  and in the fifth act  we plunged into a humiliating mess. So the question is  What are we doing  Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan  And the answer  of course  that we keep being given is as follows  we're told that we went into Afghanistan because of       and that we remain there because the Taliban poses an existential threat to global security. In the words of President Obama   If the Taliban take over again  they will invite back Al Qaeda  who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.  The story that we're told is that there was a  light footprint  initially    in other words  that we ended up in a situation where we didn't have enough troops  we didn't have enough resources  that Afghans were frustrated    they felt there wasn't enough progress and economic development and security  and therefore the Taliban came back    that we responded in      and      with troop deployments  but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground. And that it wasn't until       when President Obama signed off on a surge  that we finally had  in the words of Secretary Clinton   the strategy  the leadership and the resources.  So  as the president now reassures us  we are on track to achieve our goals. All of this is wrong. Every one of those statements is wrong. Afghanistan does not pose an existential threat to global security. It is extremely unlikely the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country    extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul. They simply don't have a conventional military option. And even if they were able to do so  even if I'm wrong  it's extremely unlikely the Taliban would invite back Al Qaeda. From the Taliban's point of view  that was their number one mistake last time. If they hadn't invited back Al Qaeda  they would still be in power today. And even if I'm wrong about those two things  even if they were able to take back the country  even if they were to invite back Al Qaeda  it's extremely unlikely that Al Qaeda would significantly enhance its ability to harm the United States or harm Europe. Because this isn't the     s anymore. If the Al Qaeda base was to be established near Ghazni  we would hit them very hard  and it would be very  very difficult for the Taliban to protect them. Furthermore  it's simply not true that what went wrong in Afghanistan is the light footprint. In my experience  in fact  the light footprint was extremely helpful. And these troops that we brought in    it's a great picture of David Beckham there on the sub machine gun    made the situation worse  not better. When I walked across Afghanistan in the winter of            what I saw was scenes like this. A girl  if you're lucky  in the corner of a dark room    lucky to be able to look at the Koran. But in those early days when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources  we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan. Within a few months  there were two and a half million more girls in school. In Sangin where I was sick in       the nearest health clinic was within three days walk. Today  there are    health clinics in that area alone. There was amazing improvements. We went from almost no Afghans having mobile telephones during the Taliban to a situation where  almost overnight  three million Afghans had mobile telephones. And we had progress in the free media. We had progress in elections    all of this with the so called light footprint. But when we began to bring more money  when we began to invest more resources  things got worse  not better. How  Well first see  if you put     billion dollars a year into a country like Afghanistan where the entire revenue of the Afghan state is one billion dollars a year  you drown everything. It's not simply corruption and waste that you create  you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government  the elected Afghan government  with the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours with their own priorities. And the same is true for the troops. When I walked across Afghanistan  I stayed with people like this. This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj. Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host. He was very generous  like many of the Afghans I stayed with. But he was also considerably more conservative  considerably more anti foreign  considerably more Islamist than we'd like to acknowledge. This man  for example  Mullah Mustafa  tried to shoot me. And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is I was somewhat frightened  and I was too afraid on this occasion to ask him  having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house  why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me. But    months later  I asked him why he had tried to shoot me. And Mullah Mustafa    he's the man with the pen and paper    explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph  Nadir Shah had bet him that he couldn't hit me. Now this is not to say Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa. It's not  it's a wonderful place full of incredible energy and intelligence. But it is a place where the putting in of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it.       Anthony Fitzherbert  an agricultural engineer  could travel through Helmand  could stay in Nad Ali  Sangin and Ghoresh  which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place. Today  he could never do that. So the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the Taliban insurgency is mistaken. Rather than preceding the insurgency  the Taliban followed the troop deployment  and as far as I'm concerned  the troop deployment caused their return. Now is this a new idea  No  there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years. I ran a center at Harvard from      to       and there were people like Michael Semple there who speak Afghan languages fluently  who've traveled to almost every district in the country. Andrew Wilder  for example  born on the Pakistan Iranian border  served his whole life in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Paul Fishstein who began working there in         worked for Save the Children  ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit. These are people who were able to say consistently that the increase in development aid was making Afghanistan less secure  not more secure    that the counter insurgency strategy was not working and would not work. And yet  nobody listened to them. Instead  there was a litany of astonishing optimism. Beginning in       every general came in saying   I've inherited a dismal situation  but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy  which will deliver   in General Barno's word in       the  decisive year.  Well guess what  It didn't. But it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying that he had the strategy and the resources to deliver  in       the  decisive year.  Or General David Richards to come in      and say he had the strategy and the resources to deliver the  crunch year.  Or in       the Norwegian deputy foreign minister  Espen Eide  to say that that would deliver the  decisive year.  Or in       Major General Champoux to come in and say he would deliver the  decisive year.  Or in       my great friend  General Stanley McChrystal  who said that he was  knee deep in the decisive year.  Or in       the U.K. foreign secretary  David Miliband  who said that at last we would deliver the  decisive year.  And you'll be delighted to hear in       today  that Guido Westerwelle  the German foreign minister  assures us that we are in the  decisive year.  How do we allow any of this to happen  Well the answer  of course  is  if you spend     billion or     billion dollars a year in a country  you co opt almost everybody. Even the aid agencies  who begin to receive an enormous amount of money from the U.S. and the European governments to build schools and clinics  are somewhat disinclined to challenge the idea that Afghanistan is an existential threat to global security. They're worried  in other words  that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat    Oxfam  Save the Children wouldn't get the money to build their hospitals and schools. It's also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest. It's very difficult for a politician  because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain. You feel deep  deep guilt. You exaggerate your fears  and you're terrified about the humiliation of defeat. What is the solution to this  Well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like Michael Semple  or those other people  who are telling the truth  who know the country  who've spent    years on the ground    and most importantly of all  the missing component of this    Afghans themselves  who understand what is going on. We need to somehow get their message to the policymakers. And this is very difficult to do because of our structures. The first thing we need to change is the structures of our government. Very  very sadly  our foreign services  the United Nations  the military in these countries have very little idea of what's going on. The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months  Italian soldiers  on tours of four months  the American military  on tours of    months. Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds. When they go out  they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready    hours in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour. In the British embassy in Afghanistan in       an embassy of     people  there were only three people who could speak Dari  the main language of Afghanistan  at a decent level. And there was not a single Pashto speaker. In the Afghan section in London responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground  I was told last year that there was not a single staff member of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a posting in Afghanistan. So we need to change that institutional culture. And I could make the same points about the United States and the United Nations. Secondly  we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals. We need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious  that we understand that optimism is in the DNA of the military  that we don't respond to it with quite as much alacrity. And thirdly  we need to have some humility. We need to begin from the position that our knowledge  our power  our legitimacy is limited. This doesn't mean that intervention around the world is a disaster. It isn't. Bosnia and Kosovo were signal successes  great successes. Today when you go to Bosnia it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early     s happened. It's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made since     . Refugee return  which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees thought would be extremely unlikely  has largely happened. A million properties have been returned. Borders between the Bosniak territory and the Bosnian Serb territory have calmed down. The national army has shrunk. The crime rates in Bosnia today are lower than they are in Sweden. This has been done by an incredible  principled effort by the international community  and  of course  above all  by Bosnians themselves. But you need to look at context. And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq. You need to understand that in those places what really mattered was  firstly  the role of Tudman and Milosevic in coming to the agreement  and then the fact those men went  that the regional situation improved  that the European Union could offer Bosnia something extraordinary  the chance to be part of a new thing  a new club  a chance to join something bigger. And finally  we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo  a lot of the secret of what we did  a lot of the secret of our success  was our humility    was the tentative nature of our engagement. We criticized people a lot in Bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals. We criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees. But that slowness  that caution  the fact that President Clinton initially said that American troops would only be deployed for a year  turned out to be a strength  and it helped us to put our priorities right. One of the saddest things about our involvement in Afghanistan is that we've got our priorities out of sync. We're not matching our resources to our priorities. Because if what we're interested in is terrorism  Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan. If what we're interested in is regional stability  Egypt is far more important. If what we're worried about is poverty and development  sub Saharan Africa is far more important. This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter  but that it's one of    countries in the world with which we need to engage. So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention  what we need to think of is something like mountain rescue. Why mountain rescue  Because when people talk about intervention  they imagine that some scientific theory    the Rand Corporation goes around counting    previous insurgencies producing mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter insurgent for every    members of the population. This is the wrong way of looking at it. You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue. When you're doing mountain rescue  you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue  you look for somebody who knows the terrain. It's about context. You understand that you can prepare  but the amount of preparation you can do is limited    you can take some water  you can have a map  you can have a pack. But what really matters is two kinds of problems    problems that occur on the mountain which you couldn't anticipate  such as  for example  ice on a slope  but which you can get around  and problems which you couldn't anticipate and which you can't get around  like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche or a change in the weather. And the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain  in every temperature  at every period    a guide who  above all  knows when to turn back  who doesn't press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them. What we look for in firemen  in climbers  in policemen  and what we should look for in intervention  is intelligent risk takers    not people who plunge blind off a cliff  not people who jump into a burning room  but who weigh their risks  weigh their responsibilities. Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option. It makes failure invisible  inconceivable and inevitable. And if we can resist this crazy slogan  we shall discover    in Egypt  in Syria  in Libya  and anywhere else we go in the world    that if we can often do much less than we pretend  we can do much more than we fear. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Rory  you mentioned Libya at the end. Just briefly  what's your take on the current events there and the intervention  Rory Stewart  Okay  I think Libya poses the classic problem. The problem in Libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white. We imagine there are only two choices  either full engagement and troop deployment or total isolation. And we are always being tempted up to our neck. We put our toes in and we go up to our neck. What we should have done in Libya is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution. We should have limited ourselves very  very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi. We could have done that. We set up a no fly zone within    hours because Gaddafi had no planes within    hours. Instead of which  we've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change. In doing so  we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council  which means it's very difficult to get a resolution on Syria  and we're setting ourselves up again for failure. Once more  humility  limits  honesty  realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of. BG  Rory  thank you very much. RS  Thank you.  BG  Thank you.  Cities are the crucible of civilization. They have been expanding  urbanization has been expanding  at an exponential rate in the last     years so that by the second part of this century  the planet will be completely dominated by cities. Cities are the origins of global warming  impact on the environment  health  pollution  disease  finance  economies  energy    they're all problems that are confronted by having cities. That's where all these problems come from. And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet. Here's some numbers. Two hundred years ago  the United States was less than a few percent urbanized. It's now more than    percent. The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago. China's building     new cities in the next    years. Now listen to this  Every week for the foreseeable future  until       every week more than a million people are being added to our cities. This is going to affect everything. Everybody in this room  if you stay alive  is going to be affected by what's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon. However  cities  despite having this negative aspect to them  are also the solution. Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people  creating ideas  innovation  wealth and so on. So we have this kind of dual nature. And so there's an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities. Now these are my comrades in arms. This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people  and they've done all the work  and I'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together. So here's the problem  This is what we all want. The    billion people on the planet in      want to live in places like this  having things like this  doing things like this  with economies that are growing like this  not realizing that entropy produces things like this  this  this and this. And the question is  Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York are going to look like in       or is it going to be this  That's the question. I must say  many of the indicators look like this is what it's going to look like  but let's talk about it. So my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities. And scientific theory means quantifiable    relying on underlying generic principles that can be made into a predictive framework. That's the quest. Is that conceivable  Are there universal laws  So here's two questions that I have in my head when I think about this problem. The first is  Are cities part of biology  Is London a great big whale  Is Edinburgh a horse  Is Microsoft a great big anthill  What do we learn from that  We use them metaphorically    the DNA of a company  the metabolism of a city  and so on    is that just bullshit  metaphorical bullshit  or is there serious substance to it  And if that is the case  how come that it's very hard to kill a city  You could drop an atom bomb on a city  and    years later it's surviving. Very few cities fail. All companies die  all companies. And if you have a serious theory  you should be able to predict when Google is going to go bust. So is that just another version of this  Well we understand this very well. That is  you ask any generic question about this    how many trees of a given size  how many branches of a given size does a tree have  how many leaves  what is the energy flowing through each branch  what is the size of the canopy  what is its growth  what is its mortality  We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions. And the idea is can we do the same for this  So the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life  is that it is scalable  it works over an extraordinary range. This is just a tiny range actually  It's us mammals  we're one of these. The same principles  the same dynamics  the same organization is at work in all of these  including us  and it can scale over a range of     million in size. And that is one of the main reasons life is so resilient and robust    scalability. We're going to discuss that in a moment more. But you know  at a local level  you scale  everybody in this room is scaled. That's called growth. Here's how you grew. Rat  that's a rat    could have been you. We're all pretty much the same. And you see  you're very familiar with this. You grow very quickly and then you stop. And that line there is a prediction from the same theory  based on the same principles  that describes that forest. And here it is for the growth of a rat  and those points on there are data points. This is just the weight versus the age. And you see  it stops growing. Very  very good for biology    also one of the reasons for its great resilience. Very  very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm. This is what we believe. This is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us  particularly illustrated in that left hand corner  hockey sticks. This is a bunch of software companies    and what it is is their revenue versus their age    all zooming away  and everybody making millions and billions of dollars. Okay  so how do we understand this  So let's first talk about biology. This is explicitly showing you how things scale  and this is a truly remarkable graph. What is plotted here is metabolic rate    how much energy you need per day to stay alive    versus your weight  your mass  for all of us bunch of organisms. And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of     otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph. And what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line. Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe  there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this. It's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms  each subsystem  each cell type  each gene  has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history. And yet  despite all of that Darwinian evolution and natural selection  they've been constrained to lie on a line. Something else is going on. Before I talk about that  I've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve  this straight line. It's three quarters  roughly  which is less than one    and we call that sublinear. And here's the point of that. It says that  if it were linear  the steepest slope  then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy. But it's sublinear  and what that translates into is that  if you double the size of the organism  you actually only need    percent more energy. So a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale. The bigger you are systematically  according to very well defined rules  less energy per capita. Now any physiological variable you can think of  any life history event you can think of  if you plot it this way  looks like this. There is an extraordinary regularity. So you tell me the size of a mammal  I can tell you at the    percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology  life history  etc. And the reason for this is because of networks. All of life is controlled by networks    from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level. And you're very familiar with these networks. That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant. And here's the summary of what I'm saying. If you take those networks  this idea of networks  and you apply universal principles  mathematizable  universal principles  all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow  including the description of the forest  the description of your circulatory system  the description within cells. One of the things I did not stress in that introduction was that  systematically  the pace of life decreases as you get bigger. Heart rates are slower  you live longer  diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower  etc. The question is  Is any of this true for cities and companies  So is London a scaled up Birmingham  which is a scaled up Brighton  etc.  etc.  Is New York a scaled up San Francisco  which is a scaled up Santa Fe  Don't know. We will discuss that. But they are networks  and the most important network of cities is you. Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions  our interactions  and the clustering and grouping of individuals. Here's just a symbolic picture of that. And here's scaling of cities. This shows that in this very simple example  which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size    plotted in the same way as the biology    you see exactly the same kind of thing. There is a scaling. That is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size. The slope of that is less than linear. There is an economy of scale. Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are    not surprising. But here's what's surprising. It scales in the same way everywhere. This is just European countries  but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia  always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree. And any infrastructure you look at    whether it's the length of roads  length of electrical lines    anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way. It's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on. But even more surprising is if you look at socio economic quantities  quantities that have no analog in biology  that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to        years ago. The top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way. And the bottom one is you lot    super creatives plotted in the same way. And what you see is a scaling phenomenon. But most important in this  the exponent  the analog to that three quarters for the metabolic rate  is bigger than one    it's about  .   to  . . Here it is  which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita  unlike biology    higher wages  more super creative people per capita as you get bigger  more patents per capita  more crime per capita. And we've looked at everything  more AIDS cases  flu  etc. And here  they're all plotted together. Just to show you what we plotted  here is income  GDP    GDP of the city    crime and patents all on one graph. And you can see  they all follow the same line. And here's the statement. If you double the size of a city from         to          from a million to two million     to    million  it doesn't matter  then systematically you get a    percent increase in wages  wealth  number of AIDS cases  number of police  anything you can think of. It goes up by    percent  and you have a    percent savings on the infrastructure. This  no doubt  is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities. Because they think that all those wonderful things    like creative people  wealth  income    is what attracts them  forgetting about the ugly and the bad. What is the reason for this  Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics  but underlying this is the social networks  because this is a universal phenomenon. This    percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet    Japan  Chile  Portugal  Scotland  doesn't matter. Always  all the data shows it's the same  despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently. Something universal is going on. The universality  to repeat  is us    that we are the city. And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions. So there it is  I've said it again. So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure  unlike biology  which had sublinear scaling  economies of scale  you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger. If it's social networks with super linear scaling    more per capita    then the theory says that you increase the pace of life. The bigger you are  life gets faster. On the left is the heart rate showing biology. On the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of European cities  showing that increase. Lastly  I want to talk about growth. This is what we had in biology  just to repeat. Economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior. You grow fast and then stop    part of our resilience. That would be bad for economies and cities. And indeed  one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation  then indeed you get  from the same theory  a beautiful rising exponential curve    lovely. And in fact  if you compare it to data  it fits very well with the development of cities and economies. But it has a terrible catch  and the catch is that this system is destined to collapse. And it's destined to collapse for many reasons    kind of Malthusian reasons    that you run out of resources. And how do you avoid that  Well we've done it before. What we do is  as we grow and we approach the collapse  a major innovation takes place and we start over again  and we start over again as we approach the next one  and so on. So there's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse. The catch  however  to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster. So the image is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster  but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster. We have to accelerate on a continuous basis. And the question is  Can we  as socio economic beings  avoid a heart attack  So lastly  I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies. See companies  they scale. The top one  in fact  is Walmart on the right. It's the same plot. This happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees. We could use sales  anything you like. There it is  after some little fluctuations at the beginning  when companies are innovating  they scale beautifully. And we've looked at        companies in the United States  may I say. And I'm only showing you a little bit of this. What is astonishing about companies is that they scale sublinearly like biology  indicating that they're dominated  not by super linear innovation and ideas  they become dominated by economies of scale. In that interpretation  by bureaucracy and administration  and they do it beautifully  may I say. So if you tell me the size of some company  some small company  I could have predicted the size of Walmart. If it has this sublinear scaling  the theory says we should have sigmoidal growth. There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal. That's what we like  hockey sticks. But you notice  I've cheated  because I've only gone up to '  . Let's go up to     . That red line is from the theory. So if I'd have done this in       I could have predicted what Walmart would be now. And then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies. There they are. That's        companies. They all start looking like hockey sticks  they all bend over  and they all die like you and me. Thank you. I'm going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life. But I want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man. This is Hermann Goering. Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II  his designated successor. And like Hitler  Goering fancied himself a collector of art. He went through Europe  through World War II  stealing  extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection. And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer. Hitler had two of them  and he didn't have any. So he finally found an art dealer  a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren  who sold him a wonderful Vermeer for the cost of what would now be    million dollars. And it was his favorite artwork ever. World War II came to an end  and Goering was captured  tried at Nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death. Then the Allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him. And at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam and arrested Van Meegeren. Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason  which is itself punishable by death. Six weeks into his prison sentence  van Meegeren confessed. But he didn't confess to treason. He said   I did not sell a great masterpiece to that Nazi. I painted it myself  I'm a forger.  Now nobody believed him. And he said   I'll prove it. Bring me a canvas and some paint  and I will paint a Vermeer much better than I sold that disgusting Nazi. I also need alcohol and morphine  because it's the only way I can work.  So they brought him in. He painted a beautiful Vermeer. And then the charges of treason were dropped. He had a lesser charge of forgery  got a year sentence and died a hero to the Dutch people. There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren  but I want to turn now to Goering  who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg. Now Goering was  by all accounts  a terrible man. Even for a Nazi  he was a terrible man. His American interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath. But you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery. According to his biographer   He looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world.  And he killed himself soon afterwards. He had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that. It looked the same  but it had a different origin  it was a different artwork. It wasn't just him who was in for a shock. Once van Meegeren was on trial  he couldn't stop talking. And he boasted about all the great masterpieces that he himself had painted that were attributed to other artists. In particular   The Supper at Emmaus  which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece  his best work    people would come  from  all over the world to see it    was actually a forgery. It was not that painting  but that painting. And when that was discovered  it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum. Why does this matter  I'm a psychologists    why do origins matter so much  Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from  Well there's an answer that many people would give. Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs  because we're focused on status. Among other things  if you want to show off how rich you are  how powerful you are  it's always better to own an original than a forgery because there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries. I don't doubt that that plays some role  but what I want to convince you of today is that there's something else going on. I want to convince you that humans are  to some extent  natural born essentialists. What I mean by this is we don't just respond to things as we see them  or feel them  or hear them. Rather  our response is conditioned on our beliefs  about what they really are  what they came from  what they're made of  what their hidden nature is. I want to suggest that this is true  not just for how we think about things  but how we react to things. So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep    and that this isn't true just for higher level pleasures like art  but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences. So take food. Would you eat this  Well  a good answer is   It depends. What is it   Some of you would eat it if it's pork  but not beef. Some of you would eat it if it's beef  but not pork. Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human. Some of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu. That's not so surprising. But what's more interesting is how it tastes to you will depend critically on what you think you're eating. So one demonstration of this was done with young children. How do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk  but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk    to think they taste better  It's simple  you tell them they're from McDonald's. They believe McDonald's food is tastier  and it leads them to experience it as tastier. How do you get adults to really enjoy wine  It's very simple  pour it from an expensive bottle. There are now dozens  perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff  it tastes better to you. This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist. They get people into a fMRI scanner  and while they're lying there  through a tube  they get to sip wine. In front of them on a screen is information about the wine. Everybody  of course  drinks exactly the same wine. But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff  parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree. It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable  you say you like it more  you really experience it in a different way. Or take sex. These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies. And if you simply show people these pictures  they'll say these are fairly attractive people. But how attractive you find them  how sexually or romantically moved you are by them  rests critically on who you think you're looking at. You probably think the picture on the left is male  the one on the right is female. If that belief turns out to be mistaken  it will make a difference. It will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are. It will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you're looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter  your mother or father. Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido. Maybe one of the most heartening findings from the psychology of pleasure is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance. If you like somebody  they look better to you. This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do. A particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome. So Capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion. Sufferers of Capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates. Now often  a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic. People have murdered those that they loved  believing that they were murdering an imposter. But there's at least one case where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending. This was recorded in     .  Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover.  But that was before she got Capgras syndrome. After she got it   She was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich  virile  handsome and aristocratic.  Of course  it was the same man  but she was seeing him in different ways. As a third example  consider consumer products. So one reason why you might like something is its utility. You can put shoes on your feet  you can play golf with golf clubs  and chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you. But each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history. The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy and sold for three quarters of a million dollars at auction. The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars. And in fact  there's a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people. The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all. According to an unconfirmed report  a Saudi millionaire offered    million dollars for this pair of shoes. They were the ones thrown at George Bush at an Iraqi press conference several years ago. Now this attraction to objects doesn't just work for celebrity objects. Each one of us  most people  have something in our life that's literally irreplaceable  in that it has value because of its history    maybe your wedding ring  maybe your child's baby shoes    so that if it was lost  you couldn't get it back. You could get something that looked like it or felt like it  but you couldn't get the same object back. With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck  we've looked to see what sort of factors  what sort of history  matters for the objects that people like. So in one of our experiments  we asked people to name a famous person who they adored  a living person they adored. So one answer was George Clooney. Then we asked them   How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater   And the answer is a fair amount    more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore. Then we asked other groups of subjects    we gave them different restrictions and different conditions. So for instance  we told some people   Look  you can buy the sweater  but you can't tell anybody you own it  and you can't resell it.  That drops the value of it  suggesting that that's one reason why we like it. But what really causes an effect is you tell people   Look  you could resell it  you could boast about it  but before it gets to you  it's thoroughly washed.  That causes a huge drop in the value. As my wife put it   You've washed away the Clooney cooties.  So let's go back to art. I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall. If people want to get me something at the end of the conference  you could buy me a Chagall. But I don't want a duplicate  even if I can't tell the difference. That's not because  or it's not simply because  I'm a snob and want to boast about having an original. Rather  it's because I want something that has a specific history. In the case of artwork  the history is special indeed. The philosopher Denis Dutton in his wonderful book  The Art Instinct  makes the case that   The value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation.  And that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery. They may look alike  but they have a different history. The original is typically the product of a creative act  the forgery isn't. I think this approach can explain differences in people's taste in art. This is a work by Jackson Pollock. Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock  Okay. Who here  it does nothing for them  They just don't like it. I'm not going to make a claim about who's right  but I will make an empirical claim about people's intuitions  which is that  if you like the work of Jackson Pollock  you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it to believe that these works are difficult to create  that they require a lot of time and energy and creative energy. I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example because there's a young American artist who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock  and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars    in large part because she's a very young artist. This is Marla Olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old. The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program    Minutes II into their house to film her painting. And they then reported that her father was coaching her. When this came out on television  the value of her art dropped to nothing. It was the same art  physically  but the history had changed. I've been focusing now on the visual arts  but I want to give two examples from music. This is Joshua Bell  a very famous violinist. And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment. The question is  How much would people like Joshua Bell  the music of Joshua Bell  if they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell  So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington D.C. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make. And here's a brief clip of this. After being there for three quarters of an hour  he made    dollars. Not bad. It's also not good. Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell  you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell. He actually made    dollars more than that  but he didn't count it. Because this woman comes up    you see at the end of the video    she comes up. She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before at this extravagant black tie affair. So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station. So she's struck with pity. She reaches into her purse and hands him a   . The second example from music is from John Cage's modernist composition    '   .  As many of you know  this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench  opens up the piano and sits and does nothing for four minutes and    seconds    that period of silence. And people have different views on this. But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes. For a dollar     you can listen to that silence  which is different than other forms of silence. Now I've been talking so far about pleasure  but what I want to suggest is that everything I've said applies as well to pain. And how you think about what you're experiencing  your beliefs about the essence of it  affect how it hurts. One lovely experiment was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner. What they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates to an electric shock machine. And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks. So it was a series of five painful shocks. Half of them are told that they're being given the shocks by somebody in another room  but the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks. There's no malevolence  they're just pressing a button. The first shock is recorded as very painful. The second shock feels less painful  because you get a bit used to it. The third drops  the fourth  the fifth. The pain gets less. In the other condition  they're told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose    knows they're shocking them. The first shock hurts like hell. The second shock hurts just as much  and the third and the fourth and the fifth. It hurts more if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose. The most extreme example of this is that in some cases  pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure. Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property that will often seek out low level doses of pain in controlled circumstances and take pleasure from it    as in the eating of hot chili peppers and roller coaster rides. The point was nicely summarized by the poet John Milton who wrote   The mind is its own place  and in itself can make a heaven of hell  a hell of heaven.  And I'll end with that. Thank you. Well after many years working in trade and economics  four years ago  I found myself working on the front lines of human vulnerability. And I found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can't even obtain a meal. This red cup comes from Rwanda from a child named Fabian. And I carry this around as a symbol  really  of the challenge and also the hope. Because one cup of food a day changes Fabian's life completely. But what I'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning  about a billion people on Earth    or one out of every seven    woke up and didn't even know how to fill this cup. One out of every seven people. First  I'll ask you  Why should you care  Why should we care  For most people  if they think about hunger  they don't have to go far back on their own family history    maybe in their own lives  or their parents' lives  or their grandparents' lives    to remember an experience of hunger. I rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience. Some are driven by compassion  feel it's perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity. As Gandhi said   To a hungry man  a piece of bread is the face of God.  Others worry about peace and security  stability in the world. We saw the food riots in       after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight. The destabilizing effects of hunger are known throughout human history. One of the most fundamental acts of civilization is to ensure people can get enough food. Others think about Malthusian nightmares. Will we be able to feed a population that will be nine billion in just a few decades  This is not a negotiable thing  hunger. People have to eat. There's going to be a lot of people. This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain. But I actually came to this issue in a different way. This is a picture of me and my three children. In       I was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her when an image very similar to this came on the television. And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia. One two years earlier had killed more than a million people. But it never struck me as it did that moment  because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby  and she had no milk to nurse. And the baby's cry really penetrated me  as a mother. And I thought  there's nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned with food    the most fundamental expectation of every human being. And it was at that moment that I just was filled with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem. This isn't one of those rare diseases that we don't have the solution for. We know how to fix hunger. A hundred years ago  we didn't. We actually have the technology and systems. And I was just struck that this is out of place. At our time in history  these images are out of place. Well guess what  This is last week in northern Kenya. Yet again  the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day. In fact  what we know now is that every    seconds we lose a child to hunger. This is more than HIV AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis combined. And we know that the issue is not just production of food. One of my mentors in life was Norman Borlaug  my hero. But today I'm going to talk about access to food  because actually this year and last year and during the      food crisis  there was enough food on Earth for everyone to have       kilocalories. So why is it that we have a billion people who can't find food  And I also want to talk about what I call our new burden of knowledge. In       Lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days    from conception to two years old    does not have adequate nutrition  the damage is irreversible. Their brains and bodies will be stunted. And here you see a brain scan of two children    one who had adequate nutrition  another  neglected and who was deeply malnourished. And we can see brain volumes up to    percent less in these children. And in this slide you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain don't form. And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies  which I'll talk about later. But also the earning potential of these children is cut in half in their lifetime due to the stunting that happens in early years. So this burden of knowledge drives me. Because actually we know how to fix it very simply. And yet  in many places  a third of the children  by the time they're three already are facing a life of hardship due to this. I'd like to talk about some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger  some of the things I've learned in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector. I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is. Well first  I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth  breastfeeding. You may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every    seconds if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life. But in Niger  for example  less than seven percent of the children are breastfed for the first six months of life  exclusively. In Mauritania  less than three percent. This is something that can be transformed with knowledge. This message  this word  can come out that this is not an old fashioned way of doing business  it's a brilliant way of saving your child's life. And so today we focus on not just passing out food  but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment  and teaching them about breastfeeding. The second thing I'd like to talk about  If you were living in a remote village somewhere  your child was limp  and you were in a drought  or you were in floods  or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet  what would you do  Do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars  like we can  and pick the right one to match  Well I find parents out on the front lines very aware their children are going down for the count. And I go to those shops  if there are any  or out to the fields to see what they can get  and they cannot obtain the nutrition. Even if they know what they need to do  it's not available. And I'm very excited about this  because one thing we're working on is transforming the technologies that are very available in the food industry to be available for traditional crops. And this is made with chickpeas  dried milk and a host of vitamins  matched to exactly what the brain needs. It costs    cents for us to produce this as  what I call  food for humanity. We did this with food technologists in India and Pakistan    really about three of them. But this is transforming    percent of the kids who get this. One package     cents a day    their malnutrition is overcome. So I am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods. And this is climate proof. It doesn't need to be refrigerated  it doesn't need water  which is often lacking. And these types of technologies  I see  have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition  malnutrition out on the front lines. The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding. Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net. When disaster strikes    the economy gets blown  people lose a job  floods  war  conflict  bad governance  all of those things    there is nothing to fall back on. And usually the institutions    churches  temples  other things    do not have the resources to provide a safety net. What we have found working with the World Bank is that the poor man's safety net  the best investment  is school feeding. And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers  you have a transformative effect. Many kids in the world can't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal. But when that food is there  it's transformative. It costs less than    cents a day to change a kid's life. But what is most amazing is the effect on girls. In countries where girls don't go to school and you offer a meal to girls in school  we see enrollment rates about    percent girls and boys. We see a transformation in attendance by girls. And there was no argument  because it's incentive. Families need the help. And we find that if we keep girls in school later  they'll stay in school until they're     and won't get married if there's food in school. Or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week    it costs about    cents    will keep a girl in school  and they'll give birth to a healthier child  because the malnutrition is sent generation to generation. We know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger. We know this. Right now on the Horn of Africa  we've been through this before. So is this a hopeless cause  Absolutely not. I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope. Cameroon  northern Cameroon  boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades. Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons. Well two years ago  we decided  let's transform the model of fighting hunger  and instead of giving out the food aid  we put it into food banks. And we said  listen  during the lean season  take the food out. You manage  the village manages these warehouses. And during harvest  put it back with interest  food interest. So add in five percent     percent more food. For the past two years      of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid    they're self sufficient. And the food banks are growing. And they're starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village. But they've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources. I love this idea that came from the village level  three keys to unlock that warehouse. Food is gold there. And simple ideas can transform the face  not of small areas  of big areas of the world. I'd like to talk about what I call digital food. Technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine. Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize for saying   Guess what  famines happen in the presence of food because people have no ability to buy it.  We certainly saw that in     . We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa where food prices are up     percent in some areas over last year. Food can be there and people can't buy it. Well this picture    I was in Hebron in a small shop  this shop  where instead of bringing in food  we provide digital food  a card. It says  bon appetit  in Arabic. And the women can go in and swipe and get nine food items. They have to be nutritious  and they have to be locally produced. And what's happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry    where this card's used for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus    the dairy industry has gone up    percent. The shopkeepers are hiring more people. It is a win win win situation that starts the food economy moving. We now deliver food in over    countries over cell phones  transforming even the presence of refugees in countries  and other ways. Perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that Bill Gates  Howard Buffett and others have supported boldly  which is to ask the question  What if  instead of looking at the hungry as victims    and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families    what if we view them as the solution  as the value chain to fight hunger  What if from the women in Africa who cannot sell any food    there's no roads  there's no warehouses  there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with    what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children elsewhere  And Purchasing for Progress today is in    countries. And guess what  In virtually every case  when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market    if you say   We will buy     metric tons of this. We'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly.     their yields have gone up two   three   fourfold and they figure it out  because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life. And we're seeing people transform their lives. Today  food aid  our food aid    huge engine       percent of it is bought in the developing world. Total transformation that can actually transform the very lives that need the food. Now you'd ask  can this be done at scale  These are great ideas  village level ideas. Well I'd like to talk about Brazil  because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years  when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger faster than any nation on Earth right now. And what I've found is  rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things  they invested in a school feeding program. And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity. And they're doing this at huge scale after President Lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day. And this zero hunger program costs .  percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty. It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil  and it's at scale  and it's creating opportunities. I've gone out there  I've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this. Now if we look at the economic imperative here  this isn't just about compassion. The fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger    the cost to society  the burden it has to bear    is on average six percent  and in some countries up to    percent  of GDP a year. And if you look at the    countries with the highest burden of malnutrition  that's     billion lost from a productive economy every year. Well  the World Bank estimates it would take about    billion dollars      .     to address malnutrition in those countries. You look at the cost benefit analysis  and my dream is to take this issue  not just from the compassion argument  but to the finance ministers of the world  and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate  affordable nutrition for all of humanity. The amazing thing I've found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader. When a leader says   Not under my watch   everything begins to change. And the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this. And the fact that France has put food at the center of the G   is really important. Because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person  nation by nation. We have to stand together. And we're seeing nations in Africa. WFP's been able to leave    nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations. What I would like to offer here is a challenge. I believe we're living at a time in human history where it's just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don't know where to find a cup of food. Not only that  transforming hunger is an opportunity  but I think we have to change our mindsets. I am so honored to be here with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers. And I would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say   No more. No more are we going to accept this.  And we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted  but that exists no more. Thank you. We are losing our listening. We spend roughly    percent of our communication time listening  but we're not very good at it. We retain just    percent of what we hear. Now not you  not this talk  but that is generally true. Let's define listening as making meaning from sound. It's a mental process  and it's a process of extraction. We use some pretty cool techniques to do this. One of them is pattern recognition. if I say   David  Sara  pay attention   some of you just sat up. We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal  and especially our name. Differencing is another technique we use. If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes  you would literally cease to hear it. We listen to differences  we discount sounds that remain the same. And then there is a whole range of filters. These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to. Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters. But they actually create our reality in a way  because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now. Give you one example of that  Intention is very important in sound  in listening. When I married my wife  I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time. Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis. But it's a great intention to have in a relationship. But that's not all. Sound places us in space and in time. If you close your eyes right now in this room  you're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces. And you're aware of how many people are around you because of the micro noises you're receiving. And sound places us in time as well  because sound always has time embedded in it. In fact  I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future. So   Sonority is time and meaning     a great quote. I said at the beginning  we're losing our listening. Why did I say that  Well there are a lot of reasons for this. First of all  we invented ways of recording    first writing  then audio recording and now video recording as well. The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared. Secondly  the world is now so noisy  visually and auditorily  it's just hard to listen  it's tiring to listen. Many people take refuge in headphones  but they turn big  public spaces like this  shared soundscapes  into millions of tiny  little personal sound bubbles. In this scenario  nobody's listening to anybody. We're becoming impatient. We don't want oratory anymore  we want sound bites. And the art of conversation is being replaced    dangerously  I think    by personal broadcasting. I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation  which is sadly very common  especially in the U.K. We're becoming desensitized. Our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention. And that means it's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet  the subtle  the understated. This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening. This is not trivial. Because listening is our access to understanding. Conscious listening always creates understanding. And only without conscious listening can these things happen    a world where we don't listen to each other at all  is a very scary place indeed. So I'd like to share with you five simple exercises  tools you can take away with you  to improve your own conscious listening. Would you like that  The first one is silence. Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again. If you can't get absolute silence  go for quiet  that's absolutely fine. Second  I call this the mixer. and we all spend a lot of time in places like this    listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear  How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to  You can do it in a beautiful place as well  like in a lake. How many birds am I hearing  Where are they  Where are those ripples  It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening. Third  this exercise I call savoring  and this is a beautiful exercise. It's about enjoying mundane sounds. This  for example  is my tumble dryer. One  two  three. One  two  three. One  two  three. I love it. Or just try this one on for size. Wow  So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention. I call that the hidden choir. It's around us all the time. The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these  if you just take one thing away. This is listening positions    the idea that you can move your listening position to what's appropriate to what you're listening to. This is playing with those filters. Do you remember  I gave you those filters at the beginning. It's starting to play with them as levers  to get conscious about them and to move to different places. These are just some of the listening positions  or scales of listening positions  that you can use. There are many. Have fun with that. It's very exciting. And finally  an acronym. You can use this in listening  in communication. If you're in any one of those roles    and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk    the acronym is RASA  which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence. And RASA stands for Receive  which means pay attention to the person  Appreciate  making little noises like  hmm    oh    okay   Summarize  the word  so  is very important in communication  and Ask  ask questions afterward. Now sound is my passion  it's my life. I wrote a whole book about it. So I live to listen. That's too much to ask from most people. But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully    connected in space and in time to the physical world around us  connected in understanding to each other  not to mention spiritually connected  because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart. That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill. Why is it not taught  It's crazy. And if we can teach listening in our schools  we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous  scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time    or at least capable of doing it. Now I don't know how to do that  but this is TED  and I think the TED community is capable of anything. So I invite you to connect with me  connect with each other  take this mission out and let's get listening taught in schools  and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world    a world of connection  a world of understanding and a world of peace. Thank you for listening to me today.
