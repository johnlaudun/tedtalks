How many of you have been to Oklahoma City  Raise your hand. Yeah  How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City and have no idea who I am   Laughter  Most of you. Let me give you a little bit of background. Oklahoma City started in the most unique way imaginable. Back on a spring day in       the federal government held what they called a land run. They literally lined up the settlers along an imaginary line  and they fired off a gun  and the settlers roared across the countryside and put down a stake  and wherever they put down that stake  that was their new home. And at the end of the very first day  the population of Oklahoma City had gone from zero to         and our planning department is still paying for that. The citizens got together on that first day and elected a mayor. And then they shot him. That's not really all that funny     Laughter     but it allows me to see what type of audience I'm dealing with  so I appreciate the feedback. The   th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City. Our economy was based on commodities  so the price of cotton or the price of wheat  and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas. And along the way  we became a city of innovation. The shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City. The parking meter  invented in Oklahoma City. You're welcome. Having an economy  though  that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs  and that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history. In the     s  when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat  our economy was soaring  and then in the early     s  it cratered quickly. The price of energy dropped. Our banks began to fail. Before the end of the decade      banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma. There was no bailout on the horizon. Our banking industry  our oil and gas industry  our commercial real estate industry  were all at the bottom of the economic scale. Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves for Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo  anywhere where they could  find a job that measured up to their educational attainment  because in Oklahoma City  the good jobs just weren't there. But along at the end of the '  s came an enterprising businessman who became mayor named Ron Norick. Ron Norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development wasn't incentivizing companies up front  it was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate  and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS that basically was a penny on the dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff. It built a new sports arena  a new canal downtown  it fixed up our performing arts center  a new baseball stadium downtown  a lot of things to improve the quality of life. And the economy indeed seemed to start showing some signs of life. The next mayor came along. He started MAPS for Kids  rebuilt the entire inner city school system  all    buildings either built anew or refurbished. And then  in       in this rare collective lack of judgment bordering on civil disobedience  the citizens elected me mayor. Now the city I inherited was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy  and for the very first time  we started showing up on the lists. Now you know the lists I'm talking about. The media and the Internet love to rank cities. And in Oklahoma City  we'd never really been on lists before. So I thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there. We weren't anywhere close to the top  but we were on the list  we were somebody. Best city to get a job  best city to start a business  best downtown    Oklahoma City. And then came the list of the most obese cities in the country. And there we were. Now I like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places. Dallas and Houston and New Orleans and Atlanta and Miami. You know  these are cities that  typically  you're not embarrassed to be associated with. But nonetheless  I didn't like being on the list. And about that time  I got on the scales. And I weighed     pounds. And then I went to this website sponsored by the federal government  and I typed in my height  I typed in my weight  and I pushed Enter  and it came back and said  obese.  I thought   What a stupid website.   I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese.  And then I started getting honest with myself about what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity  and I noticed this pattern  that I was gaining about two or three pounds a year  and then about every    years  I'd drop    or    pounds. And then I'd do it again. And I had this huge closet full of clothes  and I could only wear a third of it at any one time  and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear. But it all seemed fairly normal  going through it. Well  I finally decided I needed to lose weight  and I knew I could because I'd done it so many times before  so I simply stopped eating as much. I had always exercised. That really wasn't the part of the equation that I needed to work on. But I had been eating       calories a day  and I cut it to       calories a day  and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week for about    weeks. Along the way  though  I started examining my city  its culture  its infrastructure  trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity. And I came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car. But if you happen to be a person  you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn. Our city is very spread out. We have a great intersection of highways  I mean  literally no traffic congestion in Oklahoma City to speak of. And so people live far  far away. Our city limits are enormous      square miles  but    miles is less than    minutes. You literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in Oklahoma City. And as a result  people tend to spread out. Land's cheap. We had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments  for a long  long time. We had fixed that  but it had been relatively recently  and there were literally         or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had  virtually no level of walkability. And as I tried to examine how we might deal with obesity  and was taking all of these elements into my mind  I decided that the first thing we need to do was have a conversation. You see  in Oklahoma City  we weren't talking about obesity. And so  on New Year's Eve of       I went to the zoo  and I stood in front of the elephants  and I said   This city is going on a diet  and we're going to lose a million pounds.  Well  that's when all hell broke loose. The national media gravitated toward this story immediately  and they really could have  gone with it one of two ways. They could have said   This city is so fat that the mayor had to put them on a diet.  But fortunately  the consensus was   Look  this is a problem in a lot of places. This is a city that's wanting to do something about it.  And so they started helping us drive traffic to the website. Now  the web address was thiscityisgoingonadiet.com. And I appeared on  The Ellen DeGeneres Show  one weekday morning to talk about the initiative  and on that day          visits were placed to our website. People were signing up  and so the pounds started to add up  and the conversation that I thought was so important to have was starting to take place. It was taking place inside the homes  mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids. It was taking place in churches. Churches were starting their own running groups and their own support groups for people who were dealing with obesity. Suddenly  it was a topic worth discussing at schools and in the workplace. And the large companies  they typically have wonderful wellness programs  but the medium sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this  they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others. And then came the next stage of the equation. It was time to push what I called MAPS  . Now MAPS    like the other two programs  had had an economic development motive behind it  but along with the traditional economic development tasks like building a new convention center  we added some health related infrastructure to the process. We added a new central park     acres in size  to be right downtown in Oklahoma City. We're building a downtown streetcar to try and help the walkability formula for people who choose to live in the inner city and help us create the density there. We're building senior health and wellness centers throughout the community. We put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original MAPS  and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe  kayak and rowing. We hosted the Olympic trials last spring. We have Olympic caliber events coming to Oklahoma City  and athletes from all over the world moving in  along with inner city programs to get kids more engaged in these types of recreational activities that are a little bit nontraditional. We also  with another initiative that was passed  are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks throughout the metro area. We're even going back into some inner city situations where we had built neighborhoods and we had built schools but we had not connected the two. We had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods  but we had never really connected the two with any sort of walkability. Through yet another funding source  we're redesigning all of our inner city streets to be more pedestrian friendly. Our streets were really wide  and you'd push the button to allow you to walk across  and you had to run in order to get there in time. But now we've narrowed the streets  highly landscaped them  making them more pedestrian friendly  really a redesign  rethinking the way we build our infrastructure  designing a city around people and not cars. We're completing our bicycle trail master plan. We'll have over     miles when we're through building it out. And so you see this culture starting to shift in Oklahoma City. And lo and behold  the demographic changes that are coming with it are very inspiring. Highly educated twentysomethings are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region and  indeed  even from further away  in California. When we reached a million pounds  in January of       I flew to New York with some our participants who had lost over     pounds  whose lives had been changed  and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show  and then that afternoon  I did a round of media in New York pushing the same messages that you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it. And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine  the same magazine that had put us on that list five years before. And as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter  I notice there's a magazine copy of the current issue right there on the table  and I pick it up  and I look at the headline across the top  and it says   America's Fattest Cities  Do You Live in One   Well  I knew I did  so I picked up the magazine and I began to look  and we weren't on it. Then I looked on the list of fittest cities  and we were on that list. We were on the list as the   nd fittest city in the United States. Our state health statistics are doing better. Granted  we have a long way to go. Health is still not something that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City  but we seem to have turned the cultural shift of making health a greater priority. And we love the idea of the demographics of highly educated twentysomethings  people with choices  choosing Oklahoma City in large numbers. We have the lowest unemployment in the United States  probably the strongest economy in the United States. And if you're like me  at some point in your educational career  you were asked to read a book called  The Grapes of Wrath.  Oklahomans leaving for California in large numbers for a better future. When we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west  it appears that what we're seeing now is the wrath of grapes. The grandchildren are coming home. You've been a great audience and very attentive. Thank you very much for having me here. Hello  TEDWomen  what's up. Not good enough. Hello  TEDWomen  what is up  My name is Maysoon Zayid  and I am not drunk  but the doctor who delivered me was. He cut my mom six different times in six different directions  suffocating poor little me in the process. As a result  I have cerebral palsy  which means I shake all the time. Look. It's exhausting. I'm like Shakira  Shakira meets Muhammad Ali. CP is not genetic. It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it. No one put a curse on my mother's uterus  and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins  which they are. It only happens from accidents  like what happened to me on my birth day. Now  I must warn you  I'm not inspirational. And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me  because at some point in your life  you have dreamt of being disabled. Come on a journey with me. It's Christmas Eve  you're at the mall  you're driving around in circles looking for parking  and what do you see  Sixteen empty handicapped spaces. And you're like   God  can't I just be a little disabled   Also  I've got to tell you  I've got    problems  and palsy is just one. If there was an Oppression Olympics  I would win the gold medal. I'm Palestinian  Muslim  I'm female  I'm disabled  and I live in New Jersey. If you don't feel better about yourself  maybe you should. Cliffside Park  New Jersey is my hometown. I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials. I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City  I could. A lot of people with CP don't walk  but my parents didn't believe in  can't.  My father's mantra was   You can do it  yes you can can.  So  if my three older sisters were mopping  I was mopping. If my three older sisters went to public school  my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too  and if we didn't all get A's  we all got my mother's slipper. My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking. Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it. My inner stripper was very strong. Yeah. No  by the first day of kindergarten  I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times. Growing up  there were only six Arabs in my town  and they were all my family. Now there are    Arabs in town  and they are still all my family. I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian. This was before      and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use  I hate Muslims  as a campaign slogan. The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith. They did  however  seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan. I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months  so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake. I have tap danced on Broadway. Yeah  on Broadway. It's crazy. My parents couldn't afford physical therapy  so they sent me to dancing school. I learned how to dance in heels  which means I can walk in heels. And I'm from Jersey  and we are really concerned with being chic  so if my friends wore heels  so did I. And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore  I did not. I spent my summers in a war zone  because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer  we'd grow up to be Madonna. Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me  so I drank deer's milk  I had hot cups on my back  I was dunked in the Dead Sea  and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking   It's working  It's working   But one miracle cure we did find was yoga. I have to tell you  it's very boring  but before I did yoga  I was a stand up comedian who can't stand up. And now I can stand on my head. My parents reinforced this notion that I could do anything  that no dream was impossible  and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera  General Hospital.  I went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to ASU  Arizona State University  because I fit every single quota. I was like the pet lemur of the theater department. Everybody loved me. I did all the less than intelligent kids' homework  I got A's in all of my classes  A's in all of their classes. Every time I did a scene from  The Glass Menagerie   my professors would weep. But I never got cast. Finally  my senior year  ASU decided to do a show called  They Dance Real Slow in Jackson.  It's a play about a girl with CP. I was a girl with CP. So I start shouting from the rooftops   I'm finally going to get a part  I have cerebral palsy  Free at last  Free at last  Thank God almighty  I'm free at last   I didn't get the part. Sherry Brown got the part. I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically  like someone shot my cat  to ask her why  and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts. I said   Excuse me  if I can't do the stunts  neither can the character.  This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a non palsy actress. College was imitating life. Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able bodied actors to play disabled onscreen. Upon graduating  I moved back home  and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera. My dream was coming true. And I knew that I would be promoted from  Diner Diner  to  Wacky Best Friend  in no time. But instead  I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head  and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy  ethnic  disabled actors. They only hired perfect people. But there were exceptions to the rule. I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg  Roseanne Barr  Ellen  and all of these women had one thing in common  they were comedians. So I became a comic. My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey  and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with CP driving him. I've performed in clubs all over America  and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East  uncensored and uncovered. Some people say I'm the first stand up comic in the Arab world. I never like to claim first  but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny  and they find us hysterical. In       my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab American Comedy Festival  now in its   th year. Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab Americans in media  while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous. Mainstreaming Arabs was much  much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability. My big break came in     . I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show  Countdown with Keith Olbermann.  I walked in looking like I was going to the prom  and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning  rolling chair. So I looked at the stage manager and I'm like   Excuse me  can I have another chair   And she looked at me and she went   Five  four  three  two ...  And we were live  right  So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment  and when the interview was over  I was livid. I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it  and I knew I would never get invited back. But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back  he made me a full time contributor  and he taped down my chair. One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann was that humans on the Internet are scumbags. People say children are cruel  but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult. Suddenly  my disability on the world wide web is fair game. I would look at clips online and see comments like   Yo  why's she tweakin'    Yo  is she retarded   And my favorite   Poor Gumby mouth terrorist. What does she suffer from  We should really pray for her.  One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits  screenwriter  comedian  palsy. Disability is as visual as race. If a wheelchair user can't play Beyonc   then Beyonc  can't play a wheelchair user. The disabled are the largest   Yeah  clap for that  man. Come on. People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world  and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment. The doctors said that I wouldn't walk  but I am here in front of you. However  if I grew up with social media  I don't think I would be. I hope that together  we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life. Perhaps if there were more positive images  it would foster less hate on the Internet. Or maybe not. Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well. My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places. I got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci and the iconic Loreen Arbus. I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol  the amazing Dave Matthews. I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild. I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the      DNC. And I founded Maysoon's Kids  a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me. But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got    before this moment    But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee  has Parkinson's and shakes just like me  Muhammad Ali. It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live  and I dedicate this talk to his memory. and if I can can  you can can. Good morning  Are you awake  They took my name tag  but I wanted to ask you  did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic  Anyone  No one  All right  no problem. Once upon a time  not long ago  I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend  ordering food. So I looked at the waiter and said   Do you have a menu  Arabic    He looked at me strangely  thinking that he misheard. He said   Sorry   English .  I said   The menu  Arabic   please.  He replied   Don't you know what they call it    I do.  He said   No  It's called  menu   English   or  menu   French .  Is the French pronunciation correct   Come  come  take care of this one   said the waiter. He was disgusted when talking to me  as if he was saying to himself   If this was the last girl on Earth  I wouldn't look at her   What's the meaning of saying  menu  in Arabic  Two words made a Lebanese young man judge a girl as being backward and ignorant. How could she speak that way  At that moment  I started thinking. It made me mad. It definitely hurts  I'm denied the right to speak my own language in my own country  Where could this happen  How did we get here  Well  while we are here  there are many people like me  who would reach a stage in their lives  where they involuntarily give up everything that has happened to them in the past  just so they can say that they're modern and civilized. Should I forget all my culture  thoughts  intellect and all my memories  Childhood stories might be the best memories we have of the war  Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic  just to conform  To be one of them  Where's the logic in that  Despite all that  I tried to understand him. I didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me. The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs. It's not a language for science  research  a language we're used to in universities  a language we use in the workplace  a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project  and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport. If we did so  they'd strip us of our clothes. Where can I use it  then  We could all ask this question  So  you want us to use Arabic. Where are we to do so  This is one reality. But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about. Arabic is the mother tongue. Research says that mastery of other languages demands mastery of the mother tongue. Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite for creative expression in other languages. How  Gibran Khalil Gibran  when he first started writing  he used Arabic. All his ideas  imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up  smelling a specific smell  hearing a specific voice  and thinking a specific thought. So  when he started writing in English  he had enough baggage. Even when he wrote in English  when you read his writings in English  you smell the same smell  sense the same feeling. You can imagine that that's him writing in English  the same boy who came from the mountain. From a village on Mount Lebanon. So  this is an example no one can argue with. Second  it's often said that if you want to kill a nation  the only way to kill a nation  is to kill its language. This is a reality that developed societies are aware of. The Germans  French  Japanese and Chinese  all these nations are aware of this. That's why they legislate to protect their language. They make it sacred. That's why they use it in production  they pay a lot of money to develop it. Do we know better than them  All right  we aren't from the developed world  this advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet  and we would like to catch up with the civilized world. Countries that were once like us  but decided to strive for development  do research  and catch up with those countries  such as Turkey  Malaysia and others  they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder  protected it like a diamond. They kept it close to them. Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish  then it isn't a local product. You wouldn't believe it's a local product. They'd go back to being consumers  clueless consumers  like we are most of the time. So  in order for them to innovate and produce  they had to protect their language. If I say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence  Arabic    what does this remind you of  It doesn't ring a bell  does it  Regardless of the who  how and why. Language isn't just for conversing  just words coming out of our mouths. Language represents specific stages in our lives  and terminology that is linked to our emotions. So when we say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence   each one of you draws a specific image in their own mind  there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period. Language isn't one  two or three words or letters put together. It's an idea inside that relates to how we think  and how we see each other and how others see us. What is our intellect  How do you say whether this guy understands or not  So  if I say   Freedom  sovereignty  independence  English    or if your son came up to you and said   Dad  have you lived through the period of the freedom  English  slogan   How would you feel  If you don't see a problem  then I'd better leave  and stop talking in vain. The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing. I have a francophone friend who's married to a French man. I asked her once how things were going. She said   Everything is fine  but once  I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word 'toqborni' for him.  The poor woman had mistakenly told him  toqborni   and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him. He was puzzled by the thought   How could anyone be this cruel  Does she want to commit suicide  'Bury me '  English   This is one of the few examples. It made us feel that she's unable to tell that word to her husband  since he won't understand  and he's right not to  his way of thinking is different. She said to me   He listens to Fairuz with me  and one night  I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to Fairuz.  The poor woman tried to translate this for him   From them I extended my hands and stole you     And here's the pickle   And because you belong to them  I returned my hands and left you.  Translate that for me. So  what have we done to protect the Arabic language  We turned this into a concern of the civil society  and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language. Even though many people told me   Why do you bother  Forget about this headache and go have fun.  No problem  The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a slogan that says   I talk to you from the East  but you reply from the West.  We didn't say   No  We do not accept this or that.  We didn't adopt this style because that way  we wouldn't be understood. And when someone talks to me that way  I hate the Arabic language. We say   We want to change our reality  and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams  aspirations and day to day life. In a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do. So   I talk to you from the East  but you reply from the West  has hit the spot. Something very easy  yet creative and persuasive. After that  we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground. You've seen an example of it outside  a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with  Don't kill your language   written on it. Why  Seriously  don't kill your language. We really shouldn't kill our language. If we were to kill the language  we'd have to find an identity. We'd have to find an existence. We'd go back to the beginning. This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized. After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter. Photos of  cool  guys and girls. We are very cool  And to whoever might say   Ha  You used an English word   I say   No  I adopt the word 'cool.'  Let them object however they want  but give me a word that's nicer and matches the reality better. I will keep on saying  Internet  I wouldn't say   I'm going to the world wide web  Because it doesn't fit  We shouldn't kid ourselves. But to reach this point  we all have to be convinced that we shouldn't allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language  to control us or make us think and feel what they want. Creativity is the idea. So  if we can't reach space or build a rocket and so on  we can be creative. At this moment  every one of you is a creative project. Creativity in your mother tongue is the path. Let's start from this moment. Let's write a novel or produce a short film. A single novel could make us global again. It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one. So  it's not true that there's no solution  there is a solution  But we have to know that  and be convinced that a solution exists  that we have a duty to be part of that solution. In conclusion  what can you do today  Now  tweets  who's tweeting  Please  I beg of you  even though my time has finished  either Arabic  English  French or Chinese. But don't write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers  It's a disaster  That's not a language. You'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language. It's not easy to come back from such a place and rise. That's the first thing we can do. Second  there are many other things that we can do. We're not here today to convince each other. We're here to bring attention to the necessity of preserving this language. Now I will tell you a secret. A baby first identifies its father through language. When my daughter is born  I'll tell her   This is your father  honey  Arabic .  I wouldn't say   This is your dad  honey  English .  And in the supermarket  I promise my daughter Noor  that if she says to me   Thanks  Arabic    I won't say   Dis  'Merci  Maman '  and hope no one has heard her. Let's get rid of this cultural cringe. So this is a picture of my dad and me at the beach in Far Rockaway  or actually Rockaway Park. I'm the one with the blond hair. My dad's the guy with the cigarette. It was the '  s. A lot of people smoked back then. In the summer of       my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. Cancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody. If you're a man in the United States of the America  you've got about a one in two chance of being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime. If you're a woman  you've got about a one in three chance of being diagnosed with cancer. Everybody knows somebody who's been diagnosed with cancer. Now  my dad's doing better today  and part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial of an experimental new drug that happened to be specially formulated and very good for his particular kind of cancer. There are over     kinds of cancer. And what I want to talk about today is how we can help more people like my dad  because we have to change the way we think about raising money to fund cancer research. So a while after my dad was diagnosed  I was having coffee with my friend Andrew Lo. He's the head of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT  where I also have a position  and we were talking about cancer. And Andrew had been doing his own bits of research  and one of the things that he had been told and that he'd learned from studying the literature was that there's actually a big bottleneck. It's very difficult to develop new drugs  and the reason it's difficult to develop new drugs is because in the early stages of drug development  the drugs are very risky  and they're very expensive. So Andrew asked me if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit  work on some of the math and the analytics and see if we could figure out something we could do. Now I'm not a scientist. You know  I don't know how to build a drug. And none of my coauthors  Andrew Lo or Jose Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan    none of those guys    are scientists either. We don't know the first thing about how to make a cancer drug. But we know a little bit about risk mitigation and a little bit about financial engineering  and so we started thinking  what could we do  What I'm going to tell you about is some work we've been doing over the last couple years that we think could fundamentally change the way research for cancer and lots of other things gets done. We want to let the research drive the funding  not the other way around. So in order to get started  let me tell you how you get a drug financed. Imagine that you're in your lab    you're a scientist  you're not like me    you're a scientist  and you've developed a new compound that you think might be therapeutic for somebody with cancer. Well  what you do is  you test in animals  you test in test tubes  but there's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside  and in order to get from the bench  the lab  to the bedside  to the patients  you've got to get the drug tested. And the way the drug gets tested is through a series of  basically  experiments  through these large  they're called trials  that they do to determine whether the drug is safe and whether it works and all these things. So the FDA has a very specific protocol. In the first phase of this testing  which is called testing for toxicity  it's called Phase I. In the first phase  you give the drug to healthy people and you see if it actually makes them sick. In other words  are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does  it's not going to be worth it  Does it cause heart attacks  kill people  liver failure  this kind of thing  And it turns out  that's a pretty high hurdle. About a third of all drugs drop out at that point. In the next phase  you test to see if the drug's effective  and what you do there is you give it to people with cancer and you see if it actually makes them better. And that's also a higher hurdle. People drop out. And in the third phase  you actually test it on a very large sample  and what you're trying to determine is what the right dose is  and also  is it better than what's available today  If not  then why build it  When you're done with all that  what you have is a very small percentage of drugs that start the process actually come out the other side. So those blue bottles  those blue bottles save lives  and they're also worth billions  sometimes billions a year. So now here's a question  if I were to ask you  for example  to make a one time investment of  say      million dollars to buy one of those bottles  so     million dollars up front  one time  to buy one of those bottles  I won't tell you which one it is  and in    years  I'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones. Does that sound like a good deal for anybody  No. No  right  And of course  it's a very  very risky trial position  and that's why it's very hard to get funding  but to a first approximation  that's actually the proposal. You have to fund these things from the early stages on. It takes a long time. So Andrew said to me  he said   What if we stop thinking about these as drugs  What if we start thinking about them as financial assets   They've got really weird payoff structures and all that  but let's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them. Let's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets  Let's create a giant fund. In finance  we know what to do with assets that are risky. You put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns. So we did some math  and it turned out you could make this work  but in order to make it work  you need about    to     drugs. Now the good news is  there's plenty of drugs that are waiting to be tested. We've been told that there's a backlog of about    years of drugs that are waiting to be tested but can't be funded. In fact  that early stage of the funding process  that Phase I and pre clinical stuff  that's actually  in the industry   called the Valley of Death because it's where drugs go to die. It's very hard to for them to get through there  and of course  if you can't get through there  you can't get to the later stages. So we did this math  and we figured out  okay  well  you know  you need about    to  say       or something like that  drugs. And then we did a little more math  and we said  okay  well that's a fund of about three to    billion dollars. So we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one. We were able to get rid of the risk  but now we need a lot of capital  and there's only one place to get that kind of capital  the capital markets. Venture capitalists don't have it. Philanthropies don't have it. But we have to figure out how we can get people in the capital markets  who traditionally don't invest in this stuff  to want to invest in this stuff. So again  financial engineering was helpful here. Imagine the megafund actually starts empty  and what it does is it issues some debt and some equity  and that generates cash flow. That cash flow is used  then  to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need  and those drugs start working their way through that approval process  and each time they go through a next phase of approval  they gain value. And most of them don't make it  but a few of them do  and with the ones that gain value  you can sell some  and when you sell them  you have money to pay the interest on those bonds  but you also have money to fund the next round of trials. It's almost self funding. You do that for the course of the transaction  and when you're done  you liquidate the portfolio  pay back the bonds  and you can give the equity holders a nice return. So that was the theory  and we talked about it for a bit  we did a bunch of experiments  and then we said  let's really try to test it. We spent the next two years doing research. We talked to hundreds of experts in drug financing and venture capital. We talked to people who have developed drugs. We talked to pharmaceutical companies. We actually looked at the data for drugs  over       drugs that had been approved or denied or withdrawn  and we also ran millions of simulations. And all that actually took a lot of time. But when we were done  what we found was something that was sort of surprising. It was actually feasible to structure that fund such that when you were done structuring it  you could actually produce low risk bonds that would be attractive to bond holders  that would give you yields of about five to eight percent  and you could produce equity that would give equity holders about a    percent return. Now those returns aren't going to be attractive to a venture capitalist. Venture capitalists are those guys who want to make those big bets and get those billion dollar payoffs. But it turns out  there are lots of other folks that would be interested in that. That's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds and     k  plans and all this other stuff. So we published some articles in the academic press. We published articles in medical journals. We published articles in finance journals. But it wasn't until we actually got the popular press interested in this that we began to get some traction. We wanted to do something more than just make people aware of it  though. We wanted people to get involved. So what we did was  we actually took all of our computer code and made that available online under an open source license to anybody that wanted it. And you guys can download it today if you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work. And that was really effective  because people that didn't believe our assumptions could try their own assumptions and see how it would work. Now there's an obvious problem  which is  is there enough money in the world to fund this stuff  I've told you there's enough drugs  but is there enough money  There's     trillion dollars of capital currently invested in fixed income securities. That's a hundred thousand billion. There's plenty of money. But what we realized was that it's more than just money that's required. We had to get people motivated  people to get involved  and people had to understand this. And so we started thinking about all  the different things that could go wrong. What are all the challenges to doing  this that might get in the way  And we had a long list  and so what we did was we assigned a bunch of people  including ourselves  different pieces of this problem  and we said  could you start a work stream on credit risk  Could you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects  Could you start a work stream on how you would actually manage so many projects  And we had all these experts get together and do these different work streams  and then we held a conference. The conference was held over the summer  this past summer. It was an invitation only conference. It was sponsored by the American Cancer Society and done in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute. And we had experts from every field that we thought would be important  including the government  including people that run research centers and so on  and for two days they sat around and heard the reports from those five work streams  and they talked about it. It was the first time that the people who could actually make this happen sat across the table from each other and had these conversations. Now these conferences  it's typical to have a dinner  and at that dinner  you kind of get to know each other  sort of like what we're doing here. I happened to look out the window  and hand on my heart  I looked out the window on the night of this conference    it was the summertime    and that's what I saw  it was a double rainbow. So I'd like to think it was a good sign. Since the conference  we've got people working between Paris and San Francisco  lots of different folks working on this to try to see if we can really make it happen. We're not looking to start a fund  but we want somebody else to do this. Because  again  I'm not a scientist. I can't build a drug. I'm never going to have enough money to fund even one of those trials. But all of us together  with our     k 's  with our     plans  with our pension plans  all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials and get paid well for doing it and save millions of lives like my dad. Thank you. Three and a half years ago  I made one of the best decisions of my life. As my New Year's resolution  I gave up dieting  stopped worrying about my weight  and learned to eat mindfully. Now I eat whenever I'm hungry  and I've lost    pounds. This was me at age     when I started my first diet. I look at that picture now  and I think  you did not need a diet  you needed a fashion consult. But I thought I needed to lose weight  and when I gained it back  of course I blamed myself. And for the next three decades  I was on and off various diets. No matter what I tried  the weight I'd lost always came back. I'm sure many of you know the feeling. As a neuroscientist  I wondered  why is this so hard  Obviously  how much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you burn. What most people don't realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain  mostly without your awareness. Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes  and that is a good thing  because your conscious mind    how do we put this politely     it's easily distracted. It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie. You don't forget how to walk because you're thinking about what to have for dinner. Your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh  no matter what you consciously believe. This is called your set point  but that's a misleading term  because it's actually a range of about    or    pounds. You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range  but it's much  much harder to stay outside of it. The hypothalamus  the part of the brain that regulates body weight  there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight  more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it  and the system works like a thermostat  responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger  activity and metabolism  to keep your weight stable as conditions change. That's what a thermostat does  right  It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside. Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter  but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat  which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up. Your brain works exactly the same way  responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal. If you lose a lot of weight  your brain reacts as if you were starving  and whether you started out fat or thin  your brain's response is exactly the same. We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not  but it can't. If you do lose a lot of weight  you become hungry  and your muscles burn less energy. Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University has found that people who have lost    percent of their body weight burn     to     calories less because their metabolism is suppressed. That's a lot of food. This means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who has always been thin. From an evolutionary perspective  your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense. When food was scarce  our ancestors' survival depended on conserving energy  and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage. Over the course of human history  starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating. This may explain a very sad fact  Set points can go up  but they rarely go down. Now  if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair  this is the kind of thing she was talking about. Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point. Even after you've kept the weight off for as long as seven years  your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back. If that weight loss had been due to a long famine  that would be a sensible response. In our modern world of drive thru burgers  it's not working out so well for many of us. That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available  and it's also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity. Sadly  a temporary weight gain can become permanent. If you stay at a high weight for too long  probably a matter of years for most of us  your brain may decide that that's the new normal. Psychologists classify eaters into two groups  those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower  like most dieters. Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters. The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight  and they spend less time thinking about food. Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising  super sizing  and the all you can eat buffet. And a small indulgence  like eating one scoop of ice cream  is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters. Children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging. Several long term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later  even if they started at a normal weight  and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders. The other factor  by the way  those of you who are parents  was being teased by family members about their weight. So don't do that. I left almost all my graphs at home  but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one  because I'm a geek  and that's how I roll. This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a    year period based on four healthy habits  eating enough fruits and vegetables  exercise three times a week  not smoking  and drinking in moderation. Let's start by looking at the normal weight people in the study. The height of the bars is the risk of death  and those zero  one  two  three  four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had. And as you'd expect  the healthier the lifestyle  the less likely people were to die during the study. Now let's look at what happens in overweight people. The ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death. Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range. For obese people with no healthy habits  the risk is very high  seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study. But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too. In fact  if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits  you can see that weight makes very little difference. You can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle  even If you can't lose weight and keep it off. Diets don't have very much reliability. Five years after a diet  most people have regained the weight. Forty percent of them have gained even more. If you think about this  the typical outcome of dieting is that you're more likely to gain weight in the long run than to lose it. If I've convinced you that dieting might be a problem  the next question is  what do you do about it  And my answer  in a word  is mindfulness. I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga. I'm talking about mindful eating  learning to understand your body's signals so that you eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full  because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you're not hungry. How do you do it  Give yourself permission to eat as much as you want  and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good. Sit down to regular meals without distractions. Think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop  and let your hunger decide when you should be done. It took about a year for me to learn this  but it's really been worth it. I am so much more relaxed around food than I have ever been in my life. I often don't think about it. I forget we have chocolate in the house. It's like aliens have taken over my brain. It's just completely different. I should say that this approach to eating probably won't make you lose weight unless you often eat when you're not hungry  but doctors don't know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people  and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight gain instead of promoting weight loss. Let's face it  If diets worked  we'd all be thin already. Why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results  Diets may seem harmless  but they actually do a lot of collateral damage. At worst  they ruin lives  Weight obsession leads to eating disorders  especially in young kids. In the U.S.  we have    percent of    year old girls say they've been on a diet. Our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale. Even at its best  dieting is a waste of time and energy. It takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project  and because willpower is limited  any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else. Let me leave you with one last thought. What if we told all those dieting girls that it's okay to eat when they're hungry  What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it  I think most of them would be happier and healthier  and as adults  many of them would probably be thinner. I wish someone had told me that back when I was   . Thanks. This is an image of the planet Earth. It looks very much like the Apollo pictures that are very well known. There is something different  you can click on it  and if you click on it  you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth. For instance  this is a bird's eye view of the EPFL campus. In many cases  you can also see how a building looks from a nearby street. This is pretty amazing. But there's something missing in this wonderful tour  It's time. i'm not really sure when this picture was taken. I'm not even sure it was taken at the same moment as the bird's eye view. In my lab  we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time. The kind of question we're asking is Is it possible to build something like Google Maps of the past  Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps and just change the year  seeing how it was     years before        years before  Is that possible  Can I reconstruct social networks of the past  Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages  So  can I build time machines  Maybe we can just say   No  it's not possible.  Or  maybe  we can think of it from an information point of view. This is what I call the information mushroom. Vertically  you have the time. and horizontally  the amount of digital information available. Obviously  in the last    years  we have much information. And obviously the more we go in the past  the less information we have. If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past  or Facebook of the past  we need to enlarge this space  we need to make that like a rectangle. How do we do that  One way is digitization. There's a lot of material available    newspaper  printed books  thousands of printed books. I can digitize all these. I can extract information from these. Of course  the more you go in the past  the less information you will have. So  it might not be enough. So  I can do what historians do. I can extrapolate. This is what we call  in computer science  simulation. If I take a log book  I can consider  it's not just a log book of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey. I can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period. I'm extrapolating. If I have a painting of a facade  I can consider it's not just that particular building  but probably it also shares the same grammar of buildings where we lost any information. So if we want to construct a time machine  we need two things. We need very large archives  and we need excellent specialists. The Venice Time Machine  the project I'm going to talk to you about  is a joint project between the EPFL and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari. There's something very peculiar about Venice  that its administration has been very  very bureaucratic. They've been keeping track of everything  almost like Google today. At the Archivio di Stato  you have    kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of Venice over more than       years. You have every boat that goes out  every boat that comes in. You have every change that was made in the city. This is all there. We are setting up a    year digitization program which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system. The type of objective we want to reach is     books a day that can be digitized. Of course  when you digitize  that's not enough  because these documents  most of them are in Latin  in Tuscan  in Venetian dialect  so you need to transcribe them  to translate them in some cases  to index them  and this is obviously not easy. In particular  traditional optical character recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts  they do not work well on the handwritten document. So the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain  speech recognition. This is a domain of something  that seems impossible  which can actually be done  simply by putting additional constraints. If you have a very good model of a language which is used  if you have a very good model of a document  how well they are structured. And these are administrative documents. They are well structured in many cases. If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets where a smaller subset actually shares similar features  then there's a chance of success. If we reach that stage  then there's something else  we can extract from this document events. Actually probably    billion events can be extracted from this archive. And this giant information system can be searched in many ways. You can ask questions like   Who lived in this palazzo in         How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market in         What was the salary of a glass maker in Murano maybe over a decade   You can ask even bigger questions because it will be semantically coded. And then what you can do is put that in space  because much of this information is spatial. And from that  you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed to have a sustainable development over a thousand years  managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment. You can reconstruct that journey  visualize it in many different ways. But of course  you cannot understand  Venice if you just look at the city. You have to put it in a larger European context. So the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the European level. We can reconstruct also the journey of the Venetian maritime empire  how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea  how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time  controlling most of the sea routes from the east to the south. But you can even do other things  because in these maritime routes  there are regular patterns. You can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system  create a Mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing  which would enable us to have  questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner.  If I am in Corfu in June      and want to go to Constantinople  where can I take a boat   Probably we can answer this question with one or two or three days' precision.  How much will it cost    What are the chance of encountering pirates   Of course  you understand  the central scientific challenge of a project like this one is qualifying  quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process. There are errors everywhere  errors in the document  it's the wrong name of the captain  some of the boats never actually took to sea. There are errors in translation  interpretative biases  and on top of that  if you add algorithmic processes  you're going to have errors in recognition  errors in extraction  so you have very  very uncertain data. So how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies  How can we represent that form of uncertainty  It's difficult. One thing you can do is document each step of the process  not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta historical information  how is historical knowledge constructed  documenting each step. That will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of Venice  but probably we can actually reconstruct a fully documented potential story of Venice. Maybe there's not a single map. Maybe there are several maps. The system should allow for that  because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty  which is really new for this type of giant databases. And how should we communicate this new research to a large audience  Again  Venice is extraordinary for that. With the millions of visitors that come every year  it's actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future. Imagine  horizontally you see the reconstructed map of a given year  and vertically  you see the document that served the reconstruction  paintings  for instance. Imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the Venice of a given year  some experience you could share within a group. On the contrary  imagine actually that you start from a document  a Venetian manuscript  and you show  actually  what you can construct out of it  how it is decoded  how the context of that document can be recreated. This is an image from an exhibit which is currently conducted in Geneva with that type of system. So to conclude  we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences    years ago. It's really a question of scale. We see projects which are much beyond any single research team can do  and this is really new for the humanities  which very often take the habit of working in small groups or only with a couple of researchers. When you visit the Archivio di Stato  you feel this is beyond what any single team can do  and that should be a joint and common effort. So what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of  digital humanists  that are going to be ready for this shift. I thank you very much. For any of you who have visited or lived in New York City  these shots might start to look familiar. This is Central Park  one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in America. But to anyone who hasn't visited  these images can't really fully convey. To really understand Central Park  you have to physically be there. Well  the same is true of the music  which my brother and I composed and mapped specifically for Central Park. I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother Hays and I are doing    That's us there. That's both of us actually   specifically about a concept that we've been developing over the last few years  this idea of location aware music. Now  my brother and I  we're musicians and music producers. We've been working together since  well  since we were kids  really. But recently  we've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect  from creating sight specific audio and video installation to engineering interactive concerts. But today I want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space. But before I go too much further into that  let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea. My brother and I were living in New York City when the artists Christo and Jeanne Claude did their temporary installation  The Gates  in Central Park. Hundreds of these brightly colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks  and unlike work that's exhibited in a more neutral space  like on the walls of a gallery or a museum  this was work that was really in dialogue with this place  and in a lot of ways  The Gates was really a celebration of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design. This was an experience that stayed with us for a long time  and years later  my brother and I moved back to Washington  D.C.  and we started to ask the question  would it be possible  in the same way that The Gates responded to the physical layout of the park  to compose music for a landscape  Which brought us to this. On Memorial Day  we released  The National Mall   a location aware album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device's built in GPS functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of Washington  D.C. Hundreds of musical segments are geo tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape  a musical score is actually unfolding around them. So this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park  but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener's chosen trajectory. So think of this as a choose your own adventure of an album. Let's take a closer look. Let's look at one example here. So using the app  as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the Washington Monument  you hear the sounds of instruments warming up  which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody. This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins. Keep walking  and a full choir joins in  until you finally reach the top of the hill and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks and all sorts of musical craziness  as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park. But were you to walk in the opposite direction  this entire sequence happens in reverse. And were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park  the music would fade to silence  and the play button would disappear. We're sometimes contacted by  people in other parts of the world who can't travel to the United States  but would like to hear this record. Well  unlike a normal album  we haven't been able to accommodate this request. When they ask for a C.D. or an MP  version  we just can't make that happen  and the reason is because this isn't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record. In this case  the app is the work itself  and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience. Six months later  we did a location aware album for Central Park  a park that is over two times the size of the National Mall  with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow to the Ramble to the Reservoir. Currently  my brother and I are working on projects all over the country  but last spring we started a project  here actually at Stanford's Experimental Media Art Department  where we're creating our largest location aware album to date  one that will span the entirety of Highway   here on the Pacific Coast. But what we're doing  integrating GPS with music  is really just one idea. But it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age  that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model  but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music. Thank you. The entire model of capitalism and the economic model that you and I did business in  and  in fact  continue to do business in  was built around what probably Milton Friedman put more succinctly. And Adam Smith  of course   the father of modern economics actually said many  many years ago  the invisible hand  which is   If you continue to operate in your own self interest you will do the best good for society.  Now  capitalism has done a lot of good things and I've talked about a lot of good  things that have happened  but equally  it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we've seen in society. The model that at least I was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what I call the three G's of growth  growth that is consistent  quarter on quarter  growth that is competitive  better than the other person  and growth that is profitable  so you continue to make more and more shareholder value. And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough and we have to move from this  G model to a model of what I call the fourth G  the G of growth that is responsible. And it is this that has to become a very important part of creating value. Of not just creating economic value but creating social value. And companies that will thrive are those that will actually embrace the fourth G. And the model of  G is quite simple  Companies cannot afford  to be just innocent bystanders in what's happening around in society. They have to begin to play their role in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them. And we have to move to a model of an and and model which is how do we make money and do good  How do we make sure that we have a great business but we also have a great environment around us  And that model is all about doing well and doing good. But the question is easier said than done. But how do we actually get that done  And I do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership. It is going to be to redefine the new business models which understand that the only license to operate is to combine these things. And for that you need businesses that can actually define their role in society in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell. And companies that actually define a true north  things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good  bad  ugly    doesn't matter. There are things that you stand for. Values and purpose are going to be the two drivers of software that are going to create the companies of tomorrow. And I'm going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences. I joined Unilever in      as a management trainee in India. And on my first day of work I walked in and my boss tells me   Do you know why you're here   I said   I'm here to sell a lot of soap.  And he said    No  you're here to change lives.  You're here to change lives. You know  I thought it was rather facetious. We are a company that sells soap and soup. What are we doing about changing lives  And it's then I realized that simple acts like selling a bar of soap can save more lives than pharmaceutical companies. I don't know how many of you know that five million children don't reach the age of five because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap. We run the largest hand washing program in the world. We are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people. It's not about selling soap  there is a larger purpose out there. And brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change. And the reason for that is  when two billion people use your brands that's the amplifier. Small actions can make a big difference. Take another example  I was walking around in  one of our villages in India. Now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park. And we had this lady who was one of our small distributors    beautiful  very  very modest  her home    and she was out there  dressed nicely  her husband in the back  her mother in law behind and her sister in law behind her. The social order was changing because this lady is part of our Project Shakti that is actually teaching women how to do small business and how to carry the message of nutrition and hygiene. We have        such women now in India. It's not about selling soap  it's about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people's lives. Small actions  big difference. Our R D folks are not only working to give us  some fantastic detergents  but they're working to make sure we use less water. A product that we've just launched recently  One Rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes. And if we can convert all our users to using this  that's     billion liters of water. By the way  that's equivalent to one month of water for a whole huge continent. So just think about it. There are small actions that  can make a big difference. And I can go on and on. Our food chain  our brilliant products    and I'm sorry I'm giving you  a word from the sponsors    Knorr  Hellman's and all those wonderful products. We are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced from sustainable sources      percent sustainable sources. We were the first to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil from sustainable sources. I don't know how many of you know that palm oil  and not buying it from sustainable sources  can create deforestation that is responsible for    percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world. We were the first to embrace that  and it's all because we market soap and soup. And the point I'm making here is that companies like yours  companies like mine have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate. We introduced something called The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan  which said   Our purpose is to make  sustainable living commonplace  and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over     .  Now the question here is  where do we go from here  And the answer to that is very simple  We're not going to change the world alone. There are plenty of you and plenty of us who understand this. The question is  we need partnerships  we need coalitions and importantly  we need that leadership that will allow us to take this from here and to be the change that we want to see around us. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here in Edinburgh  Scotland  the birthplace of the needle and syringe. Less than a mile from here in this direction  in      a Scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe. His name was Alexander Wood  and it was at the Royal College of Physicians. This is the patent. What blows my mind when I look at it even today is that it looks almost identical to the needle in use today. Yet  it's     years old. So we turn to the field of vaccines. Most vaccines are delivered with the needle and syringe   this     year old technology. And credit where it's due    on many levels  vaccines are a successful technology. After clean water and sanitation  vaccines are the one technology that has increased our life span the most. That's a pretty hard act to beat. But just like any other technology  vaccines have their shortcomings  and the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative    this old technology. So let's start with the obvious  Many of us don't like the needle and syringe. I share that view. However     percent of the population have a thing called needle phobia. That's more than disliking the needle  that is actively avoiding being vaccinated because of needle phobia. And that's problematic in terms  of the rollout of vaccines. Now  related to this is another key issue  which is needlestick injuries. And the WHO has figures that suggest about  .  million deaths per year take place due to cross contamination with needlestick injuries. These are early deaths that take place. Now  these are two things that  you probably may have heard of  but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you  may not have heard about. One is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses. And the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that I'll tell you about as well. I'm going to tell you about some work that my team and I are doing in Australia at the University of Queensland on a technology designed to  tackle those four problems. And that technology is called the Nanopatch. Now  this is a specimen of the Nanopatch. To the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp  but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye. And there's about       projections on this particular square compared to the needle. And I've designed those projections to serve a key role  which is to  work with the skin's immune system. So that's a very important function tied in with the Nanopatch. Now we make the Nanopatch with a technique called deep reactive ion etching. And this particular technique  is one that's been borrowed from the semiconductor industry  and therefore is low cost and can be rolled out in large numbers. Now we dry coat vaccines to  the projections of the Nanopatch and apply it to the skin. Now  the simplest form of application is using our finger  but our finger has some limitations  so we've devised an applicator. And it's a very simple device    you could call it a sophisticated finger. It's a spring operated device. What we do is when we apply  the Nanopatch to the skin as so    immediately a few things happen. So firstly  the projections on the Nanopatch breach through the tough outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released    within less than a minute  in fact. Then we can take the Nanopatch off and discard it. And indeed we can make  a reuse of the applicator itself. So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch  and immediately you can see some key advantages. We've talked about it being needle free    these are projections that you can't even see    and  of course  we get around the needle phobia issue as well. Now  if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages  One is improved immune  responses through delivery  and the second is getting rid of the cold chain. So let's start with the first one   this immunogenicity idea. It takes a little while to get our heads around  but I'll try to explain it in simple terms. So I'll take a step back and explain to you how vaccines work in a simple way. So vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ. Now that safe germ  that antigen  tricks our body into mounting an immune response  learning and remembering  how to deal with intruders. When the real intruder comes along the body quickly mounts an immune response to deal with that vaccine and neutralizes the infection. So it does that well. Now  the way it's done today  with the needle and syringe  most vaccines are delivered that way    with this old technology and the needle. But it could be argued that the needle  is holding back our immune responses  it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin. To describe this idea  we need to take a journey through the skin  starting with one of those projections and applying the Nanopatch to the skin. And we see this kind of data. Now  this is real data    that thing that we can see there is one projection from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers. Now  to give you an idea of scale  if the needle was shown here  it would be too big. It would be    times bigger than the size of that screen  going    times deeper as well. It's off the grid entirely. You can see immediately that we  have those projections in the skin. That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin  but the brown layer and the magenta layer are jammed full of immune cells. As one example  in the brown layer there's a certain type of cell  called a Langerhans cell    every square millimeter of our body is jammed full of those Langerhans cells  those immune cells  and  there's others shown as well that we haven't stained in this image. But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch achieves that penetration indeed. We target thousands upon thousands  of these particular cells just residing within a hair's width of the surface of the skin. Now  as the guy that's invented this thing and designed it to do that  I found that exciting. But so what  So what if you've targeted cells  In the world of vaccines  what does that mean  The world of vaccines is getting better. It's getting more systematic. However  you still don't really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait. It's a gambler's game even today. So  we had to do that gamble. We obtained an influenza vaccine  we applied it to our Nanopatches and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin  and we waited    and this is in the live animal. We waited a month  and this is what we found out. This is a data slide showing the immune responses that we've generated with a Nanopatch compared to the needle and syringe into muscle. So on the horizontal axis we have  the dose shown in nanograms. On the vertical axis we have  the immune response generated  and that dashed line indicates  the protection threshold. If we're above that line it's considered protective  if we're below that line it's not. So the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there's only one point that  is achieved with the needle that's protective  and that's with a high dose of       nanograms. But notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue line. That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch  the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is a completely different immunogenicity curve. That's a real fresh opportunity. Suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines. We can push it one way  where we can take a vaccine  that works but is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose  compared to the needle. That can take a vaccine that's suddenly     dollars down to    cents  and that's particularly important  within the developing world. But there's another angle to this as well    you can take vaccines that currently don't work and get them over that line and get them protective. And certainly in the world of vaccines that can be important. Let's consider the big three  HIV  malaria  tuberculosis. They're responsible for about    million deaths per year  and there is no adequate vaccination  method for any of those. So potentially  with this new lever  that we have with the Nanopatch  we can help make that happen. We can push that lever to help get those  candidate vaccines over the line. Now  of course  we've worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves to this  what we've achieved with influenza. I'd like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today's vaccines  and that is the need to maintain the cold chain. As the name suggests    the cold chain    it's the requirements of keeping  a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied  to keep it refrigerated. Now  that presents some logistical challenges but we have ways to do it. This is a slightly extreme case in point but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges  in particular in resource poor settings  of what's required to get vaccines refrigerated and maintain the cold chain. If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down  but interestingly it can be too cold and the vaccine can break down as well. Now  the stakes are very high. The WHO estimates that within Africa  up to half the vaccines used there are considered to not be working properly because at some point the  cold chain has fallen over. So it's a big problem  and it's tied  in with the needle and syringe because it's a liquid form vaccine  and  when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration. A key attribute of our Nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry  and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration. Within my lab we've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at    degrees Celsius for more than a year without  any loss in activity at all. That's an important improvement. We're delighted about it as well. And the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting. And as a scientist  I love that and I love science. However  as an engineer  as a biomedical engineer and also as a human being  I'm not going to be satisfied until we've rolled this thing  out  taken it out of the lab and got it to people in large numbers and particularly the people that need it the most. So we've commenced this particular journey  and we've commenced this  journey in an unusual way. We've started with Papua New Guinea. Now  Papua New Guinea is an example  of a developing world country. It's about the same size as France  but it suffers from many of the key barriers existing within the world of today's vaccines. There's the logistics  Within this country there are only      refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled. Many of them are old  like this one in Port Moresby  many of them are breaking down and many are not in the Highlands  where they are required. That's a challenge. But also  Papua New Guinea has the  world's highest incidence of HPV  human papillomavirus  the  cervical cancer  risk factor . Yet  that vaccine is not available in large numbers because it's too expensive. So for those two reasons  with  the attributes of the Nanopatch  we've got into the field and  worked with the Nanopatch  and taken it to Papua New Guinea and we'll be following that up shortly. Now  doing this kind of work is not easy. It's challenging  but there's nothing else in  the world I'd rather be doing. And as we look ahead I'd like to share with you a thought  It's the thought of a future where the    million deaths per year that we currently have due to infectious disease is a historical footnote. And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved by improved  radically improved vaccines. Now standing here today in front of you at the birthplace of the needle and syringe  a device that's     years old  I'm presenting to you an alternative approach that could really help make that happen    and it's the Nanopatch with its attributes  of being needle free  pain free  the ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity. Thank you. Pat Mitchell  Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage. Sheryl Sandberg  First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out and see so many women. It's so not my regular experience   as I know anyone else's. PM  So when we first started talking about  maybe the subject wouldn't be social media  which we assumed it would be  but  that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions  particularly  in the sector of technology and social media. But how did that evolve for you as a thought  and end up being the TED Talk that you gave  SS  So I was really scared to get on  this stage and talk about women  because I grew up in the business  world  as I think so many of us did. You never talk about being a woman  because  someone might notice that you're a woman  right  They might notice. Or worse  if you say  woman    people on the other end of the table think you're asking for special  treatment  or complaining. Or worse  about to sue them.  And so I went through     Laughter  Right  I went through my entire business career  and never spoke about being a woman   never spoke about it publicly. But I also had noticed that it wasn't working. I came out of college over     years ago  and I thought that all of my peers were men and women   all the people above me were all men  but that would change  because your generation had done such  an amazing job fighting for equality  equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't. Because year after year  I was one of fewer and fewer  and now  often the only woman in a room. And I talked to a bunch of people about  should I give a speech at TEDWomen  about women  and they said  oh no  no. It will end your business career. You  cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman.  You'll never be taken seriously again. But fortunately  there were the few  the proud    like you    who told me I should give the speech  and I asked myself the question  Mark Zuckerberg might    the founder of Facebook and my boss    asks all of us  which is  what  would I do if I wasn't afraid  And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't  afraid is I would get on the TED stage  and talk about women  and leadership.  And I did  and survived.  Applause  PM  I would say  not only survived.  I'm thinking of that moment  Sheryl  when you and I were standing backstage  together  and you turned to me  and you told me a story. And I said    very last minute    you know   you really should share that story. SS  Oh  yeah. PM  What was that story  SS  Well  it's an important part of the  journey. So I had    TEDWomen    the original one was in D.C.    so I live here   so I had gotten on a plane the day before  and my daughter was three  she was  clinging to my leg   Mommy  don't go.  And Pat's a friend  and so  not related  to the speech I was planning on giving  which was chock full of facts and  figures  and nothing personal  I told Pat the story. I said  well   I'm having a hard day. Yesterday my daughter was clinging  to my leg  and  Don't go.  And you looked at me and said   you have to tell that story. I said  on the TED stage  Are you kidding  I'm going to get on a stage and admit  my daughter was clinging to my leg  And you said yes  because if you want to talk  about getting more women into leadership roles  you have to be honest about how hard it is. And I did. And I think that's a really  important part of the journey. The same thing happened when I wrote my book.  I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter  I thought it was fabulous. It was  chock full of data and figures  I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai  tribes  and their sociological patterns. My husband read it and he was like  this  is like eating your Wheaties.  Laughter  No one    and I apologize to Wheaties if there's  someone    no one  no one will read this book. And I realized through the process that I  had to be more honest and more open  and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still  not feeling as self confident as I should  in many situations. My first and  failed marriage. Crying at work. Felling like I didn't belong there   feeling guilty to this day. And part of my journey  starting on this stage   going to  Lean In   going to the foundation  is all about being more open and  honest about those challenges  so that other women can be more open and honest  and all of us can work together towards real equality. PM  I think that one of the most  striking parts about the book  and in my opinion  one of the reasons it's hit such  a nerve and is resonating around the world  is that you are personal in the book   and that you do make it clear that  while you've observed some things that are  very important for other women to know  that you've had the same challenges  that many others of us have  as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and  possibly the people who don't believe the same. So talk about that process  deciding  you'd go public with the private part  and then you would also put yourself in  the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges. SS  After I did the TED Talk  what happened was    you know  I never really expected to write  a book  I'm not an author  I'm not a writer  and it was viewed a lot  and it really  started impacting people's lives. I got this great     one of the first  letters I got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big  promotion at work  and she turned it down  and she told her best friend she turned  it down  and her best friend said  you really need to watch this TED Talk. And so she watched this TED Talk  and she  went back the next day  she took the job  she went home  and she handed her  husband the grocery list.  Laughter  And she said  I can do this. And what really mattered to me    it wasn't  only women in the corporate world  even though I did hear from a lot of  them  and it did impact a lot of them  it was also people of all different circumstances. There was a doctor I met who was an  attending physician at Johns Hopkins  and he said that until he saw my TED  Talk  it never really occurred to him that even though half the students in  his med school classes were women  they weren't speaking as much as  the men as he did his rounds. So he started paying attention  and as he waited for  raised hands  he realized the men's hands were up. So he started encouraging the  women to raise their hands more  and it still didn't work. So he told everyone  no more  hand raising  I'm cold calling. So he could call evenly on men and women.  And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better  and he was able to go back  to them and tell them that. And then there was the woman  stay at home  mom  lives in a really difficult neighborhood  with not a great school  she said that TED  Talk    she's never had a corporate job  but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school  and fight for a better teacher for her child. And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice. And I realized that other women and  men could find their voice through it  which is why I went from the talk to the book. PM  And in the book  you not only found your  voice  which is clear and strong in the book  but you also share what you've learned    the experiences of other people in the lessons. And that's what I'm thinking about  in terms of putting yourself in a    you became a sort of expert in how you lean in. So what did that feel like  and  become like in your life  To launch not just a book  not just  a best selling  best viewed talk  but a movement  where people began to  literally describe their actions at work as  I'm leaning in. SS  I mean  I'm grateful  I'm honored   I'm happy  and it's the very beginning. So I don't know if I'm an expert  or if anyone is  an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research. I have read every study  I have  pored over the materials  and the lessons are very clear.  Because here's what we know  What we know is that stereotypes are holding women  back from leadership roles all over the world. It's so striking.  Lean In  is very global   I've been all over the world  talking about it  and    cultures are so different. Even within our own country  to Japan   to Korea  to China  to Asia  Europe  they're so different. Except for one thing  gender. All over the world  no matter what our cultures are  we think men should be strong   assertive  aggressive  have voice  we think women should speak  when spoken to  help others. Now we have  all over the world  women are called  bossy.   There is a word for  bossy   for little girls  in every language there's one. It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys  because if a little boy leads   there's no negative word for it  it's expected. But if a little girl leads  she's bossy. Now I know there aren't a lot of  men here  but bear with me. If you're a man  you'll have  to represent your gender. Please raise your hand if you've been  told you're too aggressive at work. If you're a woman  please raise your hand if you've  ever been told you're too aggressive at work. and it's deeply supported by the data. Now  do we think women are more  aggressive than men  Of course not. It's just that we judge them through a different lens  and a lot of the character traits that you must  exhibit to perform at work  to get results  to lead  are ones that we think  in a man  he's a boss  and in a woman  she's bossy. And the good news about this is that we  can change this by acknowledging it. One of the happiest moments  I had in this whole journey is  after the book came out  I stood on a stage  with John Chambers  the CEO of Cisco. He read the book. He stood on a stage with me  he  invited me in front of his whole management team  men and women  and he said  I thought we  were good at this. I thought I was good at this. And then I read this book  and I  realized that we    my company    we have called all of our  senior women too aggressive  and I'm standing on this stage  and I'm sorry. And I want you to know we're  never going to do it again. PM  Can we send that to a lot of other  people that we know   Applause  SS  And so John is doing that because  he believes it's good for his company  and so this kind of acknowledgement  of these biases can change it. And so next time you all see  someone call a little girl  bossy   you walk right up to that person   big smile  and you say   That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has  executive leadership skills.   Laughter  PM  I know that's what you're telling your daughter.  SS  Absolutely. PM  And you did focus in the book    and  the reason  as you said  in writing it  was to create a dialogue about this. I mean  let's just put it out there   face the fact that women are    in a time when we have more open  doors  and more opportunities    are still not getting to the leadership positions. So in the months that have come since the book  in which  Lean In  focused on that and said  here are some of the challenges that remain  and  many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves. What has changed  Have you seen changes  SS  Well  there's certainly more  dialogue  which is great. But what really matters to me   and I think all of us  is action. So everywhere I go  CEOs   they're mostly men  say to me  you're costing me so much money because all the women want to  be paid as much as the men. And to them I say  I'm not sorry at all.  Laughter  At all. I mean  the women should  be paid as much as the men. Everywhere I go  women tell me they ask for raises. Everywhere I go  women say they're getting  better relationships with their spouses  asking for more help at home  asking for the  promotions they should be getting at work  and importantly  believing it  themselves. Even little things. One of the governors of one of the states told me  that he didn't realize that more women were  in fact  literally sitting on the side  of the room  which they are  and now he made a rule that all the women  on his staff need to sit at the table. The foundation I started along  with the book  Lean In  helps women  or men  start circles    small groups  it can be     it can be however many  you want  which meet once a month. I would have hoped that by now  we'd have  about     circles. That would've been great. You know      times roughly   . There are over        circles  in    countries in the world. PM  Wow  that's amazing. SS  And these are people who  are meeting every single month. I met one of them  I was in Beijing. A group of women  they're all about    or      they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing  several of them grew up in very poor  rural China. These women are     they are told by  their society that they are  left over   because they are not yet married  and the process of coming together  once a month at a meeting is helping them define who they are for themselves. What they want in their careers. The  kind of partners they want  if at all. I looked at them  we went around  and introduced ourselves  and they all said their names  and where they're from  and I said  I'm Sheryl Sandberg   and this was my dream. And I kind of just started crying. Right  which  I admit  I do. Right   I've talked about it before. But the fact that a woman so far away out in  the world  who grew up in a rural village  who's being told to marry someone  she doesn't want to marry  can now go meet once a month with  a group of people and refuse that  and find life on her own terms. That's the kind of change we have to hope for. PM  Have you been surprised by  the global nature of the message  Because I think when the book first  came out  many people thought  well  this is a really important handbook  for young women on their way up. They need to look at this  anticipate  the barriers  and recognize them  put them out in the open  have the dialogue about it  but that it's really for women who are that.  Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world. And yet the book is being read  as you  say  in rural and developing countries. What part of that has surprised you  and  perhaps led to a new perspective on your part  SS  The book is about self confidence   and about equality. And it turns out  everywhere in the world   women need more self confidence  because the world tells us we're not equal to men. Everywhere in the world  we live in  a world where the men get  and   and women get  or.  I've never met a man who's been  asked how he does it all.  Laughter  Again  I'm going to turn to the men in the audience  Please raise your hand if you've  been asked  how do you do it all  Men only. Women  women. Please raise your hand  if you've been asked how you do it all  We assume men can do it all   slash    have jobs and children. We assume women can't  and that's ridiculous  because the great majority of women everywhere  in the world  including the United States  work full time and have children. And I think people don't fully understand  how broad the message is. There is a circle that's been started  for rescued sex workers in Miami. They're using  Lean In  to help  people make the transition back to what would be a fair life  really rescuing  them from their pimps  and using it. There are dress for success groups  in Texas which are using the book  for women who have never been to college. And we know there are groups  all the way to Ethiopia. And so these messages of equality    of how women  are told they can't have what men can have    how we assume that leadership is for men   how we assume that voice is for men  these affect all of us  and I  think they are very universal. And it's part of what TEDWomen does. It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in  which is more women  more voice  more equality. PM  If you were invited now to  make another TEDWomen talk  what would you say that is a result  of this experience  for you personally  and what you've learned about women  and men  as you've made this journey  SS  I think I would say    I tried to say this strongly  but I think I can say it more strongly    I want to say that the status quo is not enough. That it's not good enough  that it's  not changing quickly enough. Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book   another year of data came out from the U.S. Census. And you know what we found  No movement in the wage gap  for women in the United States. Seventy seven cents to the dollar. If you are a black woman     cents. If you are a Latina  we're at    cents. Do you know when the last  time those numbers went up      . We are stagnating  we are  stagnating in so many ways. And I think we are not really being honest about that  for so many reasons. It's so  hard to talk about gender. We shy away from the word  feminist    a word I really think we need to embrace. We have to get rid of the  word bossy and bring back    I think I would say in a louder voice   we need to get rid of the word  bossy  and bring back the word  feminist    because we need it. PM  And we all need to do a lot more leaning in. SS  A lot more leaning in. PM  Thank you  Sheryl. Thanks for leaning in and saying yes. SS  Thank you. Two years ago  I have to say there was no problem. Two years ago  I knew exactly  what an icon looked like. It looks like this. Everybody's icon  but also the default position of a curator of Italian Renaissance  paintings  which I was then. And in a way  this is also another default selection. Leonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image of the  Lady with an Ermine.  And I use that word  soulful  deliberately. Or then there's this  or rather these  the two versions of Leonardo's  Virgin of the Rocks  that were about to come together  in London for the very first time. In the exhibition that I was then in  the absolute throes of organizing. I was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo  and I had been for three years. So  he was occupying every part of my brain. Leonardo had taught me  during that three years  about what a picture can do. About taking you from your own  material world into a spiritual world. He said  actually  that he believed  the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible  and invisible in the universe. That's a huge task. And yet   somehow he achieves it. He shows us  I think  the human soul. He shows us the capacity of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm. To see a vision of the universe that's  more perfect than our own. To see God's own plan  in some sense. So this  in a sense  was really  what I believed an icon was. At about that time  I started talking to Tom Campbell  director here of the Metropolitan Museum  about what my next move might be. The move  in fact  back to an earlier life  one I'd begun at the British Museum  back to the world of three dimensions    of sculpture and of decorative arts    to take over the department of European sculpture  and decorative arts  here at the Met. But it was an incredibly busy time. All the conversations were done  at very peculiar times of the day    over the phone. In the end  I accepted the job without actually having been here. Again  I'd been there a couple of years before  but on that particular visit. So  it was just before the time that  the Leonardo show was due to open when I finally made it back to the Met  to New York  to see my new domain. To see what European sculpture  and decorative arts looked like  beyond those Renaissance collections  with which I was so already familiar. And I thought  on that very first day   I better tour the galleries. Fifty seven of these galleries    like    varieties of baked beans  I believe. I walked through and I started in my comfort zone in the Italian Renaissance. And then I moved gradually around  feeling a little lost sometimes. My head  also still full of the Leonardo exhibition that was about to open  and I came across this. And I thought to myself  What the hell have I done  There was absolutely no connection in my mind at all and  in fact  if there was any emotion going on  it was a kind of repulsion. This object felt utterly and completely alien. Silly at a level that I hadn't yet  understood silliness to be. And then it was made worse    there were two of them. So  I started thinking about why it was  in fact  that I disliked this object so much. What was the anatomy of my distaste  Well  so much gold  so vulgar. You know  so nouveau riche  frankly. Leonardo himself had preached  against the use of gold  so it was absolutely anathema at that moment. And then there's little pretty sprigs  of flowers everywhere.  Laughter  And finally  that pink. That damned pink. It's such an extraordinarily artificial color. I mean  it's a color that I can't think of  anything that you actually see in nature  that looks that shade. The object even has its own tutu.  Laughter  This little flouncy  spangly  bottomy bit that sits at the bottom of the vase. It reminded me  in an odd kind of way  of my niece's fifth birthday party. Where all the little girls would come  either as a princess or a fairy. There was one who would come as a fairy princess. You should have seen the looks. And I realize that this object was in my mind  born from the same mind  from the same womb  practically  as Barbie Ballerina.  Laughter  And then there's the elephants.  Laughter  Those extraordinary elephants with their little  sort of strange  sinister expressions and Greta Garbo eyelashes  with  these golden tusks and so on. I realized this was an elephant that had absolutely nothing to do with a majestic  march across the Serengeti. It was a Dumbo nightmare.  Laughter  But something more profound  was happening as well. These objects  it seemed to me  were quintessentially the kind that I  and my liberal left friends in London had always seen as summing up something deplorable about the French aristocracy in the   th century. The label had told me that these pieces were made by the S vres Manufactory  made of porcelain in the late     s  and designed by a designer called  Jean Claude Duplessis  actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as I later learned. But for me  they summed up a kind of  that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy in the   th century. I and my colleagues had always thought that these objects  in way  summed up the idea of  you know    no wonder there was a revolution. Or  indeed  thank God there was a revolution. There was a sort of idea really  that  if you owned a vase like this  then there was really only one fate possible. So  there I was    in a sort of paroxysm of horror. But I took the job and I went  on looking at these vases. I sort of had to because they're  on a through route in the Met. So  almost anywhere I went  there they were. They had this kind of odd sort of fascination  like a car accident. Where I couldn't stop looking. And as I did so  I started thinking  Well  what are we actually looking at here  And what I started with was understanding this as really a supreme piece of design. It took me a little time. But  that tutu for example    actually  this is a piece that  does dance in its own way. It has an extraordinary lightness and yet  it is also amazing balanced. It has these kinds of sculptural ingredients. And then the play between    actually really quite carefully disposed  color and gilding  and the sculptural surface  is really rather remarkable. And then I realized that this piece went into the kiln four times  at least four times  in order to arrive at this. How many moments for accident can you think of that could have happened to this piece  And then remember  not just one  but two. So he's having to arrive at two exactly matched vases of this kind. And then this question of uselessness. Well actually  the end of the trunks  were originally candle holders. So what you would have had  were candles on either side. Imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface. On the slightly uneven pink  on the beautiful gold. It would have glittered in an interior  a little like a little firework. And at that point  actually   a firework went off in my brain. Somebody reminded me that  that word 'fancy'    which in a sense for me  encapsulated this object    actually comes from the same  root as the word 'fantasy.' And that what this object was just as much in a way  in its own way  as a Leonardo da Vinci painting  is a portal to somewhere else. This is an object of the imagination. If you think about the mad   th century  operas of the time    set in the Orient. If you think about divans and perhaps even  opium induced visions of pink elephants  then at that point  this object starts to make sense. This is an object which is all about escapism. It's about an escapism that happens    that the aristocracy in France sought very deliberately to distinguish themselves from ordinary people. It's not an escapism that we feel particularly happy with today  however. And again  going on thinking about this  I realize that in a way we're all victims of a certain kind of tyranny of the triumph of modernism whereby form and function in an object have to follow one another  or are deemed to do so. And the extraneous ornament is seen as really  essentially  criminal. It's a triumph  in a way  of bourgeois values rather than aristocratic ones. And that seems fine. Except for the fact that it becomes a kind of  sequestration of imagination. So just as in the   th century  so many people had the idea that their faith took place on the Sabbath day  and the rest of their lives    their lives of washing machines and orthodontics    took place on another day. Then  I think we've started doing the same. We've allowed ourselves to lead our fantasy lives in front of screens. In the dark of the cinema  with the television in the corner of the room. We've eliminated  in a sense  that constant of the imagination that these vases  represented in people's lives. So maybe it's time we got this back a little. I think it's beginning to happen. In London  for example  with these extraordinary buildings that have been appearing over the last few years. Redolent  in a sense  of science fiction  turning London into a kind of fantasy playground. It's actually amazing to look out of  a high building nowadays there. But even then  there's a resistance. London has called these buildings the  Gherkin  the Shard  the Walkie Talkie    bringing these soaring buildings down to Earth. There's an idea that we don't want these anxious making  imaginative journeys  to happen in our daily lives. I feel lucky in a way  I've encountered this object. I found him on the Internet when  I was looking up a reference. And there he was. And unlike the pink elephant vase  this was a kind of love at first sight. In fact  reader  I married him. I bought him. And he now adorns my office. He's a Staffordshire figure made  in the middle of the   th century. He represents the actor  Edmund Kean   playing Shakespeare's Richard III. And it's based  actually  on a more  elevated piece of porcelain. So I loved  on an art historical level  I loved that layered quality that he has. But more than that  I love him. In a way that I think would have been impossible without the pink S vres vase in my Leonardo days. I love his orange and pink breeches. I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war  having just finished the washing up.  Laughter  He seems also to have forgotten his sword. I love his pink little cheeks  his munchkin energy. In a way  he's become my sort of alter ego. He's  I hope  a little bit dignified  but mostly rather vulgar.  Laughter  And energetic  I hope  too. I let him into my life because the S vres pink elephant vase allowed me to do so. And before that Leonardo  I understood that this object could become  part of a journey for me every day  sitting in my office. I really hope that others  all of you  visiting objects in the museum  and taking them home and  finding them for yourselves  will allow those objects to flourish  in your imaginative lives. Thank you very much. My job is to design  build and study robots that communicate with people. But this story doesn't start with robotics at all  it starts with animation. When I first saw Pixar's  Luxo Jr.   I was amazed by how much emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp. I mean  look at them    at the end of this movie  you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture. And I said  I have to learn how to do this. So I made a really bad career decision. And that's what my mom was like when I did it. I left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company and I moved to New York to study animation. And there I lived in a collapsing apartment building in Harlem with roommates. I'm not using this phrase metaphorically    the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room. Whenever they did news stories about building violations in New York  they would put the report in front of our building  as kind of  like  a backdrop to show how bad things are. Anyway  during the day  I went to school and at night I would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation. And I learned two surprising lessons. One of them was that when you want to arouse emotions  it doesn't matter so much how something looks  it's all in the motion  in the timing of how the thing moves. And the second was something one of our teachers told us. He actually did the weasel in  Ice Age.  And he said   As an animator  you're not a director    you're an actor.  So  if you want to find the right motion for a character  don't think about it    go use your body to find it. Stand in front of a mirror  act it out in front of a camera    whatever you need    and then put it back in your character. A year later I found myself at MIT in the Robotic Life Group. It was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots. And I still had this dream to make an actual  physical Luxo Jr. lamp. But I found that robots didn't move at all in this engaging way that I was used to from my animation studies. Instead  they were all    how should I put it    they were all kind of robotic. And I thought  what if I took whatever I learned in animation school  and used that to design my robotic desk lamp. So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible. And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop    and I'm actually redesigning the robot  so  unbeknownst to itself  it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me. I wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light  and more of a helpful  kind of quiet apprentice that's always there when you need it and doesn't really interfere. And when  for example  I'm looking for a battery that I can't find  in a subtle way  it'll show me where the battery is. So you can see my confusion here. I'm not an actor. And I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure can  at one point  just by the way it moves  seem gentle and caring and in the other case  seem violent and confrontational. And it's the same structure  just the motion is different. Actor   You want to know something  Well  you want to know something  He was already dead  Just laying there  eyes glazed over   But  moving in a graceful way is just one building block of this whole structure called human robot interaction. I was  at the time  doing my PhD  I was working on human robot teamwork  teams of humans and robots working together. I was studying the engineering  the psychology  the philosophy of teamwork  and at the same time  I found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation  with a good friend of mine  who's actually here. And in that situation  we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us. It was after a Passover Seder. We were folding up a lot of folding chairs  and I was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm. Everybody did their own part  we didn't have to divide our tasks. We didn't have to communicate verbally about this    it all just happened. And I thought  humans and robots don't look at all like this. When humans and robots interact  it's much more like a chess game  the human does a thing  the robot analyzes whatever the human did  the robot decides what to do next  plans it and does it. Then the human waits  until it's their turn again. So it's much more like a chess game  and that makes sense  because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists. It's all about information  analysis  decision making and planning. But I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player  and more like a doer that just clicks and works together. So I made my second horrible career choice  I decided to study acting for a semester. I took off from the PhD  I went to acting classes. I actually participated in a play    I hope there s no video of that around still. And I got every book I could find about acting  including one from the   th century that I got from the library. And I was really amazed  because my name was the second name on the list    the previous name was in     . And this book was kind of waiting for     years to be rediscovered for robotics. And this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express. But the real revelation was when I learned about method acting. It became very popular in the   th century. And method acting said you don't have to plan every muscle in your body  instead  you have to use your body to find the right movement. You have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression    improvise  play off your scene partner. And this came at the same time as I was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology  called embodied cognition  which also talks about the same ideas. We use our bodies to think  we don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move  but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave. And it was like a lightning bolt. I went back to my office  I wrote this paper  which I never really published  called  Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence.  And I even took another month to do what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together. That's what you saw before with the actors. And I thought  How can we make an artificial intelligence model    a computer  computational model    that will model some of these ideas of improvisation  of taking risks  of taking chances  even of making mistakes  Maybe it can make for better robotic teammates. So I worked for quite a long time on these models and I implemented them on a number of robots. Here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence to try to match my movements as closely as possible. It's sort of like a game. Let's look at it. You can see when I psych it out  it gets fooled. And it's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them. And then  I did another experiment  and I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp  and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence. So  I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot. The robot is the same lamp that you saw  and I put two brains in it. For one half of the people  I put in a brain that's kind of the traditional  calculated robotic brain. It waits for its turn  it analyzes everything  it plans. Let's call it the calculated brain. The other got more the stage actor  risk taker brain. Let's call it the adventurous brain. It sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know. It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them. And I had them do this very tedious task that took almost    minutes  and they had to work together  somehow simulating  like  a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing. What I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot. They thought it was more intelligent  more committed  a better member of the team  contributed to the success of the team more. They even called it  he  and  she   whereas people with the calculated brain called it  it   and nobody ever called it  he  or  she.  When they talked about it after the task  with the adventurous brain  they said   By the end  we were good friends and high fived mentally.  Whatever that means. Sounds painful. Whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy apprentice. It only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more  which is almost what people expect robots to do  so I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing. And in a way  I thought  maybe it's time    just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the   th century  from going from the very calculated  planned way of behaving  to a more intuitive  risk taking  embodied way of behaving    maybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution. A few years later  I was at my next research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta  and I was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians. And I thought  music  that's the perfect place to look at teamwork  coordination  timing  improvisation    and we just got this robot playing marimba. And the marimba  for everybody like me  it was this huge  wooden xylophone. And when I was looking at this  I looked at other works in human robot improvisation    yes  there are other works in human robot improvisation    and they were also a little bit like a chess game. The human would play  the robot analyzed what was played  and would improvise their own part. So  this is what musicians called a call and response interaction  and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence. But I thought  if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies  maybe I can make the robots jam together like a band. Everybody's riffing off each other  nobody is stopping for a moment. And so I tried to do the same things  this time with music  where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play  it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play  and does what my jazz teacher when I was    taught me. She said  when you improvise  sometimes you don't know what you're doing  and you still do it. So I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually know what it's doing  but is still doing it. So let's look at a few seconds from this performance  where the robot listens to the human musician and improvises. And then  look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its behavior  and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with. Being a musician is not just about making notes  otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show. Musicians also communicate with their bodies  with other band members  with the audience  they use their bodies to express the music. And I thought  we already have a robot musician on stage  why not make it be a full fledged musician  And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot. The head doesn t actually touch the marimba  it just expresses what the music is like. These are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta that was dangerously located exactly halfway between my lab and my home. So I spent  I would say  on average  three to four hours a day there. I think. And I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like  but especially what a robotic musician would move like  to sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing    and maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment. So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot  which was nice. I'm going to show you now the same kind of performance  this time with a socially expressive head. And notice one thing    how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human  while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing. And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo. Now it's looking at me  showing that it's listening. Now look at the final chord of the piece again. And this time the robot communicates with its body when it's busy doing its own thing  and when it's ready to coordinate the final chord with me. Thanks. I hope you see how much this part of the body that doesn't touch the instrument actually helps with the musical performance. And at some point    we are in Atlanta  so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point    and we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot. Here you can see the robot basically responding to the beat. Notice two things  one  how irresistible it is to join the robot while it's moving its head. You kind of want to move your own head when it does it. And second  even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone  as soon as the robot turns to him  he turns back. So even though it's just in the periphery of his vision  in the corner of his eye  it's very powerful. And the reason is that we can't ignore physical things moving in our environment. We are wired for that. So if you have a problem    maybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much    you might want to have a robot there to get their attention. Just to introduce the last robot that we've worked on  it came out of something surprising that we found  Some point people didn't care about the robot being intelligent  able to improvise and listen  and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years developing. They really liked that the robot was enjoying the music. And they didn't say the robot was moving to the music  they said  enjoying  the music. And we thought  why don't we take this idea  and I designed a new piece of furniture. This time it wasn't a desk lamp  it was a speaker dock  one of those things you plug your smartphone in. And I thought  what would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you  but would actually enjoy it  too  And so again  here are some animation tests from an early stage. And this is what the final product looked like. So  a lot of bobbing heads. A lot of bobbing heads in the audience  so we can still see robots influence people. And it's not just fun and games. I think one of the reasons I care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body to move is    I'm going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding    is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your life. Somewhere in your future  there will be a robot in your life. If not in yours  your children's lives. And I want these robots to be more fluent  more engaging  more graceful than currently they seem to be. And for that I think maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians. Maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise. Maybe they should be able to anticipate what you're about to do. Maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them  because in the end  we are human. And maybe as humans  robots that are a little less than perfect are just perfect for us. Thank you. So when I was in Morocco  in Casablanca  not so long ago  I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza. Faiza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception  pregnancy  and delivery. It was a remarkable tale  but Faiza saved the best for last.  You know  I am a virgin   she told me.  I have two medical certificates to prove it.  This is the modern Middle East  where two millennia after the coming of Christ  virgin births are still a fact of life. Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard  over the years  traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex. Now  I know this might sound like a dream job  or possibly a highly dubious occupation  but for me  it's something else altogether. I'm half Egyptian  and I'm Muslim. But I grew up in Canada  far from my Arab roots. Like so many who straddle East and West  I've been drawn  over the years  to try to better understand my origins. That I chose to look at sex comes from  my background in HIV AIDS  as a writer and a researcher and an activist. Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa  which is one of only two regions in the world where HIV AIDS is still on the rise. Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society  because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage  in politics and economics  in religion and tradition   in gender and generations. As I found  if you really want to know a people  you start by looking inside their bedrooms. Now to be sure  the Arab world is vast and varied. But running across it are three red lines    these are topics you are not supposed  to challenge in word or deed. The first of these is politics. But the Arab Spring has changed all that  in uprisings which have blossomed  across the region since     . Now while those in power  old and new  continue to cling to business as usual  millions are still pushing back  and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life. That second red line is religion. But now religion and politics are connected  with the rise of such groups as the  Muslim Brotherhood. And some people  at least  are starting  to ask questions about the role of Islam in public and private life. You know  as for that third red line   that off limits subject  what do you think it might be  Audience  Sex. Shereen El Feki  Louder  I can't hear you. Audience  Sex. SEF  Again  please don't be shy. Audience  Sex. SEF  Absolutely  that's right  it's sex.  Laughter  Across the Arab region  the only accepted context for sex is marriage    approved by your parents  sanctioned by religion and registered by the state. Marriage is your ticket to adulthood. If you don't tie the knot  you can't  move out of your parents' place  and you're not supposed to be having sex  and you're definitely not supposed  to be having children. It's a social citadel  it's an impregnable fortress which resists any assault  any alternative. And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex  against condoms  against abortion  against homosexuality  you name it. Faiza was living proof of this. Her virginity statement was  not a piece of wishful thinking. Although the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity  in a patriarchy  boys will be boys. Men have sex before marriage  and people more or less turn a blind eye. Not so for women  who are expected to be virgins  on their wedding night    that is  to turn up with your hymen intact. This is not a question of individual concern  this is a matter of family honor   and in particular  men's honor. And so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve  this tiny piece of anatomy    from female genital mutilation  to virginity testing  to hymen repair surgery. Faiza chose a different route  non vaginal sex. Only she became pregnant all the same. But Faiza didn't actually realize this  because there's so little  sexuality education in schools  and so little communication in the family. When her condition became hard to hide  Faiza's mother helped her flee  her father and brothers. This is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the Arab region. And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at  a hospital in Casablanca  the man who offered to help her  instead tried to rape her. Sadly  Faiza is not alone. In Egypt  where my research is focused  I have seen plenty of trouble  in and out of the citadel. There are legions of young men who can't afford to get married  because marriage has become  a very expensive proposition. They are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life  but they can't find jobs. This is one of the major drivers  of the recent uprisings  and it is one of the reasons for the  rising age of marriage in much of the Arab region. There are career women who want to get married  but can't find a husband  because they defy gender expectations  or as one young female doctor  in Tunisia put it to me   The women  they are becoming more and more open. But the man  he is still at the prehistoric stage.  And then there are men and women who  cross the heterosexual line  who have sex with their own sex  or who have a different gender identity. They are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities  even their appearance. And they face a daily struggle with social stigma  with family despair  and with religious fire and brimstone. Now  it's not as if it's all rosy  in the marital bed either. Couples who are looking for greater happiness  greater sexual happiness in their married lives  but are at a loss of how to achieve it  especially wives  who are afraid  of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom. And then there are those whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution. They have been sold by their families  often to wealthy Arab tourists. This is just one face of a booming  sex trade across the Arab region. Now raise your hand if any of  this is sounding familiar to you  from your part of the world. Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups. And although we don't yet have an Arab Kinsey Report to tell us exactly what's happening  inside bedrooms across the Arab region  It's pretty clear that  something is not right. Double standards for men and women  sex as a source of shame  family control limiting individual choices  and a vast gulf between appearance and reality  what people are doing and what they're willing to admit to  and a general reluctance to move  beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion. As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me   Here  sex is the opposite of sport. Football  everybody talks about it  but hardly anyone plays. But sex  everybody is doing it  but nobody wants to talk about it.   Laughter  SEF  I want to give you a piece of advice  which if you follow it  will make you happy in life. When your husband reaches out to you  when he seizes a part of your body  sigh deeply and look at him lustily. When he penetrates you with his penis  try to talk flirtatiously and  move yourself in harmony with him. Hot stuff  And it might sound that these handy hints come from  The Joy of Sex  or YouPorn. But in fact  they come from a   th century Arabic book called  The Encyclopedia of Pleasure   which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia  and everything in between. The Encyclopedia is just one  in a long line of Arabic erotica  much of it written by religious scholars. Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad  there is a rich tradition in Islam of talking frankly about sex  not just its problems  but also its pleasures  and not just for men  but also for women. A thousand years ago  we used to have  whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic. Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature  position and preference  a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body  of the woman you see on this page. Today  this history is largely unknown  in the Arab region. Even by educated people  who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue. Today's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America on the brink of the sexual revolution. But while the West has opened on sex  what we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction. In Egypt and many of its neighbors  this closing down is part of a wider closing in political  social and cultural thought. And it is the product of a complex historical process  one which has gained ground with the rise  of Islamic conservatism since the late     s.  Just say no  is what conservatives  around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo. In the Arab region  they brand these attempts as a Western conspiracy to undermine traditional Arab and Islamic values. But what's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of control  sex wrapped up in religion. But history shows us that  even as recently as our fathers' and grandfathers' day  there have been times of greater pragmatism  and tolerance  and a willingness to consider other interpretations  be it abortion  or masturbation  or even  the incendiary topic of homosexuality. It is not black and white  as conservatives would have us believe. In these  as in so many other matters  Islam offers us at least    shades of gray. Over my travels  I've met men and women  across the Arab region who've been exploring that spectrum    sexologists who are trying to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages  innovators who are managing to get  sexuality education into schools  small groups of men and women  lesbian  gay  transgendered  transsexual  who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real world support. Women  and increasingly men  who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home. Groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against HIV and other occupational hazards  and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza find a place in society  and critically  stay with their kids. Now these efforts are small   they're often underfunded  and they face formidable opposition. But I am optimistic that  in the long run  times are changing  and they and their ideas will gain ground. Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region through dramatic confrontation  beating or indeed baring of breasts  but rather through negotiation. What we're talking here is not about a  sexual revolution  but a sexual evolution   learning from other parts of the world  adapting to local conditions  forging our own path  not following one blazed by another. That path  I hope  will one day lead us  to the right to control our own bodies  and to access the information  and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives. The right to express our ideas freely  to marry whom we choose   to choose our own partners  to be sexually active or not  to decide whether to have children and when  all this without violence or force or discrimination. Now we are very far from this  across the Arab region  and so much needs to change  law  education  media  the economy  the list goes on and on  and it is the work of a generation  at least. But it begins with a journey that I myself have made  asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life. And it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith  and my appreciation of local histories and cultures by showing me possibilities  where I once only saw absolutes. Now given the turmoil in many countries in the Arab region  talking about sex   challenging the taboos  seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury. But at this critical moment in history  if we do not anchor freedom and justice  dignity and equality  privacy and autonomy in our personal lives  in our sexual lives  we will find it very hard to achieve in public life. The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows  and that is true for us all. no matter where we live and love. Thank you. Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother  Mamar  in our four family home in Brooklyn  New York. Her apartment was an oasis. It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee  which was really warm milk  with just a touch of caffeine. She loved life. And although she worked in a factory  she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe. And I remember poring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music. And then  when I was eight and she was     something changed. She no longer worked or traveled. She no longer danced. There were no more coffee times. My mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn't make a diagnosis. And my father  who worked at night   would spend every afternoon with her  just to make sure she ate. Her care became all consuming for our family. And by the time a diagnosis was made  she was in a deep spiral. Now many of you will recognize her symptoms. My grandmother had depression. A deep  life altering depression  from which she never recovered. And back then  so little  was known about depression. But even today     years later  there's still so much more to learn. Today  we know that women  are    percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men. And even with this high prevalence  women are misdiagnosed between     and    percent of the time. Now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms  of fatigue  sleep disturbance  pain and anxiety compared with men. And these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression. And it isn't only depression in which  these sex differences occur  but they occur across so many diseases. So it's my grandmother's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest. And today  I lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women. Today  we know that every cell has a sex. Now  that's a term coined  by the Institute of Medicine. And what it means is that  men and women are different down to the cellular and molecular levels. It means that we're different  across all of our organs. From our brains to our hearts  our lungs  our joints. Now  it was only    years ago that we hardly had any data on women's health beyond our reproductive functions. But then in       the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law. And what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities  be included in clinical trials that were funded by the National Institutes of Health. And in many ways  the law has worked. Women are now routinely  included in clinical studies  and we've learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease. But remarkably  what we have learned about these  differences is often overlooked. So  we have to ask ourselves the question  Why leave women's health to chance  And we're leaving it to chance in two ways. The first is that there is so much more to learn and we're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent  of these sex differences. And the second is that we aren't  taking what we have learned  and routinely applying it in clinical care. We are just not doing enough. So  I'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have  impacted the health of women  and where we need to do more. Let's start with heart disease. It's the number one killer of women  in the United States today. This is the face of heart disease. Linda is a middle aged woman  who had a stent placed in one of the arteries going to her heart. When she had recurring symptoms  she went back to her doctor. Her doctor did the gold standard test  a cardiac catheterization. It showed no blockages. Linda's symptoms continued. She had to stop working. And that's when she found us. When Linda came to us  we did  another cardiac catheterization and this time  we found clues. But we needed another test to make the diagnosis. So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound  where you use soundwaves to look at the artery from the inside out. And what we found was that Linda's disease didn't look like the typical male disease. The typical male disease looks like this. There's a discrete blockage or stenosis. Linda's disease  like the disease of so many women  looks like this. The plaque is laid down more evenly  more diffusely along the artery  and it's harder to see. So for Linda  and for so many women  the gold standard test wasn't gold. Now  Linda received the right treatment. She went back to her life and  fortunately  today she is doing well. But Linda was lucky. She found us  we found her disease. But for too many women  that's not the case. We have the tools. We have the technology to make the diagnosis. But it's all too often that these sex diffferences are overlooked. So what about treatment  A landmark study that was published two years ago asked the very important question  What are the most effective treatments  for heart disease in women  The authors looked at papers  written over a    year period  and hundreds had to be thrown out. And what they found out was that  of those that were tossed out     percent were excluded because even though women  were included in the studies  the analysis didn't differentiate  between women and men. What a lost opportunity. The money had been spent and we didn't learn how women fared. And these studies could not contribute one iota to the very  very important question  what are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women  I want to introduce you to  Hortense  my godmother  Hung Wei  a relative of a colleague  and somebody you may recognize    Dana  Christopher Reeve's wife. All three women have something  very important in common. All three were diagnosed with lung cancer  the number one cancer killer of women in the United States today. All three were nonsmokers. Sadly  Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease. Today  what we know is that women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men who are nonsmokers. Now interestingly  when women are  diagnosed with lung cancer  their survival tends to be better than that of men. Now  here are some clues. Our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor  cells of both women and men. And these genes are activated mainly by estrogen. And when these genes are over expressed  it's associated with improved survival only in young women. Now this is a very early finding and we don't yet know whether it has relevance to clinical care. But it's findings like this that may provide hope and may provide an opportunity to save lives of both women and men. Now  let me share with you an example of when we do consider sex differences  it can drive the science. Several years ago a new lung cancer drug was being evaluated  and when the authors looked  at whose tumors shrank  they found that    percent were women. This led them to ask the question  Well  why  And what they found was that the genetic mutations  that the drug targeted were far more common in women. And what this has led to is a more personalized approach to the treatment of lung cancer  that also includes sex. This is what we can accomplish when we don't leave women's health to chance. We know that when you invest in research  you get results. Take a look at the death rate  from breast cancer over time. And now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time. Now let's look at the dollars  invested in breast cancer    these are the dollars invested per death    and the dollars invested in lung cancer. Now  it's clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results. They may not be fast enough  but it has produced results. We can do the same for lung cancer and for every other disease. So let's go back to depression. Depression is the number one cause of disability in women in the world today. Our investigators have found that there are differences in the brains of women and men in the areas that are connected with mood. And when you put men and women in a functional MRI scanner    that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated    so you put them in the scanner  and you expose them to stress. You can actually see the difference. And it's findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why we see these very significant sex differences in depression. But even though we know that these differences occur     percent of the brain research that begins in animals is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified. So  I think we have to ask again the question  Why leave women's health to chance  And this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge  of being able to dramatically improve the health of women. We know that every cell has a sex. We know that these differences  are often overlooked. And therefore we know that women  are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today. We have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum. Women's health is an equal rights issue as important as equal pay. And it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine. So imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these  sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research. Or if we analyzed our data by sex. So  people often ask me  What can I do  And here's what I suggest  First  I suggest that you think about women's health in the same way that you think and care about other  causes that are important to you. And second  and equally as important  that as a woman  you have to ask your doctor and the doctors who are caring  for those who you love  Is this disease or treatment different in women  Now  this is a profound question  because the answer is likely yes  but your doctor may not know  the answer  at least not yet. But if you ask the question   your doctor will very likely go looking for the answer. And this is so important  not only for ourselves  but for all of those whom we love. Whether it be a mother  a daughter  a sister  a friend or a grandmother. It was my grandmother's suffering that inspired my work to improve the health of women. That's her legacy. Our legacy can be to improve the health of women for this generation and for generations to come. Thank you. I have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas  Why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where I work  I have worked with more than     companies. Despite all the technological advances    computers  I.T.  communications  telecommunications  the Internet. Enigma number two  Why is there so little engagement at work  Why do people feel so miserable  even actively disengaged  Disengaging their colleagues. Acting against the interest of their company. Despite all the affiliation events  the celebration  the people initiatives  the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams. At the beginning  I thought there was a chicken and egg issue  Because people are less engaged   they are less productive. Or vice versa  because they are less productive  we put more pressure and they are less engaged. But as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates  in fact  to the basic  pillars of management. The way we organize is based on two pillars. The hard    structure  processes  systems. The soft    feelings  sentiments  interpersonal relationships  traits  personality. And whenever a company reorganizes  restructures  reengineers  goes through a cultural transformation program  it chooses these two pillars. Now  we try to refine them  we try to combine them. The real issue is    and this is the answer to the two enigmas    these pillars are obsolete. Everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their combination. They are obsolete. How do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business  The hard approach  basically  is that you start from strategy  requirements  structures  processes   systems  KPIs  scorecards  committees  headquarters  hubs  clusters  you name it. I forgot all the metrics  incentives  committees   middle offices and interfaces. What happens basically on the left  you have more complexity  the  new complexity of business. We need quality  cost  reliability  speed. And every time there is a new requirement  we use the same approach. We create dedicated structure processed systems  basically to deal with the  new complexity of business. The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization. Let's take an example. An automotive company  the engineering division is a five dimensional matrix. If you open any cell of the matrix  you find another    dimensional matrix. You have Mr. Noise  Mr. Petrol Consumption  Mr. Anti Collision Properties. For any new requirement  you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement. What happens when the new  requirement emerges  Some years ago  a new requirement appeared on the marketplace  the length of the warranty period. So therefore the new requirement is repairability  making cars easy to repair. Otherwise when you bring the car  to the garage to fix the light  if you have to remove the engine to access the lights  the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours  and the  warranty budget will explode. So  what was the solution using the hard approach  If repairability is the new requirement  the solution is to create a new function  Mr. Repairability. And Mr. Repairability creates  the repairability process. With a repairability scorecard   with a repairability metric and eventually repairability incentive. That came on top of    other KPIs. What percentage of these people is variable compensation  Twenty percent at most  divided by    KPIs  repairability makes a difference of  .  percent. What difference did it make in their actions  their choices to simplify  Zero. But what occurs for zero impact   Mr. Repairability  process  scorecard  evaluation  coordination  with the    other coordinators to have zero impact. Now  in front of the new complexity of business  the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines. It is basically the interplay. How the parts work together. The connections  the interactions  the synapses. It is not the skeleton of boxes   it is the nervous system of adaptiveness and intelligence. You know  you could call it cooperation  basically. Whenever people cooperate  they use less resources. In everything. You know  the repairability issue is a cooperation problem. When you design cars  please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages. When we don't cooperate we need more time  more equipment  more systems  more teams. We need    When procurement  supply  chain  manufacturing don't cooperate we need more stock  more inventories   more working capital. Who will pay for that  Shareholders  Customers  No  they will refuse. So who is left   The employees  who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation. Stress  burnout  they are  overwhelmed  accidents. No wonder they disengage. How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation  The hard  In banks  when there is a problem between the back office and the front office  they don't cooperate. What is the solution  They create a middle office. What happens one year later  Instead of one problem  between the back and the front  now I have two problems. Between the back and the middle and between the middle and the front. Plus I have to pay for the middle office. The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation. It can only add new boxes   new bones in the skeleton. The soft approach  To make people cooperate  we need  to make them like each other. Improve interpersonal feelings  the more people like each other   the more they will cooperate. It is totally wrong. It is even counterproductive. Look  at home I have two TVs. Why  Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife. Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife. And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because I love my wife. If I didn't love my wife  one TV would be enough  You will watch my favorite football game  if you are not happy  how is the book or the door  The more we like each other  the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships  by imposing tough tradeoffs. And we go for a second TV or we escalate the decision above for arbitration. Definitely  these approaches are obsolete. To deal with complexity  to enhance the nervous system  we have created what we call  the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules. Simple rule number one  Understand what others do. What is their real work  We need to go beyond the boxes  the job descriptions  beyond the surface of the container  to understand the real content. Me  designer  if I put a wire here  I know that it will mean that we will have to remove the engine to access the lights. Second  you need to reenforce integrators. Integrators are not middle  offices  they are managers  existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate. How can you reinforce your  managers as integrators  By removing layers. When there are too many layers people are too far from the action  therefore they need KPIs  metrics  they need poor proxies for reality. They don't understand reality and they add the complicatedness of metrics  KPIs. By removing rules    the bigger we are  the more we need integrators  therefore the less rules we must have  to give discretionary power to managers. And we do the opposite    the bigger we are  the more rules we create. And we end up with the Encyclopedia  Britannica of rules. You need to increase the quanitity of power so that you can empower everybody to use their judgment  their intelligence. You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate  to move out of insulation. Otherwise  they will withdraw. They will disengage. These rules  they come from game theory and organizational sociology. You can increase the shadow of the future. Create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions. This is what the automotive company did when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact. They said to the design engineers  Now  in three years  when the new  car is launched on the market  you will move to the after sales  network  and become in charge of the warranty budget  and if the warranty budget explodes  it will explode in your face.  Laughter  Much more powerful than  .   percent variable compensation. You need also to increase reciprocity  by removing the buffers that make us self sufficient. When you remove these buffers  you hold me by the nose  I hold you by the ear. We will cooperate. Remove the second TV. There are many second TVs at work that don't create value  they just provide dysfunctional self sufficiency. You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate. The CEO of The Lego Group  Jorgen Vig Knudstorp  has a great way to use it. He says  blame is not for failure  it is for failing to help or ask for help. It changes everything. Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses  my real forecast  because I know I will not be blamed if I fail  but if I fail to help or ask for help. When you do this  it has a lot of implications on organizational design. You stop drawing boxes  dotted lines  full lines  you look at their interplay. It has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use. On human resource management practices. When you do that  you can manage complexity  the new complexity of business  without getting complicated. You create more value with lower cost. You simultaneously improve  performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both. Complicatedness  This is your  battle  business leaders. The real battle is not against competitors. This is rubbish  very abstract. When do we meet competitors to fight them  The real battle is against ourselves  against our bureaucracy  our complicatedness. Only you can fight  can do it. Thank you. Joe Kowan  I have stage fright. I've always had stage fright  and not just a little bit  it's a big bit. And it didn't even matter until I was   . That's when I started writing songs  and even then I only played them for myself. Just knowing my roommates were in the  same house made me uncomfortable. But after a couple of years   just writing songs wasn't enough. I had all these stories and ideas  and I wanted to share them with people  but physiologically  I couldn't do it. I had this irrational fear. But the more I wrote  and the more I practiced  the more I wanted to perform. So on the week of my   th birthday  I decided I was going to go to this local open mic  and put this fear behind me. Well  when I got there  it was packed. There were like    people there. And they all looked angry. But I took a deep breath  and I signed up to play  and I felt pretty good. Pretty good  until about    minutes before my turn  when my whole body rebelled  and  this wave of anxiety just washed over me. Now  when you experience fear   your sympathetic nervous system kicks in. So you have a rush of adrenaline   your heart rate increases  your breathing gets faster. Next your non essential systems start  to shut down  like digestion.  Laughter  So your mouth gets dry  and blood is routed away from your extremities  so your fingers don't work anymore. Your pupils dilate  your muscles contract  your Spidey sense tingles  basically your whole body is trigger happy.  Laughter  That condition is not conducive  to performing folk music. I mean  your nervous system is an idiot. Really  Two hundred thousand years of human evolution  and it still can't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and    folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic  I have never been more terrified    until now. So then it was my turn  and somehow  I get myself onto  the stage  I start my song  I open my mouth to sing the first line  and this completely horrible vibrato    you know  when your voice wavers     comes streaming out. And this is not the good kind of vibrato   like an opera singer has  this is my whole body just convulsing with fear. I mean  it's a nightmare. I'm embarrassed  the audience  is clearly uncomfortable  they're focused on my discomfort. It was so bad. But that was my first real experience  as a solo singer songwriter. And something good did happen    I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for. And I wanted more. But I knew  I had to get past this nervousness. That night I promised myself   I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore. And I did. I went back every single week  and sure enough  week after week  it didn't get any better. The same  thing happened every week.  Laughter  I couldn't shake it. And that's when I had an epiphany. And I remember it really well  because I  don't have a lot of epiphanies.  Laughter  All I had to do was write a song  that exploits my nervousness. That only seems authentic when I have stage fright  and the more nervous I was  the better the song would be. Easy. So I started writing a song about having stage fright. First  fessing up to the problem  the physical manifestations  how I would feel  how the listener might feel. And then accounting for things like my shaky voice  and I knew I would be singing about a  half octave higher than normal  because I was nervous. By having a song that explained  what was happening to me  while it was happening  that gave the audience permission to think about it. They didn't have to feel bad  for me because I was nervous  they could experience that with me  and we were all one big happy  nervous   uncomfortable family.  Laughter  By thinking about my audience   by embracing and exploiting my problem  I was able to take something  that was blocking my progress  and turn it into something that  was essential for my success. And having the stage fright song let  me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance. And then I could move on   and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease. And eventually  over time  I didn't  have to play the stage fright song at all. Except for when I was really  nervous  like now.  Laughter  Would it be okay if I played the  stage fright song for you  Can I have a sip of water  Thank you.   I'm not joking  you know      this stage fright is real.     And if I'm up here trembling and singing      well  you'll know how I feel.     And the mistake I'd be making      the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking.     As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me      well  you don't have to be.     Well  maybe just a little bit.     And maybe I'll try to imagine  you all without clothes.     But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows.     Not to discuss this at length      but my body image was never my strength.     So frankly  I wish that you all would get dressed      I mean  you're not even really naked.     And I'm the one with the problem.     And you tell me  don't worry  so much  you'll be great.     But I'm the one living with me     and I know how I get.     Your advice is gentle but late.     If not just a bit patronizing.     And that sarcastic tone doesn't  help me when I sing.     But we shouldn't talk about  these things right now      really  I'm up on stage  and  you're in the crowd. Hi.     And I'm not making fun of  unnurtured  irrational fear      and if I wasn't ready to face this      I sure as hell wouldn't be here.     But if I belt one note out clearly      you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely.     And maybe next week  I'll set my guitar ringin'     my voice clear as water  and everyone singin'.     But probably I'll just get up and start groovin'      my vocal cords movin'      at speeds slightly faster than sound.   I'd like to reimagine education. The last year has seen the invention of a new four letter word. It starts with an M. MOOC  massive open online courses. Many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world  in the millions  for free. Anybody who has an Internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it. Now  in this discussion today  I'm going to focus on a different aspect of MOOCs. We are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education to really reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom. Now  our classrooms could use change. So  here's a classroom at this little three letter institute in the Northeast of America  MIT. And this was a classroom about    or    years ago  and this is a classroom today. What's changed  The seats are in color. Whoop de do. Education really hasn't changed in the past     years. The last big innovation in education was the printing press and the textbooks. Everything else has changed around us. You know  from healthcare to transportation  everything is different  but education hasn't changed. It's also been a real issue in terms of access. So what you see here is not a rock concert. And the person you see at the end of the stage is not Madonna. This is a classroom at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria. Now  we've all heard of distance education  but the students way in the back      feet away from the instructor  I think they are undergoing long distance education. Now  I really believe that we can transform education  both in quality and scale and access  through technology. For example  at edX  we are trying to transform education through online technologies. Given education has been calcified for     years  we really cannot think about reengineering it  micromanaging it. We really have to completely reimagine it. It's like going from ox carts to the airplane. Even the infrastructure has to change. Everything has to change. We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises  online videos. We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification. We have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards. Everything really has to change. So at edX and a number of other organizations  we are applying these technologies to education through MOOCs to really increase access to education. And you heard of this example  where  when we launched our very first course    and this was an MIT hard circuits and electronics course    about a year and a half ago          students from     countries enrolled in this course. And we had no marketing budget. Now          is a big number. This number is bigger than the total number of alumni of MIT in its     year history.       students passed the course  and this was a hard course.       is also a big number. If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year  I would have to teach for    years before I could teach this many students. Now these large numbers are just one part of the story. So today  I want to discuss a different aspect  the other side of MOOCs  take a different perspective. We are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom  to create a blended model of learning. But before I go into that  let me tell you a story. When my daughter turned     became a teenager  she stopped speaking English  and she began speaking this new language. I call it teen lish. It's a digital language. It's got two sounds  a grunt and a silence.  Honey  come over for dinner.   Hmm.   Did you hear me   Silence.  Laughter   Can you listen to me    quot Hmm. quot  So we had a real issue with communicating  and we were just not communicating  until one day I had this epiphany. I texted her.  Laughter  I got an instant response. I said  no  that must have been by accident. She must have thought  you know  some friend of hers was calling her. So I texted her again. Boom  another response. I said  this is great. And so since then  our life has changed. I text her  she responds. It's just been absolutely great. So our millennial generation is built differently. Now  I'm older  and my youthful looks might belie that  but I'm not in the millennial generation. But our kids are really different. The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology. So why are we fighting it in the classroom  Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it. In fact  I believe    and I have two fat thumbs  I can't text very well    but I'm willing to bet that with evolution  our kids and their grandchildren will develop really  really little  itty bitty thumbs to text much better  that evolution will fix all of that stuff. But what if we embraced technology  embraced the millennial generation's natural predilections  and really think about creating these online technologies  blend them into their lives. So here's what we can do. So rather than driving our kids into a classroom  herding them out there at   o'clock in the morning    I hated going to class at   o'clock in the morning  so why are we forcing our kids to do that  So instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms  in their bedroom  in the dining room  in the bathroom  wherever they're most creative. Then they come into the classroom for some in person interaction. They can have discussions amongst themselves. They can solve problems together. They can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions. In fact  with edX  when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world  this was happening unbeknownst to us. Two high school teachers at the Sant High School in Mongolia had flipped their classroom  and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises  where the learners in the high school     year olds  mind you  would go and do these things in their own homes and they would come into class  and as you see from this image here  they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work. And the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog. We were also doing other pilots. So we did a pilot experimental blended courses  working with San Jose State University in California  again  with the circuits and electronics course. You'll hear that a lot. That course has become sort of like our petri dish of learning. So there  the students would  again  the instructors flipped the classroom  blended online and in person  and the results were staggering. Now don't take these results to the bank just yet. Just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more  but the early results are incredible. So traditionally  semester upon semester  for the past several years  this course  again  a hard course  had a failure rate of about    to    percent every semester. With this blended class late last year  the failure rate fell to nine percent. So the results can be extremely  extremely good. Now before we go too far into this  I'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas. What are some key ideas that makes all of this work  One idea is active learning. The idea here is  rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures  we replace this with what we call lessons. Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises. So a student might watch a five   seven minute video and follow that with an interactive exercise. Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education. You teach by asking questions. And this is a form of learning called active learning  and really promoted by a very early paper  in       by Craik and Lockhart  where they said and discovered that learning and retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing. Students learn much better when they are interacting with the material. The second idea is self pacing. Now  when I went to a lecture hall  and if you were like me  by the fifth minute I would lose the professor. I wasn't all that smart  and I would be scrambling  taking notes  and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour. Instead  wouldn't it be nice with online technologies  we offer videos and interactive engagements to students  They can hit the pause button. They can rewind the professor. Heck  they can even mute the professor. So this form of self pacing can be very helpful to learning. The third idea that we have is instant feedback. With instant feedback  the computer grades exercises. I mean  how else do you teach         students  Your computer is grading all the exercises. And we've all submitted homeworks  and your grades come back two weeks later  you've forgotten all about it. I don't think I've still received some of my homeworks from my undergraduate days. Some are never graded. So with instant feedback  students can try to apply answers. If they get it wrong  they can get instant feedback. They can try it again and try it again  and this really becomes much more engaging. They get the instant feedback  and this little green check mark that you see here is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX. Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark. In fact  one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year  he then went on to take a software course from Berkeley at the end of the year  and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark   quot Oh god  have I missed you. quot  When's the last time you've seen students posting comments like this about homework  My colleague Ed Bertschinger  who heads up the physics department at MIT  has this to say about instant feedback  He indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes. The next big idea is gamification. You know  all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on. You know  they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it. So we applied these gamification techniques to learning  and we can build these online laboratories. How do you teach creativity  How do you teach design  We can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs. So as this little video shows here  you can engage students much like they design with Legos. So here  the learners are building a circuit with Lego like ease. And this can also be graded by the computer. Fifth is peer learning. So here  we use discussion forums and discussions and Facebook like interaction not as a distraction  but to really help students learn. Let me tell you a story. When we did our circuits course for the         students  I didn't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course. I told my TAs  okay        we're going to be up monitoring the forum  answering questions. They had answered questions for     students. How do you do that for          So one night I'm sitting up there  at   a.m. at night  and I think there's this question from a student from Pakistan  and he asked a question  and I said  okay  let me go and type up an answer  I don't type all that fast  and I begin typing up the answer  and before I can finish  another student from Egypt popped in with an answer  not quite right  so I'm fixing the answer  and before I can finish  a student from the U.S. had popped in with a different answer. And then I sat back  fascinated. Boom  boom  boom  boom  the students were discussing and interacting with each other  and by   a.m. that night  I'm totally fascinated  having this epiphany  and by   a.m. in the morning  they had discovered the right answer. And all I had to do was go and bless it   Good answer.  So this is absolutely amazing  where students are learning from each other  and they're telling us that they are learning by teaching. Now this is all not just in the future. This is happening today. So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and  high schools around the world  from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California    all over the world. And these kinds of technologies really help  the blended model can really help revolutionize education. It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs  the business aspect. We can also license these MOOC courses to other universities  and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs  where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next generation textbook. They can use as much or as little as they like  and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal. Finally  I would like to have you dream with me for a little bit. I would like us to really reimagine education. We will have to move from lecture halls to e spaces. We have to move from books to tablets like the Aakash in India or the Raspberry Pi     dollars. The Aakash is    dollars. We have to move from bricks and mortar school buildings to digital dormitories. But I think at the end of the day  I think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities. Otherwise  how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and  you know  you didn't even have a rewind button  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  In       I became the attorney general of the state of New Jersey. Before that  I'd been a criminal prosecutor  first in the Manhattan district attorney's office  and then at the United States Department of Justice. But when I became the attorney general  two things happened that changed  the way I see criminal justice. The first is that I asked what I thought were really basic questions. I wanted to understand who we were arresting  who we were charging  and who we were putting in our nation's jails and prisons. I also wanted to understand if we were making decisions in a way that made us safer. And I couldn't get this information out. It turned out that most big criminal justice agencies like my own didn't track the things that matter. So after about a month of being incredibly frustrated  I walked down into a conference room that was filled with detectives and stacks and stacks of case files  and the detectives were sitting there with yellow legal pads taking notes. They were trying to get the information I was looking for by going through case by case for the past five years. And as you can imagine  when we finally got the results  they weren't good. It turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in Trenton. The second thing that happened is that I spent the day in the Camden  New Jersey police department. Now  at that time  Camden  New Jersey  was the most dangerous city in America. I ran the Camden Police Department because of that. I spent the day in the police department  and I was taken into a room with senior police officials  all of whom were working hard and trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden. And what I saw in that room  as we talked about how to reduce crime  were a series of officers with a lot of little yellow sticky notes. And they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board. And one of them said    We had a robbery two weeks ago. We have no suspects.  And another said   We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week. We have no suspects.  We weren't using data driven policing. We were essentially trying to fight crime with yellow Post it notes. Now  both of these things made me realize fundamentally that we were failing. We didn't even know who was in our criminal justice system  we didn't have any data about the things that mattered  and we didn't share data or use analytics or tools to help us make better decisions and to reduce crime. And for the first time  I started to think about how we made decisions. When I was an assistant D.A.  and when I was a federal prosecutor  I looked at the cases in front of me  and I generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience. When I became attorney general  I could look at the system as a whole  and what surprised me is that I found that that was exactly how we were doing it across the entire system    in police departments  in prosecutors's offices  in courts and in jails. And what I learned very quickly is that we weren't doing a good job. So I wanted to do things differently. I wanted to introduce data and analytics and rigorous statistical analysis into our work. In short  I wanted to moneyball criminal justice. Now  moneyball  as many of you know  is what the Oakland A's did  where they used smart data and statistics to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games  and they went from a system that  was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience  the scouts' instincts and experience  to pick players  from one to use smart data and rigorous statistical analysis to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games. It worked for the Oakland A's  and it worked in the state of New Jersey. We took Camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in America. We reduced murders there by    percent  which actually means    lives were saved. And we reduced all crime in the city by    percent. We also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions. So we went from doing low level drug crimes that were outside our building to doing cases of statewide importance  on things like reducing violence with the most violent offenders  prosecuting street gangs  gun and drug trafficking  and political corruption. And all of this matters greatly  because public safety to me is the most important function of government. If we're not safe  we can't be educated  we can't be healthy  we can't do any of the other things we want to do in our lives. And we live in a country today where we face serious criminal justice problems. We have    million arrests every single year. The vast majority of those arrests are for low level crimes  like misdemeanors     to    percent. Less than five percent of all arrests are for violent crime. Yet we spend    billion  that's b for billion  dollars a year on state and local corrections costs. Right now  today  we have  .  million people in our jails and prisons. And we face unbelievable public safety challenges because we have a situation in which two thirds of the people in our jails are there waiting for trial. They haven't yet been convicted of a crime. They're just waiting for their day in court. And    percent of people come back. Our recidivism rate is amongst  the highest in the world. Almost seven in    people who are released from prison will be rearrested in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration. So when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation  I came back to looking at a lot of these questions  and I came back to thinking about how we had used data and analytics to transform the way we did criminal justice in New Jersey. And when I look at the criminal justice system in the United States today  I feel the exact same way that I did about the state of New Jersey when I started there  which is that we absolutely have to do better  and I know that we can do better. So I decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision in public safety  and that decision is the determination of whether  when someone has been arrested  whether they pose a risk to public safety and should be detained  or whether they don't pose a risk to public safety and should be released. Everything that happens in criminal cases comes out of this one decision. It impacts everything. It impacts sentencing. It impacts whether someone gets drug treatment. It impacts crime and violence. And when I talk to judges around the United States  which I do all the time now  they all say the same thing  which is that we put dangerous people in jail  and we let non dangerous  nonviolent people out. They mean it and they believe it. But when you start to look at the data  which  by the way  the judges don't have  when we start to look at the data  what we find time and time again  is that this isn't the case. We find low risk offenders  which makes up    percent of our entire criminal justice population  we find that they're in jail. Take Leslie Chew  who was a Texas man who stole four blankets on a cold winter night. He was arrested  and he was kept in jail on       dollars bail  an amount that he could not afford to pay. And he stayed in jail for eight months until his case came up for trial  at a cost to taxpayers of more than       dollars. And at the other end of the spectrum  we're doing an equally terrible job. The people who we find are the highest risk offenders  the people who we think have the highest likelihood of committing a new crime if they're released  we see nationally that    percent of those people are being released. The reason for this is the way we make decisions. Judges have the best intentions when they make these decisions about risk  but they're making them subjectively. They're like the baseball scouts    years ago who were using their instinct and their experience to try to decide what risk someone poses. They're being subjective  and we know what happens with subjective decision making  which is that we are often wrong. What we need in this space are strong data and analytics. What I decided to look for was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool  something that would let judges actually understand with a scientific and objective way what the risk was that was posed by someone in front of them. I looked all over the country  and I found that between five and    percent of all U.S. jurisdictions actually use any type of risk assessment tool  and when I looked at these tools  I quickly realized why. They were unbelievably expensive to administer  they were time consuming  they were limited to the local jurisdiction in which they'd been created. So basically  they couldn't be scaled or transferred to other places. So I went out and built a phenomenal team of data scientists and researchers and statisticians to build a universal risk assessment tool  so that every single judge in the United States of America can have an objective  scientific measure of risk. In the tool that we've built  what we did was we collected  .  million cases from all around the United States  from cities  from counties  from every single state in the country  the federal districts. And with those  .  million cases  which is the largest data set on pretrial in the United States today  we were able to basically find that there were     plus risk factors that we could look at to try to figure out what mattered most. And we found that there were nine specific things that mattered all across the country and that were the most highly predictive of risk. And so we built a universal risk assessment tool. And it looks like this. As you'll see  we put some information in  but most of it is incredibly simple  it's easy to use  it focuses on things like the defendant's prior convictions  whether they've been sentenced to incarceration  whether they've engaged in violence before  whether they've even failed to come back to court. And with this tool  we can predict three things. First  whether or not someone will commit a new crime if they're released. Second  for the first time  and I think this is incredibly important  we can predict whether someone will commit an act of violence if they're released. And that's the single most important thing that judges say when you talk to them. And third  we can predict whether someone will come back to court. And every single judge in the United States of America can use it  because it's been created on a universal data set. What judges see if they run the risk assessment tool is this    it's a dashboard. At the top  you see the New Criminal Activity Score  six of course being the highest  and then in the middle you see   Elevated risk of violence.  What that says is that this person is someone who has an elevated risk of violence that the judge should look twice at. And then  towards the bottom  you see the Failure to Appear Score  which again is the likelihood that someone will come back to court. Now I want to say something really important. It's not that I think we should be eliminating the judge's instinct and experience from this process. I don't. I actually believe the problem that we see and the reason that we have these incredible system errors  where we're incarcerating low level  nonviolent people and we're releasing high risk  dangerous people  is that we don't have an objective measure of risk. But what I believe should happen is that we should take that data driven risk assessment and combine that with the judge's instinct and experience to lead us to better decision making. The tool went statewide in Kentucky on July    and we're about to go up in a number of other U.S. jurisdictions. Our goal  quite simply  is that every single judge in the United States will use a data driven risk tool within the next five years. We're now working on risk tools for prosecutors and for police officers as well  to try to take a system that runs today in America the same way it did    years ago  based on instinct and experience  and make it into one that runs on data and analytics. Now  the great news about all this  and we have a ton of work left to do  and we have a lot of culture to change  but the great news about all of it is that we know it works. It's why Google is Google  and it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball to win games. The great news for us as well is that it's the way that we can transform the American criminal justice system. It's how we can make our streets safer  we can reduce our prison costs  and we can make our system much fairer and more just. Some people call it data science. I call it moneyballing criminal justice. Thank you. I'm McKenna Pope. I'm    years old  and when I was     I convinced one of the largest toy companies  toymakers  in the world  Hasbro  to change the way that they marketed one of their most best selling products. So allow me to tell you about it. So I have a brother  Gavin. When this whole shebang happened  he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these  needless to say  uneatable concoctions  or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef than an Easy Bake Oven. Right  I mean  we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly. But then he started to realize something. In the commercials  and on the  boxes for the Easy Bake Ovens  Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials  and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple  very gender specific colors to females  right  So it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook  boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef  because that was something that girls did. Girls cooked  boys didn't  or so was the message that Hasbro was sending. And this got me thinking  God  I wish there was a way that I could change this  that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it. And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks  through Facebook  through Twitter  through YouTube  through Reddit  through Tumblr  through whatever you can think of. And so I created a petition along with the YouTube video that I added to the petition basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it  in featuring boys in the commercials  on the boxes  and most of all creating them in less gender specific colors. So this petition started to take off    humongously fast  you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets  and it was amazing. In three weeks  maybe three and a half  I had        signatures on this petition. Thank you. So  needless to say  it was crazy. Eventually  Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy Bake Oven product to me in black  silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like  quot Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. quot  That thing was amazing. What I didn't realize at the time  however  was that I had become an activist  I could change something  that even as a kid  or maybe  even especially as a kid  my voice mattered  and your voice matters too. I want to let you know it's not going to be easy  and it wasn't easy for me  because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online  and sometimes even in real life  were disrespectful to me and my family  and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time  and it really discouraged me. And actually  I have some examples  because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy  So  let's see. From user name Liquidsore      interesting user names we have here   quot Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay. quot  Liquidsore    really  Really  Okay. How about from Whiteboy  AGS   People always need something to  female dog  about.  From Jeffrey Gutierrez   quot OMG  shut up. You just want money and attention. quot  So it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought  people don't care  people think it's a waste of time  and people are going to be disrespectful  to me and my family. It hurt me  and it made me think  what's the point of making change in the future  But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on  say it with me. One  two  three  Haters gonna hate. So let your haters hate  you know what  and make your change  because I know you can. I look out into this crowd  and I see     people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change  and I know that you can  and all of you watching at home can too because you have so much that you  can do and that you believe in  and you can trade it across all these social media  through Facebook  through Twitter  through  YouTube  through Reddit  through Tumblr  through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been  hearing about all day today  you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire. Thank you. Science  science has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the universe  which is at the same time tremendously important and extremely remote  and yet much  much closer  much more directly related to us  there are many things we don't really understand. And one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us  and today I want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity. But first  what do we call complexity  What is complex  Well  complex is not complicated. Something complicated comprises many small parts  all different  and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery. On the opposite  a complex system is made of many  many similar parts  and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior. Complex systems have many interacting parts which behave according to simple  individual rules  and this results in emergent properties. The behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only. As Aristotle wrote  the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. But from Aristotle  let's move onto a more concrete example of complex systems. These are Scottish terriers. In the beginning  the system is disorganized. Then comes a perturbation  milk. Every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens. The pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction. So it's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges. I call this simplifying complexity  and it's what we do at the chair of systems design at ETH Zurich. We collect data on animal populations  analyze complex patterns  try to explain them. It requires physicists who work with biologists  with mathematicians and computer scientists  and it is their interaction that produces cross boundary competence to solve these problems. So again  the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In a way  collaboration is another example of a complex system. And you may be asking yourself which side I'm on  biology or physics  In fact  it's a little different  and to explain  I need to tell you a short story about myself. When I was a child  I loved to build stuff  to create complicated machines. So I set out to study electrical engineering and robotics  and my end of studies project was about building a robot called ER      it looked like this  that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground. It was very  very complicated  but it worked beautifully in our test room  and on demo day  professors had  assembled to grade the project. So we took ER   to the evaluation room. It turned out  the light in that room was slightly different. The robot's vision system got confused. At the first bend in the line  it left its course  and crashed into a wall. We had spent weeks building it  and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room. That's when I realized that the more complicated you make a machine  the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected. And I decided that  in fact  I didn't really want to create complicated stuff. I wanted to understand complexity  the complexity of the world around us and especially in the animal kingdom. Which brings us to bats. Bechstein's bats are a common species of European bats. They are very social animals. Mostly they roost  or sleep  together. And they live in maternity colonies  which means that every spring  the females meet after the winter hibernation  and they stay together for about six months to rear their young  and they all carry a very small chip  which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes  we know where she is  and more importantly  we know with whom she is. So I study roosting associations in bats  and this is what it looks like. During the day  the bats roost in a number of sub groups in different boxes. It could be that on one day  the colony is split between two boxes  but on another day  it could be together in a single box  or split between three or more boxes  and that all seems rather erratic  really. It's called fission fusion dynamics  the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups. So what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony. Okay  So that's what this picture looks like. In this network  all the circles are nodes  individual bats  and the lines between them are social bonds  associations between individuals. It turns out this is a very interesting picture. This bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission fusion dynamics. We call them cryptic social units. Even more interesting  in fact  Every year  around October  the colony splits up  and all bats hibernate separately  but year after year  when the bats come together again in the spring  the communities stay the same. So these bats remember their friends for a really long time. With a brain the size of a peanut  they maintain individualized  long term social bonds  We didn't know that was possible. We knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that  but compared to bats  they have huge brains. So how could it be that the bats maintain this complex  stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities  And this is where complexity brings an answer. To understand this system  we built a computer model of roosting  based on simple  individual rules  and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony. It's a mathematical model  but it's not complicated. What the model told us is that  in a nutshell  each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends  and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them. Simple  individual rules. This is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats. But it gets better. Between      and       the colony lost more than two thirds of its members  probably due to the very cold winter. The next spring  it didn't form two communities like every year  which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small. Instead  it formed a single  cohesive social unit  which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years. What we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this. All they do is follow simple association rules  and from this simplicity emerges social complexity which allows the colony to be resilient against dramatic changes in the population structure. And I find this incredible. Now I want to tell you another story  but for this we have to travel from Europe to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa. This is where meerkats live. I'm sure you know meerkats. They're fascinating creatures. They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy. There is one dominant pair  and many subordinates  some acting as sentinels  some acting as babysitters  some teaching pups  and so on. What we do is put very small GPS collars on these animals to study how they move together  and what this has to do with their social structure. And there's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats. In the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road. On this road there are cars  so it's dangerous. But the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to another. So we asked  how exactly do they do this  We found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road  but when it comes to crossing it  crossing the road  she gives way to the subordinates  a manner of saying   Go ahead  tell me if it's safe.  What I didn't know  in fact  was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it. So I built a model  a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road. It's a simplistic model. Moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment. They simply move together. When these particles get to the road  they sense some kind of obstacle  and they bounce against it. The only difference between the dominant female  here in red  and the other individuals  is that for her  the height of the obstacle  which is in fact the risk perceived from the road  is just slightly higher  and this tiny difference in the individual's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe  that the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first. George Box  who was an English statistician  once wrote   All models are false  but some models are useful.  And in fact  this model is obviously false  because in reality  meerkats are anything but random particles. But it's also useful  because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group. So again  that's simplifying complexity. I would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species. When the dominant female gives way to a subordinate  it's not out of courtesy. In fact  the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group. If she dies on the road  the whole group is at risk. So this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response. These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old  and they're adapting it to a modern risk  in this case a road built by humans. They adapt very simple rules  and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat. In the end  it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash  or it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road  or it may be another species. My message here    and it's not a complicated one  but a simple one of wonder and hope    my message here is that animals show extraordinary social complexity  and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment. In three words  in the animal kingdom  simplicity leads to complexity which leads to resilience. Thank you. Dania Gerhardt  Thank you very much  Nicolas  for this great start. Little bit nervous  Nicolas Perony  I'm okay  thanks. DG  Okay  great. I'm sure a  lot of people in the audience somehow tried to make associations between the animals you were talking about    the bats  meerkats    and humans. You brought some examples  The females are the social ones  the females are the dominant ones  I'm not sure who thinks how. But is it okay to do these associations  Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard that can be valid across all species  NP  Well  I would say there are also counter examples to these stereotypes. For examples  in sea horses or in koalas  in fact  it is the males who take care of the young always. And the lesson is that it's often difficult  and sometimes even a bit dangerous  to draw parallels between humans and animals. So that's it. DG  Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.

Maya Penn  I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon  and I've been making animated flip books since I was three years old. At that age  I also learned about what an animator was. There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don't know about. When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV  I immediately said   That's what I want to be.  I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud  but that was a greatly defining moment in my life. Animation and art has always been my first love. It was my love for technology that sparked the idea for  Malicious Dishes.  There was a virus on my computer  and I was trying to get rid of it  and all of a sudden  I just thought  what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer  Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things  And thus   Malicious Dishes  was born. At four years old  my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again. That started my love for technology. I built my first website myself in HTML  and I'm learning JavaScript and Python. I'm also working on an animated series called  The Pollinators.  It's about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they're so important. If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators  then all creatures  including ourselves  that depend on these plants  would starve. So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team. Pollinator  Deforestsaurus  I should have known  I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators  Thank you.  Applause  All of my animations start with ideas  but what are ideas  Ideas can spark a movement. Ideas are opportunities and innovation. Ideas truly are what make the world go round. If it wasn't for ideas  we wouldn't be where we are now with technology  medicine  art  culture  and how we even live our lives. At eight years old  I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya's Ideas  and my nonprofit  Maya's Ideas for the Planet. And I make eco friendly clothing and accessories. I'm    now  and although I started my business in       my artistic journey started way before then. I was greatly influenced by art  and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did  even my business. I would find different fabrics around the house  and say   quot This could be a scarf or a hat  quot  and I had all these ideas for designs. I noticed when I wore my creations  people would stop me and say   Wow  that's really cute. Where can I get one   And I thought  I can start my own business. Now I didn't have any business plans at only eight years old. I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back. My mom taught me how to sew  and on my back porch  I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon  and I would write down the names and the price of each item. I started making more items like hats  scarves and bags. Soon  my items began selling all over the world  and I had customers in Denmark  Italy  Australia  Canada and more. Now  I had a lot to learn about my business  like branding and marketing  staying engaged with my customers  and seeing what sold the most and the least. Soon  my business really started to take off. Then one day  Forbes magazine  contacted me when I was    years old. They wanted to feature me and my company in their article. Now a lot of people ask me  why is your business eco friendly  I've had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little. My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment. I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet  so I started doing my own research  and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed  there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment. For example  the grinding of materials  or the dumping of dried powder materials. These actions can pollute the air  making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it. So when I started my business  I knew two things  All of my items had to be eco friendly  and    to    percent of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations. I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business  but also a sustainable future. I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow. We live in a big  diverse and beautiful world  and that makes me even more passionate to save it. But it's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world. It takes to get it through your hearts  because when you get it through your heart  that is when movements are sparked. That is when opportunities and innovation are created  and that is why ideas come to life. Thank you  and peace and blessings. Thank you.
