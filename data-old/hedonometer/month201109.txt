Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things. I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self assembling  replicating and repairing themselves. So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing  and then compare that to some natural systems. So in the current state of manufacturing  we have skyscrapers    two and a half years  of assembly time           to a million parts  fairly complex  new  exciting technologies in steel  concrete  glass. We have exciting machines that can take us into space    five years  of assembly time    .  million parts. But on the other side  if you look at the natural systems  we have proteins that have two million types  can fold in        nanoseconds  or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour. So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems  but they're extremely efficient  far more efficient than anything we can build  far more complex than anything we can build. They're far more efficient in terms of energy. They hardly ever make mistakes. And they can repair themselves for longevity. So there's something super interesting about natural systems. And if we can translate that into our built environment  then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things. And I think the key to that is self assembly. So if we want to utilize self assembly in our physical environment  I think there's four key factors. The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build    so our buildings and machines. And we need to decode that into simple sequences    basically the DNA of how our buildings work. Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up  or reconfigure. We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate  allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program. And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want. So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self assembling future. The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot. So these projects are large scale reconfigurable robots      ft.     ft. long proteins. They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices  sensors. You decode what you want to fold up into  into a sequence of angles    so negative      negative                 negative        something like that  so a sequence of angles  or turns  and you send that sequence through the string. Each unit takes its message    so negative        it rotates to that  checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor. So these are the brilliant scientists  engineers  designers that worked on this project. And I think it really brings to light  Is this really scalable  I mean  thousands of dollars  lots of man hours made to make this eight foot robot. Can we really scale this up  Can we really embed robotics into every part  The next one questions that and looks at passive nature  or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability. But it goes a step further  and it tries to have actual computation. It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing  the digital logic gate  directly into your parts. So this is a NAND gate. You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing  and you have two input tetrahedrons. One of them is the input from the user  as you're building your bricks. The other one is from the previous brick that was placed. And then it gives you an output in  D space. So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do. It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do. And now it starts moving in three dimensional space    so up or down. So on the left hand side        input equals   output  which goes down. On the right hand side        input is a   output  which goes up. And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build. So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed. So that means that we can have some form of self replication. In this case I call it self guided replication  because your structure contains the exact blueprints. If you have errors  you can replace a part. All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it. So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one. It's directly embedded  there's no external instructions. So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains  and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self assembly systems. So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system. So basically you have a chain of elements. Each element is completely identical  and they're biased. So each chain  or each element  wants to turn right or left. So as you assemble the chain  you're basically programming it. You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left. So when you shake the chain  it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in    so in this case  a spiral  or in this case  two cubes next to each other. So you can basically program any three dimensional shape    or one dimensional  two dimensional    up into this chain completely passively. So what does this tell us about the future  I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self assembly  replication  repair in our physical structures  our buildings  machines. There's new programmability in these parts. And from that you have new possibilities for computing. We'll have spatial computing. Imagine if our buildings  our bridges  machines  all of our bricks could actually compute. That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power  new design possibilities. So it's exciting potential for this. So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future  if we implement these new technologies for a new self assembling world. Thank you. I want to address the issue of compassion. Compassion has many faces. Some of them are fierce  some of them are wrathful  some of them are tender  some of them are wise. A line that the Dalai Lama once said  he said   Love and compassion are necessities. They are not luxuries. Without them  humanity cannot survive.  And I would suggest  it is not only humanity that won't survive  but it is all species on the planet  as we've heard today. It is the big cats  and it's the plankton. Two weeks ago  I was in Bangalore in India. I was so privileged to be able to teach in a hospice on the outskirts of Bangalore. And early in the morning  I went into the ward. In that hospice  there were    men and women who were actively dying. And I walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly  fragile  obviously in the latter phase of active dying. I looked into her face. I looked into the face of her son sitting next to her  and his face was just riven with grief and confusion. And I remembered a line from the Mahabharata  the great Indian epic   What is the most wondrous thing in the world  Yudhisthira   And Yudhisthira replied   The most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don't realize it can happen to us.  I looked up. Tending those    dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore. I looked into the face of one of these women  and I saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present. I watched her hands as she bathed an old man. My gaze went to another young woman as she wiped the face of another dying person. And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for. Every year or so  I have the privilege of taking clinicians into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever. And on the first day at Simikot in Humla  far west of Nepal  the most impoverished region of Nepal  an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags. And he walked in  and somebody said something to him  we realized he was deaf  and we looked into the rags  and there was this pair of eyes. The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned. Again  the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara. It was the young women  the health aids  who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds. I know those hands and eyes  they touched me as well. They touched me at that time. They have touched me throughout my    years. They touched me when I was four and I lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed. And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me. And that woman did not have sentimental compassion. She had phenomenal strength. And it was really her strength  I believe  that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life. So we can ask  What is compassion comprised of  And there are various facets. And there's referential and non referential compassion. But first  compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering. It is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that I'm not separate from this suffering. But that is not enough  because compassion  which activates the motor cortex  means that we aspire  we actually aspire to transform suffering. And if we're so blessed  we engage in activities that transform suffering. But compassion has another component  and that component is really essential. That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome. Now I worked with dying people for over    years. I had the privilege of working on death row in a maximum security  prison  for six years. And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience  from working with dying people and training caregivers  that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe. And when I worked in the prison system  it was so clear to me  this  that many of us in this room  and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row  the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered. That compassion is actually an inherent human quality. It is there within every human being. But the conditions for compassion to be activated  to be aroused  are particular conditions. I had that condition  to a certain extent  from my own childhood illness. Eve Ensler  whom you'll hear later  has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through. And what is fascinating is that compassion has enemies  and those enemies are things like pity  moral outrage  fear. And you know  we have a society  a world  that is paralyzed by fear. And in that paralysis  of course  our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed. The very word terror is global. The very feeling of terror is global. So our work  in a certain way  is to address this imago  this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe. Now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities. For example  A person who is cultivating compassion  when they are in the presence of suffering  they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do. However  they return to baseline a lot sooner. This is called resilience. Many of us think that compassion drains us  but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us. Another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration. It hooks up all parts of the brain. Another  which has been discovered by various researchers at Emory and at Davis and so on  is that compassion enhances our immune system. Hey  we live in a very noxious world. Most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho social and physical poisons  of the toxins of our world. But compassion  the generation of compassion  actually mobilizes our immunity. You know  if compassion is so good for us  I have a question. Why don't we train our children in compassion  If compassion is so good for us  why don't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they're supposed to do  which is to really transform suffering  And if compassion is so good for us  why don't we vote on compassion  Why don't we vote for people in our government based on compassion  so that we can have a more caring world  In Buddhism  we say   it takes a strong back and a soft front.  It takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions. And that is the mental quality of equanimity. But it also takes a soft front    the capacity to really be open to the world as it is  to have an undefended heart. And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara  Kuan Yin. It's a female archetype  she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. She stands with        arms  and in every hand  there is an instrument of liberation  and in the palm of every hand  there are eyes  and these are the eyes of wisdom. I say that  for thousands of years  women have lived  exemplified  met in intimacy  the archetype of Avalokitesvara  of Kuan Yin  she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered  unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is. They have infused societies with kindness  and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half. And they have actualized compassion through direct action. Jody Williams called it  It's good to meditate. I'm sorry  you've got to do a little bit of that  Jody. Step back  give your mother a break  okay. But the other side of the equation is you've got to come out of your cave. You have to come into the world like Asanga did  who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha after    years sitting in the cave. He said   I'm out of here.  He's going down the path. He sees something in the path. He looks  it's a dog  he drops to his knees. He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg. The wound is just filled with maggots. He puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots  so as not to harm them. And at that moment  the dog transformed into the Buddha of love and kindness. I believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men    with their fathers  with their sons  with their brothers  with the plumbers  the road builders  the caregivers  the doctors  the lawyers  with our president  and with all beings. The women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire. May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere. Thank you. I didn't always love unintended consequences  but I've really learned to appreciate them. I've learned that they're really the essence of what makes for progress  even when they seem to be terrible. And I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do. Let's go to        years before the present  to the time of the cultural explosion  when music  art  technology  so many of the things that we're enjoying today  so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED were born. And the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation  that if our ancestors        years ago had been able to see what they had done  they wouldn't have really understood it. They were responding to immediate concerns. They were making it possible for us to do what they do  and yet  they didn't really understand how they did it. Now let's advance to        years before the present. And this is when it really gets interesting. What about the domestication of grains  What about the origins of agriculture  What would our ancestors        years ago have said if they really had technology assessment  And I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity  at least in the next few hundred years. It was really bad news. First of all  worse nutrition  maybe shorter life spans. It was simply awful for women. The skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning  noon and night. And politically  it was awful. It was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people. If there had been rational technology assessment then  I think they very well might have said   Let's call the whole thing off.  Even now  our choices are having unintended effects. Historically  for example  chopsticks    according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan    resulted in long term changes in the dentition  in the teeth  of the Japanese public. And we are also changing our teeth right now. There is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time. That's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence. But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal  there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have. So these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand. In the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences  and there was a very healthy sense of caution  reflected in the Tree of Knowledge  in Pandora's Box  and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology. And that's all very true. The physicians of the ancient world    especially the Egyptians  who started medicine as we know it    were very conscious of what they could and couldn't treat. And the translations of the surviving texts say   This I will not treat. This I cannot treat.  They were very conscious. So were the followers of Hippocrates. The Hippocratic manuscripts also    repeatedly  according to recent studies    show how important it is not to do harm. More recently  Harvey Cushing  who really developed neurosurgery as we know it  who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook  he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing. But he did his best  and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine. Now if we look forward a bit to the   th century  we find a new style of technology. What we find is  no longer simple tools  but systems. We find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what's going on. And the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the mid   th century  who were the original hackers. Thomas Edison would have been very  very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today. And these hackers had a word for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems that they called bugs. That was the origin of the word  bug.  This consciousness  though  was a little slow to seep through the general population  even people who were very  very well informed. Samuel Clemens  Mark Twain  was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times    at least until         registered with the U.S. Patent Office. That was the Paige typesetter. The Paige typesetter had        parts. The patent had    pages of text and     figures. It was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type    including returning the type to its place  which was a very difficult thing. And Mark Twain  who knew all about typesetting  really was smitten by this machine. Unfortunately  he was smitten in more ways than one  because it made him bankrupt  and he had to tour the world speaking to recoup his money. And this was an important thing about   th century technology  that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart  even when judged by the most expert people. Now there is something else  though  in the early   th century that made things even more complicated. And that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger. The lesson of the Titanic  for a lot of the contemporaries  was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship. And this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them. However  there was another case  the Eastland  a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in       and it killed     people    that was    more than the passenger toll of the Titanic. The reason for it  in part  was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable. And that again proves that when you're talking about unintended consequences  it's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw. It's really a question of the system  how the ship was loaded  the ballast and many other things. So the   th century  then  saw how much more complex reality was  but it also saw a positive side. It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies. It could benefit from tragedies. And my favorite example of that    which is not really widely known as a technological miracle  but it may be one of the greatest of all times  was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War. Penicillin was discovered in       but even by       no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced. A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it. They were working on it independently  and they weren't getting anywhere. And the Government Research Bureau brought representatives together and told them that this is something that has to be done. And not only did they do it  but within two years  they scaled up penicillin from preparation in one liter flasks to        gallon vats. That was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time. In the Second World War  too  the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain. So there were benefits in calamities    benefits to pure science  as well as to applied science and medicine. Now when we come to the period after the Second World War  unintended consequences get even more interesting. And my favorite example of that occurred beginning in       when it was discovered that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters  but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating  ventilating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of Legionella bacillus. Well  technology to the rescue. So chemists got to work  and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems. But something else happened in the early     s  and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the United States. And IBM  which made them  just didn't know what to do. They commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate  and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts. What happened was the bactericide was formulated with minute traces of tin. And these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads. So they reformulated the bactericide. But what's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering  at least indirectly  from a human disease. So it shows that we're really all in this together. In fact  it also shows something interesting  that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically  unfortunately  our ability to model their long term behavior  which has also been increasing  has been increasing only arithmetically. So one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight. One other very positive consequence of   th century technology  though  was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances. There are two historians of business at the University of Maryland  Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch  who have done some extremely interesting work  much of it still unpublished  on the history of major innovations. They have combined the list of major innovations  and they've discovered that the greatest number  the greatest decade  for fundamental innovations  as reflected in all of the lists that others have made    a number of lists that they have merged    was the Great Depression. And nobody knows just why this was so  but one story can reflect something of it. It was the origin of the Xerox copier  which celebrated its   th anniversary last year. And Chester Carlson  the inventor  was a patent attorney. He really was not intending to work in patent research  but he couldn't really find an alternative technical job. So this was the best job he could get. He was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions  and so he started to develop a system of dry photocopying  which he patented in the late     s    and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in     . So we see that sometimes  as a result of these dislocations  as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference  that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity. What does this mean  It means  I think  that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities. Think of the financial world  for example. The mentor of Warren Buffett  Benjamin Graham  developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in the      crash. And he published that book in the early     s  and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook. So many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters. Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now    bed bugs  killer bees  spam    and it's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question. If we think  for example  of Louis Pasteur  who in the     s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry  and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease. So very often  some kind of disaster    sometimes the consequence  for example  of over cultivation of silk worms  which was a problem in Europe at the time    can be the key to something much bigger. So this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences. We need to take a really positive view. We need to see what they can do for us. We need to learn from those figures that I mentioned. We need to learn  for example  from Dr. Cushing  who killed patients in the course of his early operations. He had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes. And he learned meticulously from his mistakes. And as a result  when we say   This isn't brain surgery   that pays tribute to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered so discouraging in its prospects. And we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge  to share their knowledge  in the face of an emergency  which they hadn't really been for years and years. They might have been able to do it earlier. The message  then  for me  about unintended consequences is chaos happens  let's make better use of it. Thank you very much. I am the daughter of a forger  not just any forger ... When you hear the word  forger   you often understand  mercenary.  You understand  forged currency    forged pictures.  My father is no such man. For    years of his life  he made false papers    never for himself  always for other people  and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed. Let me introduce him. Here is my father at age   . It all began for him during World War II  when at age    he found himself thrust into a forged documents workshop. He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance. And it's not a banal story    after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the '  s. When I was a child I knew nothing about this  of course. This is me in the middle making faces. I grew up in the Paris suburbs and I was the youngest of three children. I had a  normal  dad like everybody else  apart from the fact that he was    years older than ... well  he was basically old enough to be my grandfather. Anyway  he was a photographer and a street educator  and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly. And  of course  he never talked about his past life when he was a forger. There was  however  an incident I'm going to tell you about  that perhaps could have led me suspect something. I was in high school and got a bad grade  a rare event for me  so I decided to hide it from my parents. In order to do that  I set out to forge their signature. I started working on my mother's signature  because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge. So  I got working. I took some sheets of paper and started practicing  practicing  practicing  until I reached what I thought was a steady hand  and went into action. Later  while checking my school bag  my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged. She yelled at me like she never had before. I went to hide in my bedroom  under the blankets  and then I waited for my father to come back from work with  one could say  much apprehension. I heard him come in. I remained under the blankets. He entered my room  sat on the corner of the bed  and he was silent  so I pulled the blanket from my head  and when he saw me he started laughing. He was laughing so hard  he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand. Then he said   But really  Sarah  you could have worked harder  Can't you see it's really too small   Indeed  it's rather small. I was born in Algeria. There I would hear people say my father was a  moudjahid  and that means  fighter.  Later on  in France  I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations  and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life  especially that he had  done  World War II  that he had  done  the Algerian war. And in my head I would be thinking that  doing  a war meant being a soldier. But knowing my father  and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non violent  I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun. And indeed  I was very far from the mark. One day  while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality  I happened to see some documents that caught my attention. These are real  These are mine  I was born an Argentinean. But the document I happened to see that would help us build a case for the authorities was a document from the army that thanked my father for his work on behalf of the secret services. And then  suddenly  I went  wow   My father  a secret agent  It was very James Bond. I wanted to ask him questions  which he didn't answer. And later  I told myself that one day I would have to question him. And then I became a mother and had a son  and finally decided it was time    that he absolutely had to talk to us. I had become a mother and he was celebrating his   th birthday  and suddenly I was very  very afraid. I feared he'd go and take his silences with him  and take his secrets with him. I managed to convince him that it was important for us  but possibly also for other people that he shared his story. He decided to tell it to me and I made a book  from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later. So  his story. My father was born in Argentina. His parents were of Russian descent. The whole family came to settle in France in the '  s. His parents were Jewish  Russian and above all  very poor. So at the age of    my father had to work. And with his only diploma  his primary education certificate  he found himself working at a dyer   dry cleaner. That's where he discovered something totally magical  and when he talks about it  it's fascinating    it's the magic of dyeing chemistry. During that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was   . This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness. All day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn  to accumulate more and more knowledge  and at night  when no one was looking  he'd put his experience to practice. He was mostly interested in ink bleaching. All this to tell you that if my father became a forger  actually  it was almost by accident. His family was Jewish  so they were hounded. Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers. Well  they were out  but they were always in danger. The big  Jew  stamp was still on their papers. It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents. My father had been instilled with such respect for the law that although he was being persecuted  he'd never thought of false papers. But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance. In those times documents had hard covers  they were filled in by hand  and they stated your job. In order to survive  he needed to be working. He asked the man to write  dyer.  Suddenly the man looked very  very interested. As a  dyer   do you know how to bleach ink marks  Of course he knew. And suddenly the man started explaining that actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem  even the top experts could not manage to bleach an ink  called  indelible   the  Waterman  blue ink. And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly how to bleach it. Now  of course  the man was very impressed with this young man of    who could immediately give him the formula  so he recruited him. And actually  without knowing it  my father had invented something we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case  the so called  correction pen.  But it was only the beginning. That's my father. As soon as he got to the lab  even though he was the youngest  he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents. All the movements stopped at falsifying. But demand was ever growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents. He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch. He started a press. He started photoengraving. He started making rubber stamps. He started inventing all kind of things    with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel. Anyway  he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output. He had made a simple calculation  In one hour he could make    forged documents. If he slept one hour     people would die. This sense of responsibility for other people's lives when he was just       and also his guilt for being a survivor  since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not    stayed with him all his life. And this is maybe what explains why  for    years  he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices. I'd like to talk about those sacrifices  because there were many. There were obviously financial sacrifices because he always refused to be paid. To him  being paid would have meant being a mercenary. If he had accepted payment  he wouldn't be able to say  yes  or  no  depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause. So he was a photographer by day  and a forger by night for    years. He was broke all of the time. Then there were the emotional sacrifices  How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets  How can one explain what one does at night in the lab  every single night  Of course  there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that I understood much later. One day my father introduced me to my sister. He also explained to me that I had a brother  too  and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four  and they were    years older than me. They are both in their sixties now. In order to write the book  I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was  who was the father she had known. She explained that the father that she'd had would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk. They would get all dressed up and wait for him  but he would almost never come. He'd say   I'll call.  He wouldn't call. And then he would not come. Then one day he totally disappeared. Time passed  and they thought he had surely forgotten them  at first. Then as time passed  at the end of almost two years  they thought   Well  perhaps our father has died.  And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful. And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned  orphaned  my father was making false papers. And if he did not tell them  it was of course to protect them. After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel. And then  as he was a staunch anti colonialist  he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war. After the Algerian war  at the heart of the international resistance movements  his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door. In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence  Guinea  Guinea Bissau  Angola. And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti apartheid party. He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans. There was also Latin America. My father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the Dominican Republic  Haiti  and then it was the turn of Brazil  Argentina  Venezuela  El Salvador  Nicaragua  Colombia  Peru  Uruguay  Chile and Mexico. Then there was the Vietnam War. My father made false papers for the American deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese. Europe was not spared either. My father made false papers for the dissidents against Franco in Spain  Salazar in Portugal  against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece  and even in France. There  just once  it happened in May of     . My father watched  benevolently  of course  the demonstrations of the month of May  but his heart was elsewhere  and so was his time because he had over    countries to serve. Once  though  he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize. He was much younger in those days  and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting. He told me that those false papers were the most media relevant and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life. But  he agreed to do it  even though Daniel Cohn Bendit's life was not in danger  just because it was a good opportunity to mock the authorities  and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders    and that ideas have no borders. All my childhood  while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales  my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles. And those heroes did not need an army behind them. Anyhow  nobody would have followed them  except for a handful  of  men and women of conviction and courage. I understood much later that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep. I asked him whether  considering the sacrifices he had to make  he ever had any regrets. He said no. He told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything. He was persuaded  and he's still convinced that another world is possible    a world where no one would ever need a forger. He's still dreaming about it. My father is here in the room today. His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up. Thank you. What I'm going to try and do in the next    minutes or so is tell you about an idea of how we're going to make matter come alive. Now this may seem a bit ambitious  but when you look at yourself  you look at your hands  you realize that you're alive. So this is a start. Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth. There's been four billion years of organic  biological life. And as an inorganic chemist  my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic  living world and the inorganic  dead world. And what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic  dead matter into living matter  into inorganic biology. Before we do that  I want to kind of put biology in its place. And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology. I love to do synthetic biology. I love things that are alive. I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology. But within that infrastructure  we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution. And evolution  although it was established well over     years ago by Charles Darwin and a vast number of other people  evolution still is a little bit intangible. And when I talk about Darwinian evolution  I mean one thing and one thing only  and that is survival of the fittest. And so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way. Think about evolution in terms of offspring competing  and some winning. So bearing that in mind  as a chemist  I wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology  What is the minimal unit of matter that can undergo Darwinian evolution  And this seems quite a profound question. And as a chemist  we're not used to profound questions every day. So when I thought about it  then suddenly I realized that biology gave us the answer. And in fact  the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is  in fact  a single cell    a bacteria. So this raises three really important questions  What is life  Is biology special  Biologists seem to think so. Is matter evolvable  Now if we answer those questions in reverse order  the third question    is matter evolvable     if we can answer that  then we're going to know how special biology is  and maybe  just maybe  we'll have some idea of what life really is. So here's some inorganic life. This is a dead crystal  and I'm going to do something to it  and it's going to become alive. And you can see  it's kind of pollinating  germinating  growing. This is an inorganic tube. And all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago  and they look alive. Of course  they're not alive. It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden. But when I saw this  I was really fascinated  because it seemed lifelike. And as I pause for a few seconds  have a look at the screen. You can see there's architecture growing  filling the void. And this is dead. So I was positive that  if somehow we can make things mimic life  let's go one step further. Let's see if we can actually make life. But there's a problem  because up until maybe a decade ago  we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe. In fact  we were the only people in the universe. Now  that's a bit boring. So as a chemist  I wanted to say   Hang on. What is going on here  Is life that improbable   And this is really the question. I think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars. And in fact  let's take that one step further. Let's say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe  maybe the physics of life is as well. And so the problem with chemists    and this is a massive advantage as well    is we like to focus on our elements. In biology  carbon takes center stage. And in a universe where carbon exists and organic biology  then we have all this wonderful diversity of life. In fact  we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate. We're awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards. Well what about matter  If we can make matter alive  would we have a matterhazard  So think  this is a serious question. If your pen could replicate  that would be a bit of a problem. So we have to think differently if we're going to make stuff come alive. And we also have to be aware of the issues. But before we can make life  let's think for a second what life really is characterized by. And forgive the complicated diagram. This is just a collection of pathways in the cell. And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing. Synthetic biologists are manipulating it. Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease. And you have all these pathways going on at the same time. You have regulation  information is transcribed  catalysts are made  stuff is happening. But what does a cell do  Well it divides  it competes  it survives. And I think that is where we have to start in terms of thinking about building from our ideas in life. But what else is life characterized by  Well  I like think of it as a flame in a bottle. And so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating  metabolizing  burning through chemistries. And so we have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life  we need to power it somehow. So before we can really start to make life  we have to really think about where it came from. And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere    maybe not in Scotland  maybe in Africa  maybe somewhere else. But the real honest answer is  we just don't know  because there is a problem with the origin. Imagine way back  four and a half billion years ago  there is a vast chemical soup of stuff. And from this stuff we came. So when you think about the improbable nature of what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes  just remember  we came from stuff on planet Earth. And we went through a variety of worlds. The RNA people would talk about the RNA world. We somehow got to proteins and DNA. We then got to the last ancestor. Evolution kicked in    and that's the cool bit. And here we are. But there's a roadblock that you can't get past. You can decode the genome  you can look back  you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA  but we can't get further than the last ancestor  the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history. So we don't know how we got here. So there are two options  intelligent design  direct and indirect    so God  or my friend. Now talking about E.T. putting us there  or some other life  just pushes the problem further on. I'm not a politician  I'm a scientist. The other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity. This seems most likely. So we have some kind of primordial soup. And this one happens to be a good source of all    amino acids. And somehow these amino acids are combined  and life begins. But life begins  what does that mean  What is life  What is this stuff of life  So in the     s  Miller Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment  where they did the equivalent in the chemical world. They took the basic ingredients  put them in a single jar and ignited them and put a lot of voltage through. And they had a look at what was in the soup  and they found amino acids  but nothing came out  there was no cell. So the whole area's been stuck for a while  and it got reignited in the '  s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on. In my own laboratory  the way we're trying to create inorganic life is by using many different reaction formats. So what we're trying to do is do reactions    not in one flask  but in tens of flasks  and connect them together  as you can see with this flow system  all these pipes. We can do it microfluidically  we can do it lithographically  we can do it in a  D printer  we can do it in droplets for colleagues. And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away. But that's probably going to end in failure  so we need to be a bit more focused. And the answer  of course  lies with mice. This is how I remember what I need as a chemist. I say   Well I want molecules.  But I need a metabolism  I need some energy. I need some information  and I need a container. Because if I want evolution  I need containers to compete. So if you have a container  it's like getting in your car.  This is my car  and I'm going to drive around and show off my car.  And I imagine you have a similar thing in cellular biology with the emergence of life. So these things together give us evolution  perhaps. And the way to test it in the laboratory is to make it minimal. So what we're going to try and do is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules. And so forgive the molecules on the screen  but these are a very simple kit. There's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present. And we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nano molecular molecules the same size of DNA and proteins  but there's no carbon in sight. Carbon is banned. And so with this Lego kit  we have the diversity required for complex information storage without DNA. But we need to make some containers. And just a few months ago in my lab  we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them. And you can see on the screen a cell being made. And we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell. And all I wanted to show you is we can set up molecules in membranes  in real cells  and then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism  a molecular survival of the fittest. And this movie here shows this competition between molecules. Molecules are competing for stuff. They're all made of the same stuff  but they want their shape to win. They want their shape to persist. And that is the key. If we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete  they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete. If we manage to do that  forget the molecular detail. Let's zoom out to what that could mean. So we have this special theory of evolution that applies only to organic biology  to us. If we could get evolution into the material world  then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution. And that's really worth thinking about. Does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe  Is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete  So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution. So you imagine  if we're able to create a self sustaining artificial life form  not only will this tell us about the origin of life    that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive  it can use anything    we can then take  it  one step further and develop new technologies  because we can then use software control for evolution to code in. So imagine we make a little cell. We want to put it out in the environment  and we want it to be powered by the Sun. What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on. And we don't use design anymore. We find what works. We should take our inspiration from biology. Biology doesn't care about the design unless it works. So this will reorganize the way we design things. But not only just that  we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology. Wouldn't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with  The real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything  because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution. Evolution cannot be cut apart. You need to somehow find the fitness function. And the profound realization for me is that  if this works  the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level  and we really start talking about selfish matter. And what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff  You're sitting on chairs. They're inanimate  they're not alive. But you are made of stuff  and you are using stuff  and you enslave stuff. So using evolution in biology  and in inorganic biology  for me is quite appealing  quite exciting. And we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive. And again  when you're thinking about how improbable this is  remember  five billion years ago  we were not here  and there was no life. So what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life  But perhaps  for me as a chemist  I want to keep away from general terms  I want to think about specifics. So what does it mean about defining life  We really struggle to do this. And I think  if we can make inorganic biology  and we can make matter become evolvable  that will in fact define life. I propose to you that matter that can evolve is alive  and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Just a quick question on timeline. You believe you're going to be successful in this project  When  Lee Cronin  So many people think that life took millions of years to kick in. We're proposing to do it in just a few hours  once we've set up the right chemistry. CA  And when do you think that will happen  LC  Hopefully within the next two years. CA  That would be a big story. In your own mind  what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is non carbon based life  walking or oozing or something  LC  I think it's     percent. Because the thing is  we are so chauvinistic to biology  if you take away carbon  there's other things that can happen. So the other thing that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon  maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for. Don't go and look for carbon  go and look for evolvable stuff. CA  Lee Cronin  good luck.  LC  Thank you very much.  Hi everyone. I'm an artist and a dad    second time around. Thank you. And I want to share with you my latest art project. It's a children's book for the iPad. It's a little quirky and silly. It's called  Pop It   And it's about the things little kids do with their parents. So this is about potty training    as most of you  I hope  know. You can tickle the rug. You can make the baby poop. You can do all those fun things. You can burst bubbles. You can draw  as everyone should. But you know  I have a problem with children's books  I think they're full of propaganda. At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope  forget it. It's not the way I was brought up. So I said   I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda.  If you notice carefully  it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child. You don't like it  Shake it  and you have a lesbian couple. Shake it  and you have a heterosexual couple. You know  I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family. I have to tell you about my childhood. I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns  fathers  brothers  sisters. Basically  I was brought up to be a good Samaritan  and I am. And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house  which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood. Basically  I celebrated every religious function. In fact  when there was a wedding in our neighborhood  all of us would paint our houses for the wedding. I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani. We all had to fast during Ramadan. It was a very beautiful time. But I must say  I'll never forget  when I was    years old  this happened. Babri Masjid    one of the most beautiful mosques in India  built by King Babur  I think  in the   th century    was demolished by Hindu activists. This caused major riots in my city. And for the first time  I was affected by this communal unrest. My little five year old kid neighbor comes running in  and he says   Rags  Rags. You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful.  I'm like   Dude  I'm Hindu.  He's like   Huh   You know  my work is inspired by events such as this. Even in my gallery shows  I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid  distill only its emotional residue and image my own life. Imagine history being taught differently. Remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change  I have another idea. It's a children's book about Indian independence    very patriotic. But when you shake it  you get Pakistan's perspective. Shake it again  and you get the British perspective. You have to separate fact from bias  right. Even my books on children have cute  fuzzy animals. But they're playing geopolitics. They're playing out Israel Palestine  India Pakistan. You know  I'm making a very important argument. And my argument  is  that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage. After all  children's books are manuals on parenting  so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives. And conversely  only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy. You know  I can't promise my child a life without bias    we're all biased    but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. Thank you very much. My topic is economic growth in China and India. And the question I want to explore with you is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth. You may say this is not fair  because I'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy. Actually  exactly the opposite is what I'm going to do. I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy  rather than against democracy. The first question there is why China has grown so much faster than India. Over the last    years  in terms of the GDP growth rates  China has grown at twice the rate of India. In the last five years  the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth. But over the last    years  China undoubtedly has done much better than India. One simple answer is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai. Look at the skyline of Shanghai. This is the Pudong area. The picture on India is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai in India. The idea there behind these two pictures is that the Chinese government can act above rule of law. It can plan for the long term benefits of the country and in the process  evict millions of people    that's just a small technical issue. Whereas in India  you cannot do that  because you have to listen to the public. You're being constrained by the public's opinion. Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agrees with that view. In an interview printed in the financial press of India  He said that he wants to make Mumbai another Shanghai. This is an Oxford trained economist steeped in humanistic values  and yet he agrees with the high pressure tactics of Shanghai. So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth  that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic development  infrastructures  airports  highways  bridges  things like that. And you need a strong government to do that  because you cannot respect private property rights. You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion. You need also state ownership  especially of land assets  in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly. The implication of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth  rather than a facilitator of economic growth. Here's the key question. Just how important are infrastructures for economic growth  This is a key issue. If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth  then you would argue a strong government is necessary to promote growth. If you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe  then you will put less emphasis on strong government. So to illustrate that question  let me give you two countries. And for the sake of brevity  I'll call one country Country   and the other country Country  . Country   has a systematic advantage over Country   in infrastructures. Country   has more telephones  and Country   has a longer system of railways. So if I were to ask you   Which is China and which is India  and which country has grown faster   if you believe in the infrastructure view  then you will say   Country   must be China. They must have done better  in terms of economic growth. And Country   is possibly India.  Actually the country with more telephones is the Soviet Union  and the data referred to     . After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones  the country collapsed. That's not too good. The picture there is Khrushchev. I know that in      he no longer ruled the Soviet Union  but that's the best picture that I can find. Telephones  infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth. Country    that has fewer telephones  is China. Since       the country has performed at a double digit rate every year for the last    years. If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union other than the fact about their telephones  you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades. Country    that has a longer system of railways  is actually India. And Country   is China. This is a very little known fact about the two countries. Yes  today China has a huge infrastructure advantage over India. But for many years  until the late     s  China had an infrastructure disadvantage vis a vis India. In developing countries  the most common mode of transportation is the railways  and the British built a lot of railways in India. India is the smaller of the two countries  and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late     s. So clearly  infrastructure doesn't explain why China did better before the late     s  as compared with India. In fact  if you look at the evidence worldwide  the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth. The economy grows  government accumulates more resources  and the government can invest in infrastructure    rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth. And this is clearly the story of the Chinese economic growth. Let me look at this question more directly. Is democracy bad for economic growth  Now let's turn to two countries  Country A and Country B. Country A  in       had about      per capita GDP as compared with Country B  which had      in per capita GDP. By       Country A has surpassed Country B with      per capita GDP as compared with      per capita GDP. Both countries are in Asia. If I were to ask you   Which are the two Asian countries  And which one is a democracy   you may argue   Well  maybe Country A is China and Country B is India.  In fact  Country A is democratic India  and Country B is Pakistan    the country that has a long period of military rule. And it's very common that we compare India with China. That's because the two countries have about the same population size. But the more natural comparison is actually between India and Pakistan. Those two countries are geographically similar. They have a complicated  but shared common history. By that comparison  democracy looks very  very good in terms of economic growth. So why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments  One reason is the East Asian Model. In East Asia  we have had successful economic growth stories such as Korea  Taiwan  Hong Kong and Singapore. Some of these economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the   s and   s and     s. The problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries   Have you won the lottery   And they all tell you   Yes  we have won the lottery.  And then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are     percent. The reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn't end up winning the prize. For each of these successful authoritarian governments in East Asia  there's a matched failure. Korea succeeded  North Korea didn't. Taiwan succeeded  China under Mao Zedong didn't. Burma didn't succeed. The Philippines didn't succeed. If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide  there's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth. So the East Asian model has this massive selection bias    it is known as selecting on a dependent variable  something we always tell our students to avoid. So exactly why did China grow so much faster  I will take you to the Cultural Revolution  when China went mad  and compare that country's performance with India under Indira Gandhi. The question there is  Which country did better  China or India  China was during the Cultural Revolution. It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution  China out perfomed India in terms of GDP growth by an average of about  .  percent every year in terms of per capita GDP. So that's when China was mad. The whole country went mad. It must mean that the country had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth to overcome the negative effects of the Cultural Revolution. The advantage the country had was human capital    nothing else but human capital. This is the world development index indicator data in the early     s. And this is the earliest data that I can find. The adult literacy rate in China is    percent as compared with    percent in India. The contrast in literacy rates is especially sharp between Chinese women and Indian women. I haven't told you about the definition of literacy. In China  the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write       Chinese characters. In India  the definition of literacy  operating definition of literacy  is the ability  the grand ability  to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak. The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated. If you go to other sources of data such as Human Development Index  that data series  go back to the early     s  you see exactly the same contrast. China held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis a vis India. Life expectancies  as early as       China had a huge advantage in life expectancy. On average  as a Chinese in       you lived    years more than an average Indian. So if you have a choice between being a Chinese and being an Indian  you would want to become a Chinese in order to live    years longer. If you made that decision in       the down side of that is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution. So you have to always think carefully about these decisions. If you cannot chose your nationality  then you will want to become an Indian man. Because  as an Indian man  you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis a vis Indian women. This is an extremely strange fact. It's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern. It shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the Indian society against women. The good news is  by       India has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy. Today  Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over Indian men. So India is reverting to the normal. But India still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality. These are the two pictures taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province and garment factories in India. In China  it's all women.    to    percent of the workforce in China is women in the coastal part of the country  whereas in India  it's all men. Financial Times printed this picture of an Indian textile factory with the title   India Poised to Overtake China in Textile.  By looking at these two pictures  I say no  it won't overtake China for a while. If you look at other East Asian countries  women there play a hugely important role in terms of economic take off    in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with East Asia. India still has a long way to go to catch up with China. Then the issue is  what about the Chinese political system  You talk about human capital  you talk about education and public health. What about the political system  Isn't it true that the one party political system has facilitated economic growth in China  Actually  the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that. It depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system. Statically  China is a one party system  authoritarian    there's no question about it. Dynamically  it has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic. When you explain change    for example  economic growth  economic growth is about change    when you explain change  you use other things that have changed to explain change  rather than using the constant to explain change. Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change  but a fixed effect only explains changes in interaction with the things that change. In terms of the political changes  they have introduced village elections. They have increased the security of proprietors. And they have increased the security with long term land leases. There are also financial reforms in rural China. There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China. To me  the pace of political changes is too slow  too gradual. And my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges  because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms. But nevertheless  the system has moved in a more liberal direction  moved in a more democratic direction. You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India. In fact  when India was growing at a Hindu rate of growth    about one percent  two percent a year    that was when India was least democratic. Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in     . The Indian government owned and operated all the TV stations. A little known fact about India in the     s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms  the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self rule  privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts. So the dynamic perspective fits both with China and in India in terms of the direction. Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster  One reason is they are always comparing India with China. But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth. If you are a NBA player and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan  you're going to look not so impressive. But that doesn't mean that you're a bad basketball player. Comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark. In fact  if you compare India with the average developing country  even before the more recent period of acceleration of Indian growth    now India is growing between eight and nine percent    even before this period  India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies. This is a very impressive record indeed. Let's think about the future  the dragon vis a vis the elephant. Which country has the growth momentum  China  I believe  still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals    mostly the social capital  the public health  the sense of egalitarianism that you don't find in India. But I believe that India has the momentum. It has the improving fundamentals. The government has invested in basic education  has invested in basic health. I believe the government should do more  but nevertheless  the direction it is moving in is the right direction. India has the right institutional conditions for economic growth  whereas China is still struggling with political reforms. I believe that the political reforms are a must for China to maintain its growth. And it's very important to have political reforms  to have widely shared benefits of economic growth. I don't know whether that's going to happen or not  but I'm an optimist. Hopefully  five years from now  I'm going to report to TEDGlobal that political reforms will happen in China. Thank you very much. Now this is a very un TED like thing to do  but let's kick off the afternoon with a message from a mystery sponsor. Anonymous  Dear Fox News  it has come to our unfortunate attention that both the name and nature of Anonymous has been ravaged. We are everyone. We are no one. We are anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. We are but the base of chaos. Misha Glenny  Anonymous  ladies and gentlemen    a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in     . And they're pretty scary. You never know when they're going to attack next  who or what the consequences will be. But interestingly  they have a sense of humor. These guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account to announce President Obama's assassination. Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom at Fox.  What do we do now  Put on a black armband  or crack open the champagne   And of course  who could escape the irony of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. being a victim of hacking for a change. Sometimes you turn on the news and you say   Is there anyone left to hack   Sony Playstation Network    done  the government of Turkey    tick  Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency    a breeze  the CIA    falling off a log. In fact  a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world  those that know they've been hacked  and those that don't. I mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the FBI have been hacked. Is nothing sacred anymore  for heaven's sake  Anyway  this mysterious group Anonymous    and they would say this themselves    they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data. But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous    they are ideologically driven. They claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy. They say that governments are trying to take over the Internet and control it  and that they  Anonymous  are the authentic voice of resistance    be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships  against global media corporations  or against intelligence agencies  or whoever it is. And their politics are not entirely unattractive. Okay  they're a little inchoate. There's a strong whiff of half baked anarchism about them. But one thing is true  we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the Internet. The Web links everything  and very soon it will mediate most human activity. Because the Internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an old age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom. Now this is a very complicated struggle. And unfortunately  for mortals like you and me  we probably can't understand it very well. Nonetheless  in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago  I decided I would try and do that. And I sort of get it. These were the various things that I was looking at as I was trying to understand it. But in order to try and explain the whole thing  I would need another    minutes or so to do it  so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion  and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other  but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around. So there you are. And as you see  in the middle  there is our old friend  the hacker. The hacker is absolutely central to many of the political  social and economic issues affecting the Net. And so I thought to myself   Well  these are the guys who I want to talk to.  And what do you know  nobody else does talk to the hackers. They're completely anonymous  as it were. So despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions  hundreds of billions of dollars  into cybersecurity    for the most extraordinary technical solutions    no one wants to talk to these guys  the hackers  who are doing everything. Instead  we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions  which cost a huge amount of money. And so nothing is going into the hackers. Well  I say nothing  but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in Turin  Italy called the Hackers Profiling Project. And they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics  into the abilities and the socialization of hackers. But because they're a U.N. operation  maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them. Because it's a U.N. operation  of course  it lacks funding. But I think they're doing very important work. Because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry  we have a definite lack of    call me old fashioned    human intelligence. Now  so far I've mentioned the hackers Anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group. Of course  the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals. But interestingly  Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain. But what about the real cybercriminals  Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about    years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website  which led to the industrialization of cybercrime. Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet. This is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the Net. Now CarderPlanet was very interesting. Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details  to exchange information about new malware that was out there. And remember  this is a time when we're seeing for the first time so called off the shelf malware. This is ready for use  out of the box stuff  which you can deploy even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker. And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals. And its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial  because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals. And that challenge is  How do you do business  how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they're a criminal  It's axiomatic that they're dodgy  and they're going to want to try and rip you off. So the family  as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known  came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system. They appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser. The vendor  say  had stolen credit card details  the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them. The purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally  and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details. And the officer would then verify if the stolen credit card worked. And if they did  he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser. And it was this which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web. And after that  it just went wild. We had a champagne decade for people who we know as Carders. Now I spoke to one of these Carders who we'll call RedBrigade    although that wasn't even his proper nickname    but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was. And he explained to me how in      and      he would go on sprees in New York  taking out         from an ATM here          from an ATM there  using cloned credit cards. He was making  on average a week              tax free of course. And he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper East side apartment at one point that he just didn't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression. But that's a slightly different story  which I won't go into now. Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade is that he wasn't an advanced hacker. He sort of understood the technology  and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a Carder  but he didn't spend his days and nights bent over a computer  eating pizza  drinking coke and that sort of thing. He was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life. And this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise. And often they're the most vulnerable element of all. And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research. Dimitry Golubov  aka SCRIPT    born in Odessa  Ukraine in     . Now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the     s. This was a sink or swim environment where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities was entirely necessary if you wanted to survive. As an accomplished computer user  what Dimitry did was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown onto the Worldwide Web. And he did a great job in it. You have to understand though that from his ninth birthday  the only environment he knew was gangsterism. He knew no other way of making a living and making money. Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam  aka JiLsi    founder of DarkMarket  born in Colombo  Sri Lanka. As an eight year old  he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city  looking for Tamils like Renu to murder. At     he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military  accused of being a terrorist  and his parents sent him on his own to Britain as a refugee seeking political asylum. At     with only little English and being bullied at school  he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability  but he was soon being seduced by people on the Internet. He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud  and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London in     . Matrix     who was an administrator at DarkMarket. Born in Southern Germany to a stable and well respected middle class family  his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking. And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated. His slide into criminality was incremental. And when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications  he was already in too deep. Max Vision  aka ICEMAN    mastermind of CardersMarket. Born in Meridian  Idaho. Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of Santa Clara  California in the late   s for private companies and voluntarily for the FBI. Now in the late     s  he discovered a vulnerability on all U.S. government networks  and he went in and patched it up    because this included nuclear research facilities    sparing the American government a huge security embarrassment. But also  because he was an inveterate hacker  he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl. But this was spotted by an eagle eye investigator  and he was convicted. At his open prison  he came under the influence of financial fraudsters  and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release. And this man with a planetary sized brain is now serving a    year sentence in California. Adewale Taiwo  aka FreddyBB    master bank account cracker from Abuja in Nigeria. He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup  bankfrauds yahoo.co.uk before arriving in Britain in      to take a Masters in chemical engineering at Manchester University. He impressed in the private sector  developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in     . And then finally  Cagatay Evyapan  aka Cha     one of the most remarkable hackers ever  from Ankara in Turkey. He combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal. One of the smartest people I've ever met. He also had the most effective virtual private network security arrangement the police have ever encountered amongst global cybercriminals. Now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come from very different environments. They are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid teens. They are all people who demonstrate advanced ability in maths and the sciences. Remember that  when they developed those hacking skills  their moral compass had not yet developed. And most of them  with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha   they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world    only on the Web. And the other thing is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are consistent with Asperger's syndrome. Now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron Cohen who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge. And he has done path breaking work on autism and confirmed  also for the authorities here  that Gary McKinnon    who is wanted by the United States for hacking into the Pentagon    suffers from Asperger's and a secondary condition of depression. And Baron Cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills  and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped. Now I think we're missing a trick here  because I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail. And let me be blunt about this. In China  in Russia and in loads of other countries that are developing cyber offensive capabilities  this is exactly what they are doing. They are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities    are mobilizing them on behalf of the state. We need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people  because they are a remarkable breed. And if we rely  as we do at the moment  solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences  we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame. Thank you very much for listening. Chris Anderson  So your idea worth spreading is hire hackers. How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole  MG  I think to an extent  you have to understand that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that. They're just relentless and obsessive about what they do. But all of the people who I've spoken to who have fallen foul of the law  they have all said   Please  please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry. We just never knew how to get there  what we were doing. We want to work with you.  Chris Anderson  Okay  well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha. My name is Kate Hartman. And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate. So I'm specifically interested in how we  as humans  relate to ourselves  each other and the world around us. So just to give you a bit of context  as June said  I'm an artist  a technologist and an educator. I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics. And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form. And so anytime I talk about what I do  I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter. And it's pretty simple. Everybody's got one    all of you. I can guarantee  everyone in this room  all of you over there  the people in the cushy seats  the people up top with the laptops    we all have bodies. Don't be ashamed. It's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world. And so when working as an interaction designer  or as an artist who deals with participation    creating things that live on  in or around the human form    it's really a powerful space to work within. So within my own work  I use a broad range of materials and tools. So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing. And to tell you a bit about the things that I make  the easiest place to start the story is with a hat. And so it all started several years ago  late one night when I was sitting on the subway  riding home  and I was thinking. And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little. And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises    like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head    if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else. And so I went home  and I made a prototype of this hat. And I called it the Muttering Hat  because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you  but you could detach them and share them with somebody else. So I make other hats as well. This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat. It's fairly self explanatory. It physically carves out conversation space for one. And when you speak out loud  the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears. And so when I make these things  it's really not so much about the object itself  but rather the negative space around the object. So what happens when a person puts this thing on  What kind of an experience do they have  And how are they transformed by wearing it  So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves. So this particular device is called the Gut Listener. And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards. And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication. And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves. So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions. So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst. And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences. So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments. And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange  but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered. And in the end  some of these things just act as invitations. So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say. So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people  I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us. And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back  I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them. And I thought   Well  hey  Maybe if I want to better relate to walls  maybe I need to be more wall like myself.  So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack. And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me. And so jumping off of that  thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world  I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls    which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols. So when a plant is thirsty  it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter. And so this really shifts the human plant dynamic  because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time. And so kind of thinking about scale  my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers    of course. And so glaciers are these magnificent beings  and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them  but what I'm particularly interested in is in human glacier relations. Because there seems to be an issue. The glaciers are actually leaving us. They're both shrinking and retreating    and some of them have disappeared altogether. And so I actually live in Canada now  so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers. And this one's particularly interesting  because  of all the glaciers in North America  it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year. They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier. And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter. When I meet a glacier for the very first time  what do I do  There's no kind of social protocol for this. I really just don't even know how to say hello. Do I carve a message in the snow  Or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes    ice cube Morse code. Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool  like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice. But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening  which is what we need in any good relationship. And I was really struck by how much it affected me. This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier. And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days  I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit. And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice. And once again  it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug. So  yea  this is actually just the beginning. These are initial musings for this project. And just as with the wall  how I wanted to be more wall like  with this project  I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace. And so my intent is to actually just take the next    years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines    artists  technologists  scientists    to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human glacier relations. So beyond that  in closing  I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation  and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy  but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen  I present to you the human genome. Chromosome one  top left. Bottom right are the sex chromosomes. Women have two copies of that big X chromosome  men have the X and  of course  that small copy of the Y. Sorry boys  but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different. So if you zoom in on this genome  then what you see  of course  is this double helix structure    the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters  or we call them bases  right  A  C  G and T. How many are there in the human genome  Three billion. Is that a big number  Well  everybody can throw around big numbers. But in fact  if I were to place one base on each pixel of this      by     resolution screen  we would need       screens to take a look at the genome. So it's really quite big. And perhaps because of its size  a group of people    all  by the way  with Y chromosomes    decided they would want to sequence it. And so    years  actually  and about four billion dollars later  the genome was sequenced and published. In       the final version was published  and they keep working on it. That was all done on a machine that looks like this. It costs about a dollar for each base    a very slow way of doing it. Well folks  I'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it. So now what we do is we take a genome  we make maybe    copies of it  we cut all those copies up into little    base reads  and then we sequence them  massively parallel. And then we bring that into software  and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is. And so just to give you a picture of what this looks like  the Human Genome Project    gigabases  right. One run on one of these machines      gigabases in a week. And that     is going to change to     this summer  and there's no sign of this pace slowing. So the price of a base  to sequence a base  has fallen     million times. That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in       waiting until       and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice. World population  PC placements  the archive of all the medical literature  Moore's law  the old way of sequencing  and here's all the new stuff. Guys  this is a log scale  you don't typically see lines that go up like that. So the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like        to         human genomes this year. And we know this based on the machines that are being placed. This is expected to double  triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future. In fact  there's one lab in particular that represents    percent of all that capacity. It's called the Beijing Genomics Institute. The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon  by the way. What does this mean for medicine  So a woman is age   . She presents with stage   estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. She is treated with surgery  chemotherapy and radiation. She goes home. Two years later  she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer. Unfortunately  treated again with surgery and chemotherapy. She comes back three years later at age    with more ovarian cancer  more chemotherapy. Six months later  she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia. She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later. So first  the way in which this woman was treated  in as little as    years  will look like bloodletting. And it's because of people like my colleague  Rick Wilson  at the Genome Institute at Washington University  who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem. And he sequenced  he took skin cells  healthy skin  and cancerous bone marrow  and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks  no big deal. And then he compared those two genomes in software  and what he found  among other things  was a deletion  a       base deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called TP  . If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene  you're    percent likely to get cancer in your life. So unfortunately  this doesn't help this woman  but it does have severe  profound if you will  implications to her family. I mean  if they have the same mutation  and they get this genetic test  and they understand it  then they can go and get regular screens  and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life. Let me introduce you now to the Beery twins  diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two. Their mom is a very brave woman who didn't believe that the symptoms weren't matching up  and through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching  she was able to convince the medical community that  in fact  they had something else. What they had was dopa responsive dystonia. And so they were given L Dopa  and their symptoms did improve  but they weren't totally asymptomatic. Significant problems remained. Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery  who was lucky enough to be the CIO of a company called Life Technologies. They're one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools. And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced. And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR  which is responsible for producing serotonin  among other things. So on top of L Dopa  they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug  and they're effectively normal now. Guys  this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing. And at the time    this was a few years ago    it cost         . Today it's        . Next year it's       . The year after it's       give or take a year. That's how fast this is moving. So here's little Nick    likes Batman and squirt guns. And it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim. And it's not that he's not eating  it's that when he eats  his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut. So a hundred surgeries later  he looks at his mom and says   Mom  please pray for me. I'm in so much pain.  His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what's going on  but he says   Let's get this kid's genome sequenced.  And what they find is a single point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death. So the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction to what's going on to the food essentially  and that's a natural reaction  which causes some programmed cell death. But the gene that regulates that down is broken. And so this informs  among other things  of course  a treatment for bone marrow transplant  which he undertakes. And after nine months of grueling recovery  he's now eating steak with A  sauce. The prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today. Today  it's here. And what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five         years just because of this one thing. Which is a fantastic story  unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production. So it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn  wheat  soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought  of flood  of pests and pesticides. Now look  as long as we continue to increase the population  we're going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods  and that's the only position that I'll take today. Unless there's anybody in the audience that would like to volunteer to stop eating  None  not one. This is a typewriter  a staple of every desktop for decades. And in fact  the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing. And then more general versions of word processors came about. But ultimately  it was a disruption on top of a disruption. It was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything. And suddenly we had Netscape  and we had Yahoo and we had  indeed  the entire dotcom bubble. Not to worry though  that was quickly rescued by the iPod  Facebook and  indeed  angry birds. Look  this is where we are today. This is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are. So what I'd like you to consider is  What does it mean when these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome  but they connect to genomes all across the planet  So I just recently had to buy life insurance. And I was required to answer  A. I have never had a genetic test  B. I've had one  here you go  and C. I've had one and I'm not telling. Thankfully  I was able to answer A  and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening. But what would have happened if I had said C  Consumer applications for genomics  they will flourish. Do you want to see whether you're genetically compatible with your girlfriend  Sure. DNA sequencing on your iPhone  There's an app for that. Personalized genomic massage anyone  There's already a lab today that tests for allele     of the AVPR  gene  the so called cheating gene. So anybody who's here today with your significant other  just turn over to them and swab their mouth  send it to the lab and you'll know for sure. Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy  Now think of it  it's      and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns  but also her personal genome. And it looks really good. And then she challenges all of her competitors to do the same. Do you think that's not going to happen  Do you think it would have helped John McCain  How many people in the audience have the last name Resnick like me  Raise your hand. Anybody  Nobody. Typically  there's one or two. So my father's father was one of    Resnick brothers. They all hated each other. And they all moved to different parts of the planet. So it's likely that I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet  but I don't know. But imagine if my genome were deidentified  sitting in software  and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there  and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations. Not hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now. And so imagine one more thing  that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consents   Would you be willing to meet your third cousin   And if we both say yes  voila  Welcome to chromosomally LinkedIn. Now this is probably a good thing  right  You have bigger clan gatherings and so on. But maybe it's a bad thing as well. How many fathers in the room  Raise your hands. Okay  so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child. Look    These genomes  these    chromosomes  they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society    at least not yet. And like any new technology  it's really in humanity's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind  or not. And so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you. Thank you. I want to say that really and truly  after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread  I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television. So most everyone watches TV. We like it. We like some parts of it. Here in America  people actually love TV. The average American watches TV for almost   hours a day. Okay  Now I happen to make my living these days in television  so for me  that's a good thing. But a lot of people don't love it so much. They  in fact  berate it. They call it stupid  and worse  believe me. My mother  growing up  she called it the  idiot box.  But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV  my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience. So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral  political  social and emotional need states of our nation    that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system. So all these things are uniquely human  and they all add up to our idea of conscience. Now today  we're not talking about good and bad TV. We're talking about popular TV. We're talking about top    Nielsen rated shows over the course of    years. How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about  which is the idea of our social  collective unconscious  but how do these top    Nielsen rated shows over    years reflect the idea of our social conscience  How does television evolve over time  and what does this say about our society  Now speaking of evolution  from basic biology  you probably remember that the animal kingdom  including humans  have four basic primal instincts. You have hunger  you have sex  you have power  and you have the urge for acquisitiveness. As humans  what's important to remember is that we've developed  we've evolved over time to temper  or tame  these basic animal instincts. We have the capacity to laugh and cry. We feel awe  we feel pity. That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom. The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained. We love to watch TV. This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom. Animals might love to play  but they don't love to watch. So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious. Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has  I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders. Is television literally functioning as our conscience  tempting us and rewarding us at the same time  So to begin to answer these questions  we did a research study. We went back    years to the           television season. We surveyed the top    Nielsen shows every year for    years    a thousand shows. We talked to over       individuals    almost          aged    to     and we asked them how they felt emotionally. How did you feel watching every single one of these shows  Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity  Did you feel outrage  Did you laugh  What did this mean for you  So to our global TED audiences  I want to say that this was a U.S. sample. But as you can see  these emotional need states are truly universal. And on a factual basis  over    percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows are exported around the world. So I really hope our global audiences can relate. Two acknowledgments before our first data slide  For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis  I thank legendary rabbi  Jack Stern. And for the way in which I'm going to present the data  I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling  who you may have just seen. Okay  here we go. So here you see  from      to       the    years of our study. Two things we're going to start with    the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state  which  for this purpose  we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me  that make me feel much more positive about the world. Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong. As we start  you see in      inspiration is holding steady. That's what we're watching TV for. Moral ambiguity starts to climb. Right at the end of the   s  moral ambiguity is going up  inspiration is kind of on the wane. Why  The Cuban Missile Crisis  JFK is shot  the Civil Rights movement  race riots  the Vietnam War  MLK is shot  Bobby Kennedy is shot  Watergate. Look what happens. In       inspiration plummets. Moral ambiguity takes off. They cross  but Ronald Reagan  a telegenic president  is in office. It's trying to recover. But look  it can't  AIDS  Iran Contra  the Challenger disaster  Chernobyl. Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from      for the next    years. Take a look at this. This chart is going to document a very similar trend. But in this case  we have comfort    the bubble in red    social commentary and irreverence in blue and green. Now this time on TV you have  Bonanza   don't forget  you have  Gunsmoke   you have  Andy Griffith   you have domestic shows all about comfort. This is rising. Comfort stays whole. Irreverence starts to rise. Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up. You get to       and look what happens. You have comfort  irreverence  and social commentary  not only battling it out in our society  but you literally have two establishment shows     Gunsmoke  and  Gomer Pyle     in      are the number two  and number three rated television shows. What's number one  The socially irreverent hippie show   Rowan and Martin's Laugh In.  They're all living together  right. Viewers had responded dramatically. Look at this green spike in      to a bellwether show. When you guys hear this industry term  a breakout hit  what does that mean  It means in the      television season  The  Smothers Brothers  came out of nowhere. This was the first show that allowed viewers to say   My God  I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War  about the presidency  through television   That's what we mean by a breakout show. So then  just like the last chart  look what happens. In       the dam bursts. The dam bursts. Comfort is no longer why we watch television. Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the   s. Now look at this. The   s means who  Norman Lear. You have  All in the Family    Sanford and Son   and the dominant show    in the top    for the entire   s     MAS H.  In the entire    years of television that we studied  seven of    shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War  five of the top    during the Nixon administration. Only one generation     years in  and we discovered  Wow  TV can do that  It can make me feel this  It can change us  So to this very  very savvy crowd  I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive. Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us    years ago. This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute  fantasy and imagination  which are shows defined as   takes me out of my everyday realm  and  makes me feel better.  That's mapped against the red dot  unemployment  which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic. You'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise  it maps to a spike in unemployment. Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed  No. In the   s you have the bellwether show  The Bionic Woman  that rocketed into the top    in       followed by the  Six Million Dollar Man  and  Charlie's Angels.  Another spike in the     s    another spike in shows about control and power. What were those shows  Glamorous and rich.  Dallas    Fantasy Island.  Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts  unemployment. So here you are  in my favorite chart  because this is our last    years. Whether or not you're in my business  you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV. Well  as we say in the business  X marks the spot. The   s    the big bubbles of humor    we're watching  Friends    Frasier    Cheers  and  Seinfeld.  Everything's good  low unemployment. But look  X marks the spot. In       the September      television season  humor succumbs to judgment once and for all. Why not  We had a      presidential election decided by the Supreme Court. We had the bursting of the tech bubble. We had     . Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon. Look what happens when we keep going. At the turn of the century  the Internet takes off  reality television has taken hold. What do people want in their TV then  I would have thought revenge or nostalgia. Give me some comfort  my world is falling apart. No  they want judgment. I can vote you off the island. I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing. I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired. That's all great  right  So as dramatically different as these television shows  pure entertainment  have been over the last    years    what did I start with     one basic instinct remains. We're animals  we need our moms. There has not been a decade of television without a definitive  dominant TV mom. The     s  June Cleever in the original comfort show   Leave it to Beaver.  Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the   s. Maude Findlay  the epitome of the irreverent     s  who tackled abortion  divorce  even menopause on TV. The     s  our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington. Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood. This era's mom  Bree Van de Kamp. Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience  sitting on television's shoulders  but I do know that I absolutely love this image. So to you all  the women of TEDWomen  the men of TEDWomen  the global audiences of TEDWomen  thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television. But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television. They give it life on television  for sure  but it's you as viewers  through your collective social consciences  that give it life  longevity  power or not. So thanks very much. Let's talk about billions. Let's talk about past and future billions. We know that about     billion people have ever lived. And we know that most of them are dead. And we also know that most of them live or lived in Asia. And we also know that most of them were or are very poor    did not live for very long. Let's talk about billions. Let's talk about the         billion dollars of wealth in the world today. We know that most of that wealth was made after the year     . And we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call Westerners  Europeans  North Americans  Australasians.    percent of the world's population today  Westerners own two thirds of its wealth. Economic historians call this  The Great Divergence.  And this slide here is the best simplification of the Great Divergence story I can offer you. It's basically two ratios of per capita GDP  per capita gross domestic product  so average income. One  the red line  is the ratio of British to Indian per capita income. And the blue line is the ratio of American to Chinese. And this chart goes back to     . And you can see here that there's an exponential Great Divergence. They start off pretty close together. In fact  in       the average Chinese was richer than the average North American. When you get to the     s  which is where this chart ends  the average Briton is more than    times richer than the average Indian. And that's allowing for differences in the cost of living. It's based on purchasing power parity. The average American is nearly    times richer than the average Chinese by the     s. So why  This wasn't just an economic story. If you take the    countries that went on to become the Western empires  in      they were really quite tiny    five percent of the world's land surface     percent of its population  maybe    percent of its income. By       these    countries  plus the United States  controlled vast global empires       percent of the world's territory  about the same percentage of its population  and a really huge  nearly three quarters share of global economic output. And notice  most of that went to the motherland  to the imperial metropoles  not to their colonial possessions. Now you can't just blame this on imperialism    though many people have tried to do so    for two reasons. One  empire was the least original thing that the West did after     . Everybody did empire. They beat preexisting Oriental empires like the Mughals and the Ottomans. So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation for the Great Divergence. In any case  as you may remember  the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the     s  some considerable time after decolonization. This is not a new question. Samuel Johnson  the great lexicographer   posed  it through his character Rasselas in his novel  Rasselas  Prince of Abissinia   published in     .  By what means are the Europeans thus powerful  or why  since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa for trade or conquest  cannot the Asiaticks and Africans invade their coasts  plant colonies in their ports  and give laws to their natural princes  The same wind that carries them back would bring us thither   That's a great question. And you know what  it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the Resterners    by the people in the rest of the world    like Ibrahim Muteferrika  an Ottoman official  the man who introduced printing  very belatedly  to the Ottoman Empire    who said in a book published in        Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with Muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies   Unlike Rasselas  Muteferrika had an answer to that question  which was correct. He said it was  because they have laws and rules invented by reason.  It's not geography. You may think we can explain the Great Divergence in terms of geography. We know that's wrong  because we conducted two great natural experiments in the   th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions. We took all the Germans  we divided them roughly in two  and we gave the ones in the East communism  and you see the result. Within an incredibly short period of time  people living in the German Democratic Republic produced Trabants  the Trabbi  one of the world's worst ever cars  while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz. If you still don't believe me  we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula. And we decided we'd take Koreans in roughly the same geographical place with  notice  the same basic traditional culture  and we divided them in two  and we gave the Northerners communism. And the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in Germany. Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly  but in almost every other respect  it's a huge divergence. Which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character  popular explanations for this kind of thing  are really significant. It's the ideas. It's the institutions. This must be true because a Scotsman said it. And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED. So let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman. He was Adam Smith    not Billy Connolly  not Sean Connery    though he is very smart indeed. Smith    and I want you to go and bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile  it's a wonderful statue    Smith  in the  Wealth of Nations  published in         that's the most important thing that happened that year ... You bet. There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies  but ...  China seems to have been long stationary  and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions. But this complement may be much inferior to what  with other laws and institutions  the nature of its soil  climate  and situation might admit of.  That is so right and so cool. And he said it such a long time ago. But you know  this is a TED audience  and if I keep talking about institutions  you're going to turn off. So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand. Let's call them the killer apps. I want to explain to you that there were six killer apps that set the West apart from the rest. And they're kind of like the apps on your phone  in the sense that they look quite simple. They're just icons  you click on them. But behind the icon  there's complex code. It's the same with institutions. There are six which I think explain the Great Divergence. One  competition. Two  the scientific revolution. Three  property rights. Four  modern medicine. Five  the consumer society. And six  the work ethic. You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at  or try and boil it down to just four  but you'll lose. Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this  synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process. Competition means  not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in       but within each of these units  there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns. The ancestor of the modern corporation  the City of London Corporation  existed in the   th century. Nothing like this existed in China  where there was one monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity  and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination  which took three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters and very complex Confucian essay writing. The scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world in a number of crucial ways  the most important being that  through the experimental method  it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before. Example  Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application of Newtonian physics to ballistics. Once you do that  your artillery becomes accurate. Think of what that means. That really was a killer application. Meanwhile  there's no scientific revolution anywhere else. The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe  but there's no scientific revolution there. In fact  they demolish Taqi al Din's observatory  because it's considered blasphemous to inquire into the mind of God. Property rights  It's not the democracy  folks  it's having the rule of law based on private property rights. That's what makes the difference between North America and South America. You could turn up in North America having signed a deed of indenture saying   I'll work for nothing for five years. You just have to feed me.  But at the end of it  you've got a hundred acres of land. That's the land grant on the bottom half of the slide. That's not possible in Latin America where land is held onto by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors. And you can see here the huge divergence that happens in property ownership between North and South. Most people in rural North America owned some land by     . Hardly anyone in South America did. That's another killer app. Modern medicine in the late   th century began to make major breakthroughs against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people. And this was another killer app    the very opposite of a killer  because it doubled  and then more than doubled  human life expectancy. It even did that in the European empires. Even in places like Senegal  beginning in the early   th century  there were major breakthroughs in public health  and life expectancy began to rise. It doesn't rise any faster after these countries become independent. The empires weren't all bad. The consumer society is what you need for the Industrial Revolution to have a point. You need people to want to wear tons of clothes. You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month  I guarantee it. That's the consumer society  and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself. Japan was the first non Western society to embrace it. The alternative  which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi  was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent. Very few Indians today wish that India had gone down Mahatma Gandhi's road. Finally  the work ethic. Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant. He was wrong. Any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work. We know this because today the work ethic is no longer a Protestant  Western phenomenon. In fact  the West has lost its work ethic. Today  the average Korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average German    a thousand. And this is part of a really extraordinary phenomenon  and that is the end of the Great Divergence. Who's got the work ethic now  Take a look at mathematical attainment by    year olds. At the top of the international league table according to the latest PISA study  is the Shanghai district of China. The gap between Shanghai and the United Kingdom and the United States is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S. and Albania and Tunisia. You probably assume that because the iPhone was designed in California but assembled in China that the West still leads in terms of technological innovation. You're wrong. In terms of patents  there's no question that the East is ahead. Not only has Japan been ahead for some time  South Korea has gone into third place  and China is just about to overtake Germany. Why  Because the killer apps can be downloaded. It's open source. Any society can adopt these institutions  and when they do  they achieve what the West achieved after         only faster. This is the Great Reconvergence  and it's the biggest story of your lifetime. Because it's on your watch that this is happening. It's our generation that is witnessing the end of Western predominance. The average American used to be more than    times richer than the average Chinese. Now it's just five times  and soon it will be  .  times. So I want to end with three questions for the future billions  just ahead of       when the United States will lose its place as number one economy to China. The first is  can you delete these apps  and are we in the process of doing so in the Western world  The second question is  does the sequencing of the download matter  And could Africa get that sequencing wrong  One obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy before you've established secure private property rights. Warning  that may not work. And third  can China do without killer app number three  That's the one that John Locke systematized when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law. That's the basis for the Western model of representative government. Now this picture shows the demolition of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio in Shanghai earlier this year. He's now free again  having been detained  as you know  for some time. But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt. Winston Churchill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of     . And I think these words really nail it   It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians. It means that violence  the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs  the conditions of camps and warfare  of riot and tyranny  give place to parliaments where laws are made  and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained. That is civilization    and in its soil grow continually freedom  comfort and culture   what all TEDsters care about most.  When civilization reigns in any country  a wider and less harassed life is afforded to the masses of the people.  That's so true. I don't think the decline of Western civilization is inevitable  because I don't think history operates in this kind of life cycle model  beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's  Course of Empire  paintings. That's not the way history works. That's not the way the West rose  and I don't think it's the way the West will fall. The West may collapse very suddenly. Complex civilizations do that  because they operate  most of the time  on the edge of chaos. That's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations. No  we may hang on  despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated  despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo. But one thing is for sure  the Great Divergence is over  folks. Thanks very much. Bruno Giussani  Niall  I am just curious about your take on the other region of the world that's booming  which is Latin America. What's your view on that  Niall Ferguson  Well I really am not just talking about the rise of the East  I'm talking about the rise of the Rest  and that includes South America. I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard   Hey  is South America part of the West   He was an expert in Latin American history. He said   I don't know  I'll have to think about that.  That tells you something really important. I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular  but also Chile  which was in many ways the one that led the way in transforming the institutions of economic life  there's a very bright future indeed. So my story really is as much about that convergence in the Americas as it's a convergence story in Eurasia. BG  And there is this impression that North America and Europe are not really paying attention to these trends. Mostly they're worried about each other. The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow. The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow. And that's all we seem to be caring about recently. NF  I think the fiscal crisis that we see in the developed World right now    both sides of the Atlantic    is essentially the same thing taking different forms in terms of political culture. And it's a crisis that has its structural facet    it's partly to do with demographics. But it's also  of course  to do with the massive crisis that followed excessive leverage  excessive borrowing in the private sector. That crisis  which has been the focus of so much attention  including by me  I think is an epiphenomenon. The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon  which has just accelerated this huge shift  which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy. I think that's its real importance. BG  Niall  thank you.  NF  Thank you very much  Bruno.  Erez Lieberman Aiden  Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. But we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true. So we assembled a team of experts  spanning Harvard  MIT  The American Heritage Dictionary  The Encyclopedia Britannica and even our proud sponsors  the Google. And we cogitated about this for about four years. And we came to a startling conclusion. Ladies and gentlemen  a picture is not worth a thousand words. In fact  we found some pictures that are worth     billion words. Jean Baptiste Michel  So how did we get to this conclusion  So Erez and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history  change over time. So many books actually have been written over the years. So we were thinking  well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books. Now of course  if there's a scale for how awesome that is  that has to rank extremely  extremely high. Now the problem is there's an X axis for that  which is the practical axis. This is very  very low. Now people tend to use an alternative approach  which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully. This is extremely practical  but not so awesome. What you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space. So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach. They have digitized millions of books. So what that means is  one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button. That's very practical and extremely awesome. ELA  Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from. Since time immemorial  there have been authors. These authors have been striving to write books. And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago. Since then  the authors have won on     million distinct occasions  publishing books. Now if those books are not lost to history  then they are somewhere in a library  and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google  which has scanned    million books to date. Now when Google digitizes a book  they put it into a really nice format. Now we've got the data  plus we have metadata. We have information about things like where was it published  who was the author  when was it published. And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data. What we're left with is a collection of five million books      billion words  a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome    a text which  when written out  would stretch from here to the Moon and back    times over    a veritable shard of our cultural genome. Of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ... was what any self respecting researchers would have done. We took a page out of XKCD  and we said   Stand back. We're going to try science.  JM  Now of course  we were thinking  well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it. Now we're thinking  what data can we release  Well of course  you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million books. Now Google  and Jon Orwant in particular  told us a little equation that we should learn. So you have five million  that is  five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit. So  although that would be really  really awesome  again  that's extremely  extremely impractical. Now again  we kind of caved in  and we did the very practical approach  which was a bit less awesome. We said  well instead of releasing the full text  we're going to release statistics about the books. So take for instance  A gleam of happiness.  It's four words  we call that a four gram. We're going to tell you how many times a particular four gram appeared in books in                   all the way up to     . That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time. We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books  and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing. ELA  So those two billion lines  we call them two billion n grams. What do they tell us  Well the individual n grams measure cultural trends. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose that I am thriving  then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did. And so I might say   Yesterday  I throve.  Alternatively  I could say   Yesterday  I thrived.  Well which one should I use  How to know  As of about six months ago  the state of the art in this field is that you would  for instance  go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair  and you'd say   Steve  you're an expert on the irregular verbs. What should I do   And he'd tell you   Well most people say thrived  but some people say throve.  And you also knew  more or less  that if you were to go back in time     years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair   Tom  what should I say   He'd say   Well  in my day  most people throve  but some thrived.  So now what I'm just going to show you is raw data. Two rows from this table of two billion entries. What you're seeing is year by year frequency of  thrived  and  throve  over time. Now this is just two out of two billion rows. So the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide. JM  Now there are many other pictures that are worth     billion words. For instance  this one. If you just take influenza  you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe. ELA  If you were not yet convinced  sea levels are rising  so is atmospheric CO  and global temperature. JM  You might also want to have a look at this particular n gram  and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead  although you might agree that he might need a better publicist. ELA  You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing. For instance  let me tell you the history of the year     . Pretty much for the vast majority of history  no one gave a damn about     . In       in       in       no one cared. Through the   s and   s  no one cared. Suddenly  in the mid   s  there started to be a buzz. People realized that      was going to happen  and it could be big. But nothing got people interested in      like the year     . People were walking around obsessed. They couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in       all the things they were planning to do in       all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in     . In fact       was so fascinating that for years thereafter  people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened  in '    '    '  . Finally in       someone woke up and realized that      had gotten somewhat pass . And just like that  the bubble burst. And the story of      is the story of every year that we have on record  with a little twist  because now we've got these nice charts. And because we have these nice charts  we can measure things. We can say   Well how fast does the bubble burst   And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely. Equations were derived  graphs were produced  and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year. We are losing interest in the past more rapidly. JM  Now a little piece of career advice. So for those of you who seek to be famous  we can learn from the    most famous political figures  authors  actors and so on. So if you want to become famous early on  you should be an actor  because then fame starts rising by the end of your   s    you're still young  it's really great. Now if you can wait a little bit  you should be an author  because then you rise to very great heights  like Mark Twain  for instance  extremely famous. But if you want to reach the very top  you should delay gratification and  of course  become a politician. So here you will become famous by the end of your   s  and become very  very famous afterward. So scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older. Like for instance  biologists and physics tend to be almost as famous as actors. One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician. If you do that  you might think   Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my   s.  But guess what  nobody will really care. ELA  There are more sobering notes among the n grams. For instance  here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall  an artist born in     . And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person. He gets more and more and more famous  except if you look in German. If you look in German  you see something completely bizarre  something you pretty much never see  which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets  going through a nadir between      and       before rebounding afterward. And of course  what we're seeing is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany. Now these signals are actually so strong that we don't need to know that someone was censored. We can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing. Here's a simple way to do it. Well  a reasonable expectation is that somebody's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after. So that's sort of what we expect. And we compare that to the fame that we observe. And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index. If the suppression index is very  very  very small  then you very well might be being suppressed. If it's very large  maybe you're benefiting from propaganda. JM  Now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations. So for instance  here    this suppression index is for       people picked in English books where there's no known suppression    it would be like this  basically tightly centered on one. What you expect is basically what you observe. This is distribution as seen in Germany    very different  it's shifted to the left. People talked about it twice less as it should have been. But much more importantly  the distribution is much wider. There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about    times fewer than they should have been. But then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda. This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record. ELA  So culturomics is what we call this method. It's kind of like genomics. Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome. Culturomics is similar. It's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture. Here  instead of through the lens of a genome  through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record. The great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it. Why can everyone do it  Everyone can do it because three guys  Jon Orwant  Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google  saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer  and they said   This is so fun. We have to make this available for people.  So in two weeks flat    the two weeks before our paper came out    they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public. And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its n gram immediately    also browse examples of all the various books in which your n gram appears. JM  Now this was used over a million times on the first day  and this is really the best of all the queries. So people want to be their best  put their best foot forward. But it turns out in the   th century  people didn't really care about that at all. They didn't want to be their best  they wanted to be their beft. So what happened is  of course  this is just a mistake. It's not that strove for mediocrity  it's just that the S used to be written differently  kind of like an F. Now of course  Google didn't pick this up at the time  so we reported this in the science article that we wrote. But it turns out this is just a reminder that  although this is a lot of fun  when you interpret these graphs  you have to be very careful  and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences. ELA  People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes. Actually  we're not going to have to talk  we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent. This person was interested in the history of frustration. There's various types of frustration. If you stub your toe  that's a one A  argh.  If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass  that's an eight A  aaaaaaaargh.  This person studies all the  arghs   from one through eight A's. And it turns out that the less frequent  arghs  are  of course  the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating    except  oddly  in the early   s. We think that might have something to do with Reagan. JM  There are many usages of this data  but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized. Google has started to digitize    million books. That's    percent of all the books that have ever been published. It's a sizable chunk of human culture. There's much more in culture  there's manuscripts  there newspapers  there's things that are not text  like art and paintings. These all happen to be on our computers  on computers across the world. And when that happens  that will transform the way we have to understand our past  our present and human culture. Thank you very much. I am a reformed marketer  and I now work in international development. In October  I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo  which is the  second  largest country in Africa. In fact  it's as large as Western Europe  but it only has     miles of paved roads. The DRC is a dangerous place. In the past    years  five million people have died due to a war in the east. But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC. There are many health issues as well. In fact  the HIV prevalence rate is  .  percent among adults. This might not sound like a large number  but in a country with    million people  it means there are         that are infected. And due to the poor infrastructure  only    percent of those are receiving the life saving drugs that they need. Which is why  in part  donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost. And so while I was in the DRC  I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms  including Damien. Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa. It's a hotel that's only open until midnight  so it's not a place that you stay. But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come. Now Damien knows all about condoms  but he doesn't sell them. He said there's just not in demand. It's not surprising  because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms. Joseph and Christine  who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms  said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost  and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them  their customers don't buy the branded versions. They like the generics. And as a marketer  I found that curious. And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like. And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms  fear  financing and fidelity. They name the condoms things like Vive   to live  or Trust. They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV  put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them  show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently. Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom. What is it that you think about just before you get a condom  Sex  And the private companies that sell condoms in these places  they understand this. Their marketing is slightly different. The name might not be much different  but the imagery sure is. Some brands are aspirational  and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative. And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing  understanding who's the audience. And for donor agencies  unfortunately  the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working  in . It's people back home  people that support their work  people like these. But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV  we need to think about the customer  the people whose behavior needs to change    the couples  the young women  the young men    whose lives depend on it. And so the lesson is this  it doesn't really matter what you're selling  you just have to think about who is your customer  and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior. It might just save their lives. Thank you. Everyone's familiar with cancer  but we don't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease. The Tasmanian devil has shown us that  not only can cancer be a contagious disease  but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction. So first of all  what is a Tasmanian devil  Many of you might be familiar with Taz  the cartoon character  the one that spins around and around and around. But not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil  and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial. A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo. The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes. The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger  and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.  The  Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania  which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia. And despite their ferocious appearance  Tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals. In fact  growing up in Tasmania  it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a Tasmanian devil in the wild. But the Tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline. And in fact  there's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within    to    years. And the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease  a contagious cancer. The story begins in      when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a Tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face. At the time  this was thought to be a one off. Animals  just like humans  sometimes get strange tumors. However  we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease  which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania. The disease was first sighted in the northeast of Tasmania in      and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave. Now there's only a small part of the population  which remains unaffected. This disease appears first as tumors  usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils. These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors  such as these ones here. And the next image I'm going to show is quite gruesome. But inevitably  these tumors progress towards being enormous  ulcerating tumors like this one here. This one in particular sticks in my mind  because this is the first case of this disease that I saw myself. And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating  foul smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw. She hadn't eaten for days. Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms. Her body was riddled with secondary tumors. And yet  she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils in her pouch. Of course  they died along with the mother. They were too young to survive without their mother. In fact  in the area where she comes from  more than    percent of the Tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease. Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer  this infectious cancer  that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population. And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women  which is spread by a virus  and to the AIDS epidemic  which is associated with a number of different types of cancer. All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus. However  we now know    and I'll tell you right now    that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus. In fact  the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister  and something that we hadn't really thought of before. But in order for me to explain what that is  I need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself. Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year. One in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives. I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only   . Cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself. Paradoxically  once established  natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer. Natural selection is survival of the fittest. And when you have a population of fast dividing cancer cells  if one of them acquires new mutations  which allow them to grow more quickly  acquire nutrients more successfully  invade the body  they'll be selected for by evolution. That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat. It evolves. Throw a drug at it  and resistant cells will grow back. An amazing fact is that  given the right environment and the right nutrients  a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever. However cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies  and its continued growth  its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues  leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself. So cancer could be thought of as a strange  short lived  self destructive life form    an evolutionary dead end. But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation. And the answer came from studying the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA. This was work from many people  but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that I did a few years ago. The next slide is going to be gruesome. This is Jonas. He's a Tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face. And being a geneticist  I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations. So I took this opportunity to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body. I took these back to the lab. I extracted DNA from them. And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA  and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor to that of the rest of his body  I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile. In fact  Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you. What this told us was that Jonas' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body. In fact  more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil    and Jonas was clearly a male. So how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on Jonas' face  Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania. We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA. Think about that for a minute. That means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil  that have broken free of that first devil's body and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population. But how can a cancer spread in a population  Well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild. They tend to bite each other  often quite ferociously and usually on the face. We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor  get into the saliva. When the devil bites another devil  it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil  so the tumor continues to grow. So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer. It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it. It spreads through the population  has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system  and it's the only cancer that we know of that's threatening an entire species with extinction. But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils  why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans  Well the answer is  it has. This is Kimbo. He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya. Last year  his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region. She took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting. And if you're squeamish  please look away now. He discovered this  a huge bleeding tumor at the base of Kimbo's penis. The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor  a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs. And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells  so is this dog cancer. But this dog cancer is quite remarkable  because it spread all around the world. And in fact  these same cells that are affecting Kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in New York City  in mountain villages in the Himalayas and in Outback Australia. We also believe this cancer might be very old. In fact  genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old  which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the Neanderthals. This cancer is remarkable. It's the oldest mammalian derived life form that we know of. It's a living relic of the distant past. So we've seen that this can happen in animals. Could cancers be contagious between people  Well this is a question which fascinated Chester Southam  a cancer doctor in the     s. Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else. And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in      injecting cancer into a volunteer  who in this case was an inmate in Ohio State Penitentiary. Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells. But a small number of them did  and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill    whose immune systems were probably compromised. What this tells us  ethical issues aside  is that ... it's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people. However  under some circumstances  it can happen. And I think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future. So just finally  cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments. But that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer. In fact  I believe  given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth  we can defeat cancer. My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer. Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer. Thank you. So I just want to tell you my story. I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace. And naturally  I encounter a lot of resistance  because it's considered to be anti intellectual and counter to serious learning. But I have a problem with that belief  because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems. So I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is. So I discovered some very interesting things. For example  there's no such thing as a flattering definition of a doodle. In the   th century  a doodle was a simpleton or a fool    as in Yankee Doodle. In the   th century  it became a verb  and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone. In the   th century  it was a corrupt politician. And today  we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition  at least to me  which is the following  To doodle officially means to dawdle  to dilly dally  to monkey around  to make meaningless marks  to do something of little value  substance or import  and    my personal favorite    to do nothing. No wonder people are averse to doodling at work. Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work  it's totally inappropriate. Additionally  I've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them  of course  for doodling in classrooms. And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom. There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something. And unfortunately  the press tends to reinforce this norm when they're reporting on a doodling scene    of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like    they typically use words like  discovered  or  caught  or  found out   as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed. And additionally  there is a psychological aversion to doodling    thank you  Freud. In the     s  Freud told us all that you could analyze people's psyches based on their doodles. This is not accurate  but it did happen to Tony Blair at the Davos Forum in       when his doodles were  of course   discovered  and he was labeled the following things. Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle. And Bill  if you're here  nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal. But that does contribute to people not wanting to share their doodles. And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe. I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling. And I'm not comfortable with that. And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst  I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth. And here's the truth  doodling is an incredibly powerful tool  and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re learn. So here's a new definition for doodling. And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary  because I want to talk to you later. Here's the real definition  Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think. That is why millions of people doodle. Here's another interesting truth about the doodle  People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non doodling counterparts. We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus  but in reality  it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus. Additionally  it has a profound effect on creative problem solving and deep information processing. There are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions. They are visual  auditory  reading and writing and kinesthetic. Now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it  we have to engage at least two of those modalities  or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience. The incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience. That is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing. This is so nerdy  but this made me cry when I discovered this. So they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children  and they found that  across space and time  all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic as they grow. In other words  they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order. And I think that is incredible. I think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct. And finally  a lot a people aren't privy to this  but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets. This is but one  this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi. So here is my point  Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room. On the contrary  doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high. And I will go you one further. Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form  it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy. My friends  the doodle has never been the nemesis of intellectual thought. In reality  it is one of its greatest allies. Thank you. A few months ago  a    year old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where I live  and she was brought in confused. Her blood pressure was an alarming     over    . Within a few minutes  she went into cardiac collapse. She was resuscitated  stabilized  whisked over to a CAT scan suite right next to the emergency room  because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung. And the CAT scan revealed no blood clots in the lung  but it showed bilateral  visible  palpable breast masses  breast tumors  that had metastasized widely all over the body. And the real tragedy was  if you look through her records  she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years. Four or five opportunities to see the breast masses  touch the breast mass  intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her. Ladies and gentlemen  that is not an unusual story. Unfortunately  it happens all the time. I joke  but I only half joke  that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb  no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan  MRI or orthopedic consult. I am not a Luddite. I teach at Stanford. I'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology. But I'd like to make the case to you in the next    minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam  when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient  we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable  early stage  but we're losing much more than that. We're losing a ritual. We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative  transcendent  and is at the heart of the patient physician relationship. This may actually be heresy to say this at TED  but I'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation  I think  in medicine to come in the next    years  and that is the power of the human hand    to touch  to comfort  to diagnose and to bring about treatment. I'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize. This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Since we're in Edinburgh  I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle. You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school here in Edinburgh  and his character  Sherlock Holmes  was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell. Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts. And Conan Doyle  writing about Bell  described the following exchange between Bell and his students. So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department  students all around him  patients signing up in the emergency room and being registered and being brought in. And a woman comes in with a child  and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange. The woman says   Good Morning.  Bell says   What sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from Burntisland   She says   It was good.  And he says   What did you do with the other child   She says   I left him with my sister at Leith.  And he says   And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row to get here to the infirmary   She says   I did.  And he says   Would you still be working at the linoleum factory   And she says   I am.  And Bell then goes on to explain to the students. He says   You see  when she said  'Good morning ' I picked up her Fife accent. And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland. And so she must have taken the ferry over. You notice that the coat she's carrying is too small for the child who is with her  and therefore  she started out the journey with two children  but dropped one off along the way. You notice the clay on the soles of her feet. Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh  except in the botanical gardens. And therefore  she took a short cut down Inverleith Row to arrive here. And finally  she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand  a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland.  And when Bell actually strips the patient  begins to examine the patient  you can only imagine how much more he would discern. And as a teacher of medicine  as a student myself  I was so inspired by that story. But you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way  using our senses  is quite recent. The picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger who  in the late     s  discovered percussion. And the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger was the son of an innkeeper. And his father used to go down into the basement to tap on the sides of casks of wine to determine how much wine was left and whether to reorder. And so when Auenbrugger became a physician  he began to do the same thing. He began to tap on the chests of his patients  on their abdomens. And basically everything we know about percussion  which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day    organ enlargement  fluid around the heart  fluid in the lungs  abdominal changes    all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript  Inventum Novum    New Invention   which would have disappeared into obscurity  except for the fact that this physician  Corvisart  a famous French physician    famous only because he was physician to this gentleman    Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work. And it was followed a year or two later by Laennec discovering the stethoscope. Laennec  it is said  was walking in the streets of Paris and saw two children playing with a stick. One was scratching at the end of the stick  another child listened at the other end. And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called  the cylinder.  Later he renamed it the stethoscope. And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born. So within a few years  in the late     s  early     s  all of a sudden  the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis. If you'll recall  prior to that time  no matter what ailed you  you went to see the barber surgeon who wound up cupping you  bleeding you  purging you. And  oh yes  if you wanted  he would give you a haircut    short on the sides  long in the back    and pull your tooth while he was at it. He made no attempt at diagnosis. In fact  some of you might well know that the barber pole  the red and white stripes  represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon  and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected. But the arrival of auscultation and percussion represented a sea change  a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body. And this particular painting  I think  represents the pinnacle  the peak  of that clinical era. This is a very famous painting   The Doctor  by Luke Fildes. Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate  who then established the Tate Gallery. And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting of social importance. And it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic. Fildes' oldest son  Philip  died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve after a brief illness. And Fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two  three nights  that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time    almost a tribute to this physician. And hence the painting  The Doctor   a very famous painting. It's been on calendars  postage stamps in many different countries. I've often wondered  what would Fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era  in the year       Would he have substituted a computer screen for where he had the patient  I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer. I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer. I call it the iPatient. The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America. The real patient often wonders  where is everyone  When are they going to come by and explain things to me  Who's in charge  There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care. I want to show you a picture of what rounds looked like when I was in training. The focus was around the patient. We went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge. Too often these days  rounds look very much like this  where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient. The discussion is all about images on the computer  data. And the one critical piece missing is that of the patient. Now I've been influenced in this thinking by two anecdotes that I want to share with you. One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer  had a small breast cancer detected    had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived. This is when I was in Texas. And she then spent a lot of time researching to find the best cancer center in the world to get her subsequent care. And she found the place and decided to go there  went there. Which is why I was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town  getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist. And I pressed her  and I asked her   Why did you come back and get your care here   And she was reluctant to tell me. She said   The cancer center was wonderful. It had a beautiful facility  giant atrium  valet parking  a piano that played itself  a concierge that took you around from here to there. But   she said   but they did not touch my breasts.  Now you and I could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts. They had her scanned inside out. They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level  they had no need to touch her breasts. But to her  it mattered deeply. It was enough for her to make the decision to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist who  every time she went  examined both breasts including the axillary tail  examined her axilla carefully  examined her cervical region  her inguinal region  did a thorough exam. And to her  that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed. I was very influenced by that anecdote. I was also influenced by another experience that I had  again  when I was in Texas  before I moved to Stanford. I had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue. This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy. I say that because these are difficult patients. They have often been rejected by their families  have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who's about to disappoint them. And I learned very early on with my first patient that I could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of    minutes. There was just no way. And if I tried  I'd disappoint them. And so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit  and I tried not to interrupt them. We know the average American physician interrupts their patient in    seconds. And if I ever get to heaven  it will be because I held my piece for    minutes and did not interrupt my patient. I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence  and when the patient came for the physical  I was able to do a thorough physical  because I had nothing else to do. I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam  but because the whole visit was now about the physical  I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam. And I remember my very first patient in that series continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit. And I began my ritual. I always begin with the pulse  then I examine the hands  then I look at the nail beds  then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node  and I was into my ritual. And when my ritual began  this very voluble patient began to quiet down. And I remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and I had slipped back into a primitive ritual in which I had a role and the patient had a role. And when I was done  the patient said to me with some awe   I have never been examined like this before.  Now if that were true  it's a true condemnation of our health care system  because they had been seen in other places. I then proceeded to tell the patient  once the patient was dressed  the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions  which is   This is not in your head. This is real. The good news  it's not cancer  it's not tuberculosis  it's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection. The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this  but here's what you should do  here's what we should do.  And I would lay out all the standard treatment options that the patient had heard elsewhere. And I always felt that if my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor  the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness  it was because I had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination. Something of importance had transpired in the exchange. I took this to my colleagues at Stanford in anthropology and told them the same story. And they immediately said to me   Well you are describing a classic ritual.  And they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation. We marry  for example  with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss. I'm not sure why you're laughing. That was the original intent  was it not  We signal transitions of power with rituals. We signal the passage of a life with rituals. Rituals are terribly important. They're all about transformation. Well I would submit to you that the ritual of one individual coming to another and telling them things that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi  and then  incredibly on top of that  disrobing and allowing touch    I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance. And if you shortchange that ritual by not undressing the patient  by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown  by not doing a complete exam  you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient physician relationship. I am a writer  and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote that has to do very much with this scene. I'm an infectious disease physician  and in the early days of HIV  before we had our medications  I presided over so many scenes like this. I remember  every time I went to a patient's deathbed  whether in the hospital or at home  I remember my sense of failure    the feeling of I don't know what I have to say  I don't know what I can say  I don't know what I'm supposed to do. And out of that sense of failure  I remember  I would always examine the patient. I would pull down the eyelids. I would look at the tongue. I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart. I would feel the abdomen. I remember so many patients  their names still vivid on my tongue  their faces still so clear. I remember so many huge  hollowed out  haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual. And then the next day  I would come  and I would do it again. And I wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient.  I recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin  unable to speak  his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications. When he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth  his hands moved as if in slow motion. And as I wondered what he was up to  his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt  fumbling with his buttons. I realized that he was wanting to expose his wicker basket chest to me. It was an offering  an invitation. I did not decline. I percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest. I think he surely must have known by then that it was vital for me just as it was necessary for him. Neither of us could skip this ritual  which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung  or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure. No  this ritual was about the one message that physicians have needed to convey to their patients. Although  God knows  of late  in our hubris  we seem to have drifted away. We seem to have forgotten    as though  with the explosion of knowledge  the whole human genome mapped out at our feet  we are lulled into inattention  forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician  necessary for the patient    forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient. And the message  which I didn't fully understand then  even as I delivered it  and which I understand better now is this  I will always  always  always be there. I will see you through this. I will never abandon you. I will be with you through the end.  Thank you very much. What I want to talk about today is one idea. It's an idea for a new kind of school  which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work. And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon. Where it comes from is an organization called the Young Foundation  which  over many decades  has come up with many innovations in education  like the Open University and things like Extended Schools  Schools for Social Entrepreneurs  Summer Universities and the School of Everything. And about five years ago  we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the U.K. And we felt the most important priority was to bring together two sets of problems. One was large numbers of bored teenagers who just didn't like school  couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school and future jobs. And employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work  didn't have the right attitudes and experience. And so we try to ask  What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in  not fighting to stay out  And after hundreds of conversations with teenagers and teachers and parents and employers and schools from Paraguay to Australia  and looking at some of the academic research  which showed the importance of what's now called non cognitive skills    the skills of motivation  resilience    and that these are as important as the cognitive skills    formal academic skills    we came up with an answer  a very simple answer in a way  which we called the Studio School. And we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance where work and learning are integrated. You work by learning  and you learn by working. And the design we came up with had the following characteristics. First of all  we wanted small schools    about          pupils       to    year olds  and critically  about    percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms  but through real life  practical projects  working on commission to businesses  NGO's and others. That every pupil would have a coach  as well as teachers  who would have timetables much more like a work environment in a business. And all of this will be done within the public system  funded by public money  but independently run. And all at no extra cost  no selection  and allowing the pupils the route into university  even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs and have manual jobs as well. Underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things  they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real    all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does. Now that was a nice idea  so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase. We tried it out  first in Luton    famous for its airport and not much else  I fear    and in Blackpool    famous for its beaches and leisure. And what we found    and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then improved them    but we found that the young people loved it. They found it much more motivational  much more exciting than traditional education. And perhaps most important of all  two years later when the exam results came through  the pupils who had been put on these field trials who were in the lowest performing groups had jumped right to the top    in fact  pretty much at the top decile of performance in terms of GCSE's  which is the British marking system. Now not surprisingly  that influenced some people to think we were onto something. The minister of education down south in London described himself as a  big fan.  And the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real life work today. And indeed  the head of the Chambers of Commerce is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust and helping it  not just with big businesses  but small businesses all over the country. We started with two schools. That's grown this year to about   . And next year  we're expecting about    schools open across England  and another    areas want to have their own schools opening    a pretty rapid spread of this idea. Interestingly  it's happened almost entirely without media coverage. It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it. It spread almost entirely through word of mouth  virally  across teachers  parents  people involved in education. And it spread because of the power of an idea    so the very  very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal  things like working in teams  doing practical projects  and putting them right at the heart of learning  rather than on the edges. Now there's a whole set of new schools opening up this autumn. This is one from Yorkshire where  in fact  my nephew  I hope  will be able to attend it. And this one is focused on creative and media industries. Other ones have a focus on health care  tourism  engineering and other fields. We think we're onto something. It's not perfect yet  but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands  possibly millions  of teenagers who are really bored by schooling. It doesn't animate them. They're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour. They want to do things  they want to get their hands dirty  they want education to be for real. And my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us. We feel we're on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the Studio School idea into something which is present  not as a universal answer for every child  but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world. And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen. Thank you very much. I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana  West Africa. Ghana felt safe to me as a child. I was free  I was happy. The early   s marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana. But then by the end of the decade  the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement. In       I witnessed my first military coup. We the children had gathered at a friend's house. It was a dimly lit shack. There was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background  and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole. The firing squad aimed  fired    the general was dead. Now this was being broadcast live. And shortly after  we left the country  and we returned to Switzerland. Now Europe came as a shock to me  and I think I started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in. I wanted to blend in like a chameleon. I think it was a tactic of survival. And it worked  or so I believed. So here I was in      wondering where I was in my life. And I felt I was being typecast as an actor. I was always playing the exotic African. I was playing the violent African  the African terrorist. And I was thinking  how many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself  And I had become ashamed of the other  the African in me. And fortunately I decided in      to return to Ghana  after    years of absence. I wanted to document on film the      presidential elections. And there  I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood. And before I even knew it  I was suddenly on a stage surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political rally. And I realized that  when I'd left the country  free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream. And now that I'd returned  that dream had become reality  though a fragile reality. And I was thinking  was Ghana searching for its identity like I was looking for my identity  Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me  And it was as if through the standards of my Western life  I hadn't lived up to my full potential. I mean  nor had Ghana  even though we had been trying very hard. Now in       Ghana was the first sub Saharan country to gain its independence. In the late   s  Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP. I mean  today  Singapore is a First World country and Ghana is not. But maybe it was time to prove to myself  yes  it's important to understand the past  it is important to look at it in a different light  but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present. So here I was  December  th      . The polling stations opened to the voters at      AM  but voters  eager to take their own political fate into their hands  were starting to line up at      AM in the morning. And they had traveled from near  they had traveled from far  because they wanted to make their voices heard. And I asked one of the voters  I said   Whom are you going to vote for   And he said   I'm sorry  I can't tell you.  He said that his vote was in his heart. And I understood  this was their election  and they weren't going to let anyone take it away from them. Now the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner    so nobody had achieved the absolute majority    so voting went into a second round three weeks later. The candidates were back on the road  they were campaigning. The rhetoric of the candidates  of course  changed. The heat was on. And then the cliche came to haunt us. There were claims of intimidation at the polling stations  of ballot boxes being stolen. Inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control. We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets. People were being beaten brutally. The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling. It was complete chaos. And my heart sank  because I thought  here we are again. Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself. And not only that  I am documenting it    documenting my own cultural shortcomings. So when the echo of the gunshots had lingered  it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob  and I didn't believe what I was hearing. They were chanting   We want peace. We want peace.  And I realized it had to come from the people. After all  they decide  and they did. So the sounds that were before distorted and loud  were suddenly a melody. The sounds of the voices were harmonious. So it could happen. A democracy could be upheld peacefully. It could be  by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace. Now here's an interesting comparison. We in the West  we preach the values  the golden light of democracy  that we are the shining example of how it's done. But when it comes down to it  Ghana found itself in the same place in which the U.S. election stalled in the      presidential elections    Bush versus Gore. But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide  Ghana honored democracy and its people. It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide  the people did. Now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either. I mean  it was so incredibly close. The electoral commissioner declared  with the consent of the parties  to run an unprecedented second re run. So the people went back to the polls to determine their own president  not the legal system. And guess what  it worked. The defeated candidate gave up power and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle. I mean  at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy  they did not abuse their power. The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep  proving that the African is capable of governing himself. Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over  but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists  and that we must not take it for granted. Now I have learned that my place is not just in the West or in Africa  and I'm still searching for my identity  but I saw Ghana create democracy better. Ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently. And yes  we Africans can. Thank you. So I'm a doctor  but I kind of slipped sideways into research  and now I'm an epidemiologist. And nobody really knows what epidemiology is. Epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you. And it's best understood through example as the science of those crazy  wacky newspaper headlines. And these are just some of the examples. These are from the Daily Mail. Every country in the world has a newspaper like this. It has this bizarre  ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer. So here are some of the things they said cause cancer recently  divorce  Wi Fi  toiletries and coffee. Here are some of the things they say prevents cancer  crusts  red pepper  licorice and coffee. So already you can see there are contradictions. Coffee both causes and prevents cancer. And as you start to read on  you can see that maybe there's some kind of political valence behind some of this. So for women  housework prevents breast cancer  but for men  shopping could make you impotent. So we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this. And what I hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims  unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims  isn't a kind of nasty carping activity  it's socially useful  but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool. Because real science is all about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else's position. That's what happens in academic journals. That's what happens at academic conferences. The Q A session after a post op presents data is often a blood bath. And nobody minds that. We actively welcome it. It's like a consenting intellectual S M activity. So what I'm going to show you is all of the main things  all of the main features of my discipline    evidence based medicine. And I will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work  exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong. So we'll start with the absolute weakest form of evidence known to man  and that is authority. In science  we don't care how many letters you have after your name. In science  we want to know what your reasons are for believing something. How do you know that something is good for us or bad for us  But we're also unimpressed by authority  because it's so easy to contrive. This is somebody called Dr. Gillian McKeith Ph.D  or  to give her full medical title  Gillian McKeith. Again  every country has somebody like this. She is our TV diet guru. She has massive five series of prime time television  giving out very lavish and exotic health advice. She  it turns out  has a non accredited correspondence course Ph.D. from somewhere in America. She also boasts that she's a certified professional member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants  which sounds very glamorous and exciting. You get a certificate and everything. This one belongs to my dead cat Hetti. She was a horrible cat. You just go to the website  fill out the form  give them      and it arrives in the post. Now that's not the only reason that we think this person is an idiot. She also goes and says things like  you should eat lots of dark green leaves  because they contain lots of chlorophyll  and that will really oxygenate your blood. And anybody who's done school biology remembers that chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight  and it's quite dark in your bowels after you've eaten spinach. Next  we need proper science  proper evidence. So   Red wine can help prevent breast cancer.  This is a headline from the Daily Telegraph in the U.K.  A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer.  So you go and find this paper  and what you find is it is a real piece of science. It is a description of the changes in one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere. And that's a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper  but on the question of your own personal risk of getting breast cancer if you drink red wine  it tells you absolutely bugger all. Actually  it turns out that your risk of breast cancer actually increases slightly with every amount of alcohol that you drink. So what we want is studies in real human people. And here's another example. This is from Britain's leading diet and nutritionist in the Daily Mirror  which is our second biggest selling newspaper.  An Australian study in      found that olive oil in combination with fruits  vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings.  And then they give you advice   If you eat olive oil and vegetables  you'll have fewer skin wrinkles.  And they very helpfully tell you how to go and find the paper. So you go and find the paper  and what you find is an observational study. Obviously nobody has been able to go back to       get all the people born in one maternity unit  and half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil  and then half of them eat McDonald's  and then we see how many wrinkles you've got later. You have to take a snapshot of how people are now. And what you find is  of course  people who eat veg and olive oil have fewer skin wrinkles. But that's because people who eat fruit and veg and olive oil  they're freaks  they're not normal  they're like you  they come to events like this. They are posh  they're wealthy  they're less likely to have outdoor jobs  they're less likely to do manual labor  they have better social support  they're less likely to smoke    so for a whole host of fascinating  interlocking social  political and cultural reasons  they are less likely to have skin wrinkles. That doesn't mean that it's the vegetables or the olive oil. So ideally what you want to do is a trial. And everybody thinks they're very familiar with the idea of a trial. Trials are very old. The first trial was in the Bible    Daniel     . It's very straightforward    you take a bunch of people  you split them in half  you treat one group one way  you treat the other group the other way  and a little while later  you follow them up and see what happened to each of them. So I'm going to tell you about one trial  which is probably the most well reported trial in the U.K. news media over the past decade. And this is the trial of fish oil pills. And the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children. And they said   We've done a trial. All the previous trials were positive  and we know this one's gonna be too.  That should always ring alarm bells. Because if you already know the answer to your trial  you shouldn't be doing one. Either you've rigged it by design  or you've got enough data so there's no need to randomize people anymore. So this is what they were going to do in their trial. They were taking       children  they were going to give them all these huge fish oil pills  six of them a day  and then a year later  they were going to measure their school exam performance and compare their school exam performance against what they predicted their exam performance would have been if they hadn't had the pills. Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design  And no professors of clinical trial methodology are allowed to answer this question. So there's no control  there's no control group. But that sounds really techie. That's a technical term. The kids got the pills  and then their performance improved. What else could it possibly be if it wasn't the pills  They got older. We all develop over time. And of course  also there's the placebo effect. The placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine. It's not just about taking a pill  and your performance and your pain getting better. It's about our beliefs and expectations. It's about the cultural meaning of a treatment. And this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another. So we know  for example  that two sugar pills a day are a more effective treatment for getting rid of gastric ulcers than one sugar pill. Two sugar pills a day beats one sugar pill a day. And that's an outrageous and ridiculous finding  but it's true. We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill  taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it    not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body  but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention. So we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated  which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo    where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo. But that's not enough. What I've just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes. What I find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices  but slightly more sophisticated versions of them  in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients  and which we use to make vitally important decisions. So firstly  trials against placebo  everybody thinks they know that a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo. But actually in a lot of situations that's wrong. Because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available  so we don't want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing. We want to know that it's better than the best currently available treatment that we have. And yet  repeatedly  you consistently see people doing trials still against placebo. And you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it's better than nothing  which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision. But that's not the only way you can rig your data. You can also rig your data by making the thing you compare your new drug against really rubbish. You can give the competing drug in too low a dose  so that people aren't properly treated. You can give the competing drug in too high a dose  so that people get side effects. And this is exactly what happened which antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.    years ago  a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects. So people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs  but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses       milligrams a day of haloperidol. And it's a foregone conclusion  if you give a drug at that high a dose  that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better.    years ago  history repeated itself  interestingly  when risperidone  which was the first of the new generation antipscyhotic drugs  came off copyright  so anybody could make copies. Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone  so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day. Again  not an insane dose  not an illegal dose  but very much at the high end of normal. And so you're bound to make your new drug look better. And so it's no surprise that overall  industry funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials. But    and it's a big but    it turns out  when you look at the methods used by industry funded trials  that they're actually better than independently sponsored trials. And yet  they always manage to to get the result that they want. So how does this work  How can we explain this strange phenomenon  Well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action  it's withheld from doctors and patients. And this is the most important aspect of the whole story. It's at the top of the pyramid of evidence. We need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective. And there are two different ways that you can spot whether some data has gone missing in action. You can use statistics  or you can use stories. I personally prefer statistics  so that's what I'm going to do first. This is something called funnel plot. And a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared  have gone missing in action. So this is a graph of all of the trials that have been done on a particular treatment. And as you go up towards the top of the graph  what you see is each dot is a trial. And as you go up  those are the bigger trials  so they've got less error in them. So they're less likely to be randomly false positives  randomly false negatives. So they all cluster together. The big trials are closer to the true answer. Then as you go further down at the bottom  what you can see is  over on this side  the spurious false negatives  and over on this side  the spurious false positives. If there is publication bias  if small negative trials have gone missing in action  you can see it on one of these graphs. So you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared. This is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias. And I think that's the funniest epidemiology joke that you will ever hear. That's how you can prove it statistically  but what about stories  Well they're heinous  they really are. This is a drug called reboxetine. This is a drug that I myself have prescribed to patients. And I'm a very nerdy doctor. I hope I try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature. I read the trials on this. They were all positive. They were all well conducted. I found no flaw. Unfortunately  it turned out  that many of these trials were withheld. In fact     percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients. Now if you think about it  if I tossed a coin a hundred times  and I'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times  then I can convince you that I have a coin with two heads. If we remove half of the data  we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is. And this is not an isolated story. Around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld  but it goes way beyond that. The Nordic Cochrane Group were trying to get a hold of the data on that to bring it all together. The Cochrane Groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown. And they need to have access to all of the trial data. But the companies withheld that data from them  and so did the European Medicines Agency for three years. This is a problem that is currently lacking a solution. And to show how big it goes  this is a drug called Tamiflu  which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on. And they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug which will reduce the rate of complications with flu. We already have the data showing that it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours. But I don't really care about that. Governments don't care about that. I'm very sorry if you have the flu  I know it's horrible  but we're not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day. We prescribe these drugs  we stockpile them for emergencies on the understanding that they will reduce the number of complications  which means pneumonia and which means death. The infectious diseases Cochrane Group  which are based in Italy  has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not  and they've not been able to get that information. This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today. We cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information. So it's a little bit difficult from there to spin in some kind of positive conclusion. But I would say this  I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant. All of these things are happening in plain sight  and they're all protected by a force field of tediousness. And I think  with all of the problems in science  one of the best things that we can do is to lift up the lid  finger around in the mechanics and peer in. Thank you very much.
