Everybody talks about happiness these days. I had somebody count the number of books with  happiness  in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about     and there were many more. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness  among researchers. There is a lot of happiness coaching. Everybody would like to make people happier. But in spite of all this flood of work  there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness  and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness  because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. It turns out that the word  happiness  is just not a useful word anymore  because we apply it to too many different things. I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it  but by and large  this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is. The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory  basically  it's between being happy in your life  and being happy about your life or happy with your life. And those are two very different concepts  and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. And the third is the focusing illusion  and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance. I mean  this is a real cognitive trap. There's just no way of getting it right. Now  I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures reported a story  and that was a story    He said he'd been listening to a symphony  and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording  there was a dreadful screeching sound. And then he added  really quite emotionally  it ruined the whole experience. But it hadn't. What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. He had had the experience. He had had    minutes of glorious music. They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory  the memory was ruined  and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. What this is telling us  really  is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. There is an experiencing self  who lives in the present and knows the present  is capable of re living the past  but basically it has only the present. It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches    you know  when the doctor asks   Does it hurt now when I touch you here   And then there is a remembering self  and the remembering self is the one that keeps score  and maintains the story of our life  and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question   How have you been feeling lately   or  How was your trip to Albania   or something like that. Those are two very different entities  the experiencing self and the remembering self  and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. Now  the remembering self is a storyteller. And that really starts with a basic response of our memories    it starts immediately. We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. Our memory tells us stories  that is  what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. And let me begin with one example. This is an old study. Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days  but it was painful when this study was run in the     s. They were asked to report on their pain every    seconds. Here are two patients  those are their recordings. And you are asked   Who of them suffered more   And it's a very easy question. Clearly  Patient B suffered more    his colonoscopy was longer  and every minute of pain that Patient A had  Patient B had  and more. But now there is another question   How much did these patients think they suffered   And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different  and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great    but one of them is this distinct ...  Laughter  but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end  it's a bad story. How do we know that  Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy  and much later  too   How bad was the whole thing  in total   And it was much worse for A than for B  in memory. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the point of view of the experiencing self  clearly  B had a worse time. Now  what you could do with Patient A  and we actually ran clinical experiments  and it has been done  and it does work    you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much. That will cause the patient to suffer  but just a little and much less than before. And if you do that for a couple of minutes  you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off  and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off  because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience. What defines a story  And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us  and it's also true of the stories that we make up. What defines a story are changes  significant moments and endings. Endings are very  very important and  in this case  the ending dominated. Now  the experiencing self lives its life continuously. It has moments of experience  one after the other. And you can ask  What happens to these moments  And the answer is really straightforward  They are lost forever. I mean  most of the moments of our life    and I calculated  you know  the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long  that means that  you know  in a life there are about     million of them  in a month  there are about            most of them don't leave a trace. Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. And yet  somehow you get the sense that they should count  that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth. And how to spend it would seem to be relevant  but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us. So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self  and they're really quite distinct. The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing self  if you have a vacation  and the second week is just as good as the first  then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation. That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. For the remembering self  a two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added. You have not changed the story. And in this way  time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self  time has very little impact on the story. Now  the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions because  if you have a patient who has had  say  two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose  then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad  and that's the surgeon that will be chosen. The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. We actually don't choose between experiences  we choose between memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future  we don't think of our future normally as experiences. We think of our future as anticipated memories. And basically you can look at this  you know  as a tyranny of the remembering self  and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need. I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case  that is  we go on vacations  to a very large extent  in the service of our remembering self. And this is a bit hard to justify I think. I mean  how much do we consume our memories  That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self. And when I think about that  I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago  which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had  and I think of it relatively often  relative to how much I think of other vacations. And I probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip  I would say  for about    minutes in the last four years. Now  if I had ever opened the folder with the     pictures in it  I would have spent another hour. Now  that is three weeks  and that is at most an hour and a half. There seems to be a discrepancy. Now  I may be a bit extreme  you know  in how little appetite I have for consuming memories  but even if you do more of this  there is a genuine question  Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences  So I want you to think about a thought experiment. Imagine that for your next vacation  you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed  and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything. Now  would you choose the same vacation   Laughter  And if you would choose a different vacation  there is a conflict between your two selves  and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict  and it's actually not at all obvious  because if you think in terms of time  then you get one answer  and if you think in terms of memories  you might get another answer. Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves. Now  the two selves bring up two notions of happiness. There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply  one per self. So you can ask  How happy is the experiencing self  And then you would ask  How happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life  And they're all    happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process. What are the emotions that can be measured  And  by the way  now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self  it's a completely different thing. This is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life. Very different notion. Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness  and I belong to a crowd of students of well being  who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way. The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years  and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences  and there have been other efforts along those lines. So in recent years  we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different. You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life  and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life  and vice versa. Just to give you a sense of the correlation  the correlation is about . . What that means is if you met somebody  and you were told   Oh his father is six feet tall   how much would you know about his height  Well  you would know something about his height  but there's a lot of uncertainty. You have that much uncertainty. If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten  you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. So the correlation is low. We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. We know that money is very important  goals are very important. We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like  spending time with people that we like. There are other pleasures  but this is dominant. So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves  you are going to end up doing very different things. The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being. It is a completely different notion. Now  very quickly  another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life  and we actually live. So  if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California  you are not going to get to the correct answer. When you ask that question  you think people must be happier in California if  say  you live in Ohio. And what happens is when you think about living in California  you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places  and that contrast  say  is in climate. Well  it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are. But now  because the reflective self is in charge  you may end up    some people may end up moving to California. And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier. Well  their experiencing self is not going to get happier. We know that. But one thing will happen  They will think they are happier  because  when they think about it  they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio  and they will feel they made the right decision. It is very difficult to think straight about well being  and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I've got a question for you. Thank you so much. Now  when we were on the phone a few weeks ago  you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey. Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now  Daniel Kahneman  Sure. I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number  which we absolutely did not expect to find. We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. When we looked at how feelings  vary with income. And it turns out that  below an income of        dollars a year  for Americans    and that's a very large sample of Americans  like          so it's a large representative sample    below an income of         dollars a year... CA        . DK        .        dollars a year  people are unhappy  and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that  we get an absolutely flat line. I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat. Clearly  what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness  but lack of money certainly buys you misery  and we can measure that misery very  very clearly. In terms of the other self  the remembering self  you get a different story. The more money you earn  the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions. CA  But Danny  the whole American endeavor is about life  liberty  the pursuit of happiness. If people took seriously that finding  I mean  it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about  like for example  taxation policy and so forth. Is there any chance that politicians  that the country generally  would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it  DK  You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. The recognition is going to be slow in the United States  no question about that  but in the U.K.  it is happening  and in other countries it is happening. People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy. It's going to take a while  and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness  or whether they want to study life evaluation  so we need to have that debate fairly soon. How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think  and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self. This is going to influence policy  I think  in years to come. In the United States  efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population. This is going to be  I think  within the next decade or two  part of national statistics. CA  Well  it seems to me that this issue will    or at least should be    the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years. Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics. Thank you  Danny Kahneman. So  what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's    maybe the world's    longest running soap opera  which is cricket. And may it run forever  because it gives people like me a living. It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want  It's got love  joy  happiness  sadness  tears  laughter  lots of deceit  intrigue. And like all good soaps  it jumps    years when the audience interest changes. And that's exactly what cricket has done. It's jumped    years into    over game. And that's what I'm going to talk about  how a small change leads to a very big revolution. But it wasn't always like that. Cricket wasn't always this speed driven generations game. There was a time when you played cricket  you played timeless test matches  when you played on till the game got over. And there was this game in March      that started on the third of March and ended on the   th of March. And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town  which is a two hour train journey  to catch the ship that left on the   th  because the next ship wasn't around for a long time. So  the match was ended in between. And one of the English batsmen said   You know what  Another half an hour and we would have won.  Another half an hour after    days. There were two Sundays in between. But of course  Sundays are church days  so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained  so they all sat around making friends with each other. But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket  because we had about the same pace of life. The Mahabharata was like that as well  wasn't it  You fought by day  then it was sunset  so everyone went back home. And then you worked out your strategy  and you came and fought the next day  and you went back home again. The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket  everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day. Princes patronize the game  not because they love the game  but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers. But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket  which was  all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball  and any number of people could play it anywhere. Take a look  You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there  you could play it in a little alley    you couldn't hit square anywhere  because the bat hit the wall  don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires. You could play it on the banks of the Ganges    that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time. Or you could play many games in one small patch of land  even if you didn't know which game you were actually in. As you can see  you can play anywhere. But slowly the game moved on  you know  finally. You don't always have five days. So  we moved on  and we started playing    over cricket. And then an enormous accident took place. In Indian sport we don't make things happen  accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time  sometimes. And we won this World Cup in     . And suddenly we fell in love with the    over game  and we played it virtually every day. There was more    over cricket than anywhere. But there was another big date.      was when we won the World Cup.      '    we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India  rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country. And so we allowed multinationals into India. We cut customs duties  we reduced import duties  and we got all the multinationals coming in  with multinational budgets  who looked at per capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India  and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian. And there are only two vehicles in India    one real  one scripted. The scripted one is what you see in the movies  the real one was cricket. And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me  Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi  decided he's going to take it all over the world. And Pepsi was this big revolution  because they started taking cricket all over. And so cricket started becoming big  cricket started bringing riches in. Television started covering cricket. For a long time television said   We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it.  Then they said   OK  the next rights are sold for    million dollars. The next rights are sold for     million dollars.  So  it's a bit of a curve  that. And then another big accident happened in our cricket. England invented    overs cricket  and said   The world must play    overs cricket.  Just as England invented cricket  and made the rest of the world play it. Thank God for them. And so  India had to go and play the T   World Cup  you see. India didn't want to play the T   World Cup. But we were forced to play it by an     margin. And then something very dramatic happened. We got to the final  and then this moment  that will remain enshrined forever  for everybody  take a look. The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder. Announcer  And Zishan takes it  India wins  What a match for a Twenty   final. India  the world champions. India  T   champions. But what a game we had  M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air  but Misbah ul Haq  what a player. A massive  massive success  India  the world TT champions. Harsha Bhogle  Suddenly India discovered this power of    overs cricket. The accident  of course  there  was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast. If he had bowled fast  the ball would have gone where it was meant to go  but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game. And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world. It was at a time when investment was coming in  India was feeling a little more confident about itself. And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do. And thankfully for all of us  the English are very good at inventing things  and then the gracious people that they are  they let the world become very good at it. And so England invented T   cricket  and allowed India to hijack it. It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine  we just took it straight away  as is. And so  we launched our own T   league. Six weeks  city versus city. It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country    the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country  representing itself on the field. One was war  the Indian army  which we don't like to happen very often. The other was Indian cricket. Now  suddenly we had to support city leagues. But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West. America is a home of leagues. And they said   Right  we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India.  But was India ready for it  Because cricket  for a long time in India was always organized. It was never promoted  it was never sold    it was organized. And look what they did with our beautiful  nice  simple family game. All of a sudden  you had that happening. An opening ceremony to match every other. This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar. This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over. So  it was a different India. But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern  but didn't want to say that to people. And so  they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived. Everyone secretly watched them  but everyone claimed not to. The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes. They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it  these were people who ran serious companies. And so they started promoting cricket big time  started promoting clubs big time. And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it. I mean the IPL had  .  billion dollars before a ball was bowled   .  billion dollars for television revenue over    years  and another    million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities  but they had to do it like the West  right  Because we are setting up leagues. But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized. So  just to give you an example of how they did it    not Manchester United style promotion  but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look. Of course  a lot of people said   Maybe they dance better than they play.  But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket. All along  if you wanted a young cricketer  you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality  your own city  and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers. Now  all of the sudden  if you were to bowl a shot    if Mumbai were to bowl a shot  for example  they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them  they could go to Trinidad. This was the new India  wasn't it  This was the new world  where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price. And all of a sudden  Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world. So  the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago  overnight. And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies  they asked him   When do you have to reach   He said   I have to be there by a certain time  so I have to leave today.  We said   No  no  no. It's not about when you have to leave  it's about when do you have to reach there   And so he said   I've got to reach on date X.  And they said   Fine  you play to date X  minus one.  So  he played in Hyderabad  went  straight after the game  went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport  sat in a private corporate jet    first refueling in Portugal  second refueling in Brazil  he was in West Indies in time. Never would India have thought on this scale before. Never would India have said   I want a player to play one game for me  and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston  Jamaica to play a game.  And I just thought to myself   Wow  we've arrived somewhere in the world  you know  We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big.  But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket  which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment. There is cricket and the movies. And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs. And so  people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta. They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan. And something very interesting happened. We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket. And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more. And of course  if you were on Preity Zinta's team    as you will see on the clip that follows    if you did well  you got a hug from Preity Zinta. So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look    everyone's watching Preity Zinta. And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd. We'd all seen matches in Kolkata  but we'd never seen anything like this  Shah Rukh  with the Bengali song  getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata    not for India  but for Kolkata. But take a look at this. An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they'd won in Kolkata. Can you imagine  And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said   I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team.  But I thought I'd take this opportunity    there's a few people from Pakistan in here. I'm so happy that you're here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends  right  We can play cricket together  we can be friends. So thank you very much for coming  all of you from Pakistan. There was criticism too because they said   Players are being bought and sold  Are they grain  Are they cattle   Because we had this auction  you see. How do you fix a price for a player  And so the auction that followed literally had people saying   Bang  so many million dollars for so and so player.  There it is. Auctioneer  Going at           dollars. Chennai. Shane Warne sold for         dollars. HB  Suddenly  a game which earned its players    rupees a day    so     rupees for a test match  but if you finish in four days you only got    . The best Indian players who played every test match    every one of the internationals  the top of the line players    standard contracts are         dollars in a whole year. Now they were getting         for six days' work. Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England  he got one and a half million dollars  and he went back and said   For four weeks  I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard  and I'm earning more than the footballers  wow.  And where was he earning it from  From a little club in India. Could you have imagined that day would come  One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work. That's not bad  is it  So  at  .  billion dollars before the first ball was bowled. What India was doing  though  was benchmarking itself against the best in the world  and it became a huge brand. Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today. IPL became the biggest brand in India and  because our elections  had to be moved to South Africa  and we had to start the tournament in three weeks. Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks. But we did it. You know why  Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event  and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks. Our population  which for a long time we thought was a problem  suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching    the huge consuming class    everybody came to watch the cricket. We'd also made cricket the only sport in India  which is a pity  but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big  which is a bit of a tragedy of our times. Now  this last minute before I go    there's a couple of side effects of all this. For a long time  India was this country of poverty  dust  beggars  snake charmers  filth  Delhi belly    people heard Delhi belly stories before they came. And  all of a sudden  India was this land of opportunity. Cricketers all over the world said   You know  we love India. We love to play in India.  And that felt good  you know  We said   The dollar's quite powerful actually.  Can you imagine  you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore. There's no filth  there's no beggars  all the snake charmers have vanished  everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules. Right so  finally  an English game that India usurped a little bit  but T   is going to be the next missionary in the world. If you want to take the game around the world  it's got to be the shortest form of the game. You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through    days with no result in the end  or you can't take it all over the world. So that's what T   is doing. Hopefully  it'll make everyone richer  hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business. Thank you very much. Thank you. If I can leave you with one big idea today  it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts  and instead of thinking about information overload  what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible. So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age. This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. It's called Pivot  and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths    say  accidents. And  right away  I see there's a different pattern that emerges. This is because  in the mid area here  people are at their most active  and over here they're at their most frail. We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death  seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects  but not for everyone. If we go ahead and we filter by age    say    years or less    we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about. And if you drill into that  it's especially the case for men. So you get the idea that viewing information  viewing data in this way  is a lot like swimming in a living information info graphic. And if we can do this for raw data  why not do it for content as well  So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced. It's all here  it's all on the web. You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. With Pivot  you can drill into a decade. You can drill into a particular year. You can jump right into a specific issue. So I'm looking at this  I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue  the sports. I'm a Lance Armstrong fan  so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that  which reveals  for me  all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of. Now  if I want to just kind of take a peek at these  I might think   Well  what about taking a look at all of cycling   So I can step back  and expand on that. And I see Greg LeMond now. And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way    going narrower  broader  backing in  backing out    you're not searching  you're not browsing. You're doing something that's actually a little bit different. It's in between  and we think it changes the way information can be used. So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy. What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary. So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from. I'm only showing the top     most popular Wikipedia pages right here. But even in this limited view  we can do a lot of things. Right away  we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia. I'm going to go ahead and select government. Now  having selected government  I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year. So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page. It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them. Looking at one of these particular summaries  I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year  bringing up all of them. So looking at these people  I can see that the majority come from government  some have come from natural sciences  some  fewer still  have come from business    there's my boss    and one has come from music. And interestingly enough  Bono is also a TED Prize winner. So we can go  jump  and take a look at all the TED Prize winners. So you see  we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web  not from page to page  but at a higher level of abstraction. And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise. I'm just showing the New York Times website here. So Pivot  this application    I don't want to call it a browser  it's really not a browser  but you can view web pages with it    and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this. So I can step back  pop right back into a specific section. Now the reason why this is important is because  by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way  I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way. So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frames. Here  in fact  is the state of all the demo that I just gave. And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today. And  if I want to step back and look at everything  I can slice and dice my history  perhaps by my search history    here  I was doing some nepotistic searching  looking for Bing  over here for Live Labs Pivot. And from these  I can drill into the web page and just launch them again. It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times  and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data. So right now  in this world  we think about data as being this curse. We talk about the curse of information overload. We talk about drowning in data. What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down  so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next  we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things  and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden  If we can do that  then instead of being trapped in data  we might actually extract information. And  instead of dealing just with information  we can tease out knowledge. And if we get the knowledge  then maybe even there's wisdom to be found. So with that  I thank you. I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. In high school  I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. And I was always absorbed in a book  science fiction book  which took my mind to other worlds  and satisfied  in a narrative form  this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. And you know  that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the woods  hiking and taking  samples     frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water    and bringing it back  looking at it under the microscope. You know  I was a real science geek. But it was all about trying to understand the world  understand the limits of possibility. And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me  because what was happening  this was in the late '  s  we were going to the moon  we were exploring the deep oceans. Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined. So  that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape  I had to create these images in my head. You know  we all did  as kids having to read a book  and through the author's description  put something on the movie screen in our heads. And so  my response to this was to paint  to draw alien creatures  alien worlds  robots  spaceships  all that stuff. I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook. That was    the creativity had to find its outlet somehow. And an interesting thing happened  The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth. I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday    that seemed pretty darn unlikely. But that was a world I could really go to  right here on Earth  that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books. So  I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of   . And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada      miles from the nearest ocean. But I didn't let that daunt me. I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo  New York  right across the border from where we live. And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo  New York. And I didn't see the ocean  a real ocean  for another two years  until we moved to California. Since then  in the intervening    years  I've spent about       hours underwater  and     hours of that was in submersibles. And I've learned that that deep ocean environment  and even the shallow oceans  are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination. Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. I still  to this day  stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives. And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing  and just as strong as it ever was. But when I chose a career as an adult  it was filmmaking. And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images. And I was  as a kid  constantly drawing comic books  and so on. So  filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together  and that made sense. And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories   Terminator    Aliens  and  The Abyss.  And with  The Abyss   I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. So  you know  merging the two passions. Something interesting came out of  The Abyss   which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film  which was to create this kind of liquid water creature  we actually embraced computer generated animation  CG. And this resulted in the first soft surface character  CG animation that was ever in a movie. And even though the film didn't make any money    barely broke even  I should say    I witnessed something amazing  which is that the audience  the global audience  was mesmerized by this apparent magic. You know  it's Arthur Clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. They were seeing something magical. And so that got me very excited. And I thought   Wow  this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art.  So  with  Terminator     which was my next film  we took that much farther. Working with ILM  we created the liquid metal dude in that film. The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work. And it did  and we created magic again  and we had the same result with an audience    although we did make a little more money on that one. So  drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to   This is going to be a whole new world   this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists. So  I started a company with Stan Winston  my good friend Stan Winston  who is the premier make up and creature designer at that time  and it was called Digital Domain. And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on  and we would go right to digital production. And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '  s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do. So  I wrote this piece called  Avatar   which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects  of CG effects  beyond  with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG  and the main characters would all be in CG  and the world would be in CG. And the envelope pushed back  and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. So  I shelved it  and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. You know  I went and pitched it to the studio as  'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship   It's going to be this epic romance  passionate film.  Secretly  what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of  Titanic.  And that's why I made the movie. And that's the truth. Now  the studio didn't know that. But I convinced them. I said   We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real. We'll be using it in the opening of the film. It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook.  And I talked them into funding an expedition. Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality. Because we actually created a reality where six months later  I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic  looking at the real Titanic through a view port. Not a movie  not HD    for real. Now  that blew my mind. And it took a lot of preparation  we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. But  it struck me how much this dive  these deep dives  was like a space mission. You know  where it was highly technical  and it required enormous planning. You get in this capsule  you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself. And I thought like   Wow. I'm like  living in a science fiction movie. This is really cool.  And so  I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration. Of course  the curiosity  the science component of it    it was everything. It was adventure  it was curiosity  it was imagination. And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me. Because  you know  I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window. As we did some of our subsequent expeditions  I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before  sometimes things that no one had seen before  that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them. So  I was completely smitten by this  and had to do more. And so  I actually made a kind of curious decision. After the success of  Titanic   I said   OK  I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker  and I'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while.  And so  we started planning these expeditions. And we wound up going to the Bismark  and exploring it with robotic vehicles. We went back to the Titanic wreck. We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic. And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship  which had never been done. Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it  so we created technology to do it. So  you know  here I am now  on the deck of Titanic  sitting in a submersible  and looking out at planks that look much like this  where I knew that the band had played. And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. When I say   I'm operating it   but my mind is in the vehicle. I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic. And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had  because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it  because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie. And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship. So  it was this absolutely remarkable experience. And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience    that you actually can have these robotic avatars  then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle  into this other form of existence. It was really  really quite profound. And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post human futures that I can imagine  as a science fiction fan. So  having done these expeditions  and really beginning to appreciate what was down there  such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing  amazing animals    they're basically aliens right here on Earth. They live in an environment of chemosynthesis. They don't survive on sunlight based system the way we do. And so  you're seeing animals that are living next to a     degree Centigrade water plumes. You think they can't possibly exist. At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well    again  it's the science fiction influence  as a kid. And I wound up getting involved with the space community  really involved with NASA  sitting on the NASA advisory board  planning actual space missions  going to Russia  going through the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols  and all these sorts of things  to actually go and fly to the international space station with our  D camera systems. And this was fascinating. But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. And taking them down so that they had access    astrobiologists  planetary scientists  people who were interested in these extreme environments    taking them down to the vents  and letting them see  and take samples and test instruments  and so on. So  here we were making documentary films  but actually doing science  and actually doing space science. I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan  you know  as a kid  and doing this stuff for real. And you know  along the way in this journey of discovery  I learned a lot. I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership. Now you think director has got to be a leader  leader of  captain of the ship  and all that sort of thing. I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions. Because I had to  at a certain point  say   What am I doing out here  Why am I doing this  What do I get out of it   We don't make money at these damn shows. We barely break even. There is no fame in it. People sort of think I went away between  Titanic  and  Avatar  and was buffing my nails someplace  sitting at the beach. Made all these films  made all these documentary films for a very limited audience. No fame  no glory  no money. What are you doing  You're doing it for the task itself  for the challenge    and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is    for the thrill of discovery  and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team. Because we would do these things with        people  working for years at a time  sometimes at sea for two  three months at a time. And in that bond  you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you  that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else. When you come back to the shore and you say   We had to do this  and the fiber optic  and the attentuation  and the this and the that  all the technology of it  and the difficulty  the human performance aspects of working at sea   you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cops have  or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it. Creates a bond  creates a bond of respect. So  when I came back to make my next movie  which was  Avatar   I tried to apply that same principle of leadership  which is that you respect your team  and you earn their respect in return. And it really changed the dynamic. So  here I was again with a small team  in uncharted territory  doing  Avatar   coming up with new technology that didn't exist before. Tremendously exciting. Tremendously challenging. And we became a family  over a four and half year period. And it completely changed how I do movies. So  people have commented on how   Well  you know  you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora.  To me  it was more of a fundamental way of doing business  the process itself  that changed as a result of that. So  what can we synthesize out of all this  You know  what are the lessons learned  Well  I think number one is curiosity. It's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world. I have young filmmakers come up to me and say   Give me some advice for doing this.  And I say   Don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you    don't do it to yourself  don't bet against yourself  and take risks.  NASA has this phrase that they like   Failure is not an option.  But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration  because it's a leap of faith. And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. So  that's the thought I would leave you with  is that in whatever you're doing  failure is an option  but fear is not. Thank you. I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer  I'm not a choreographer    I'm actually a filmmaker  a storyteller. I directed a movie two years ago called  Step Up    The Streets.  Anybody  Anybody  Yeah  During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip hop dancers    amazing  the best in the world    and they brought me into a society  the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind. I mean  this is literally human beings with super human strength and abilities. They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back. They could spin on their heads for    times in a row. I'd never seen anything like that. When I was growing up  my heroes were people like Fred Astaire  Gene Kelly  Michael Jackson. I grew up in a musical family. And those guys  those were like  ultimate heroes. Being a shy  little  skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self esteem  those guys made me believe in something bigger. Those guys made me want to  like   I'm going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl.  And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared  sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos. But after seeing what I've seen  the truth is  they have not disappeared at all. They're here  getting better and better every day. And dance has progressed. It is insane what dance is right now. Dance has never had a better friend than technology. Online videos and social networking ... dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance  where kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video created in Detroit  building on it within days and releasing a new video  while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself. And this is happening every day. And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages  with cheap webcams  lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow. Our Fred Astaires  our Gene Kellys our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips  and may not have that opportunity  except for us. So  we created the LXD  sort of a    the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers  a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world. A living  breathing comic book series  but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man  these guys can actually do it. And we're going to show you some today. So  let me introduce to you  some of our heroes right now. We got Madd Chadd  Lil' C  Kid David and J Smooth. Please be excited  have fun  yell  scream. Ladies and gentlemen  The LXD. I get a lot of different reactions actually. Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it  but sometimes they get a little freaked out. And  I don't know  I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit. J Smooth  When I'm in the zone    I'm dancing and free styling it    I actually visually kind of picture lines  and moving them. I think of like  Transformers  like how panels open and then they fold  they fold in  and then you close that panel. And then another thing opens  you close that. Kid David  It's kind of like  honestly a lot of times I don't really know what's going on when I'm dancing. Because at that point it's just really like  it's my body and the music. It's not really a conscious decision   I'm going to do this next  I'm going to do this.  It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore  and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music. I got my name just because I was so young. I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with. So  it was always like  they called me Kid David  because I was the kid. L'il C  I tell them to create a ball  and then you just use that ball of energy. And instead of throwing it out  people would think that's a krump move  that's a krump move. That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out  you throw it out  and you hold it. And you let it go  and then right when you see the tail  you grab it by the tail  then you bring it back in. And you just got this piece of energy and you just  you're manipulating it. You know  you create power  then you tame it. I have a vision for each one of you  and the vision I have for you is that when you wake up in the morning  your blood is singing at the thought of being who you are and doing what you do  that as you go through the day  you can literally sink to your knees in gratitude at the tremendous good fortune that's been bestowed on you  that as you go through the day  you become radiantly alive several times. And if your life isn't like that  I'd like to humbly suggest that you're wasting your life. A life is too short to be wasted. So what I propose to do in the next    minutes    I've used up one minute already    is to give you a set of powerful tools which can get you started on being there. Is that of interest to you  Audience  Yes. Srikumar Rao  OK. This is a conference on happiness  but even if it wasn't a conference on happiness  would it be right if I said that in some way  shape  fashion or form  you're devoting your entire life to being happy  Everything you do    your job  family  children  relationships  whatever    is a quest for happiness. Correct  I'd like you to think about the following  What do you have to get in order to be happy  We're just going to spend a minute on this. What do you have to get in order to be happy  Anybody  quick  When I conduct this experiment  a bunch of stuff comes up  vast wealth  trophy spouse  good health  lots of travel  time  etc  etc  etc. Right now  if you were to think about it  you probably have a list of   Here's what I need to get in order to be happy.  I would like you to consider this  anything that you can get    let me repeat that    anything you can get  you can un get. Is that correct  So  vast wealth can make you happy. Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow. A number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already. So whatever you get that can make you happy can go away. Where does that leave you  Not a very nice place  right  I have a different proposition to suggest to you. What I have to suggest to you is that there is nothing that you have to get  do or be in order to be happy. Let me repeat that  there is nothing that you have to get  do or be in order to be happy. In fact  happiness is your innate nature. It is hardwired into you. It is part of your DNA. You cannot not be happy. Now  all of you are very polite  and in some of the other forums I speak in  such as top business schools  they're not so polite. And invariably  somebody articulates what many of you are thinking  which is   If happiness is my innate nature  how come I am not experiencing it  How come I am experiencing my life sucks   And the answer to that is actually very simple. You have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. Let me repeat that  you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. And the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model. A mental model is a notion we have that this is the way the world works. All of us have mental models  we've got dozens of mental models. We've got mental models on how to find a job  how to get ahead at work  how to pick a restaurant to eat at  how to have a movie to go to ... dozens of them. The problem isn't that we have mental models. The problem is that we don't know that we have mental models. We think this is the way the world works. And the more we invest in a mental model  the more it appears that this  in fact  is the way the world works. But it isn't  it's just a mental model  and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something so we can be something. Like  we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places so we can be happy. We have to be in a relationship so we can have great sex so we can be happy. All of this is a variation of the if then model. And the if then model is  if this happens  then we will be happy. If I were to get a better job  if I were to get more money  if my boss would have a heart attack  if only I was married  if only my wife would leave me    if only I had children  if my children would grow up and go to college ... It doesn't matter what it is. The whole notion is if this happens  then I will be happy. And right now  the only thing that's different between the persons in this audience is what is the particular  if  that you are focusing on  And the only thing that's different between you now and where you were    years ago is what is the particular  if  that you were focusing on  Think about your life    years ago. Spend a minute doing that. Ten years ago  if you remember clearly  there were certain things you wanted. Is that correct  Odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted    years ago you now have. Is that correct  Where has that left you  In exactly the same place  right  What we don't realize is the model itself is flawed. The if then model     If this happens I will be happy     the model itself is flawed. But instead of recognizing that it is the model itself that's flawed  what we do is spend enormous amounts of time changing the  if.   Oh  well  I thought if I became CEO it would help  but now I realize it's not that I want to become a CEO. I want to become the billionaire CEO  and then I will be happy.  You've got your own variation on that. But it's the model itself that's flawed  not what you put on the  if  side of the equation. I can demonstrate that to you. Can any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity  Maybe a rainbow  a mountain range  a valley  the sea. And if you remember that    raise your hands if you could. Virtually all of you could  right  Have you ever wondered why that happened  The reason that happened is that somehow  for some reason  at that instant  you accepted the universe exactly as it was. You didn't say   That's a beautiful rainbow  but it's kind of off to the left  and if I could move it     yards to the right  it would be ever so much more beautiful.  You didn't say   That's a beautiful valley  but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches. So if you gave me a chainsaw and    minutes  I'd make it ever so much better.  Oh no  the rainbow off center was just fine. The tree with its crooked branches was just fine. And the moment you accepted the universe just as it was  your habitual wanting self dropped away  and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced  and you felt it. And I know you felt it because now  even now after all those years  you can still remember it. The problem is that your life right now  with all of the problems that you have    more precisely  all of the problems that you think you have    is equally perfect. But you do not accept it. In fact  you're spending all your time striving with might and main to make it different. You are not accepting it. And when you're not accepting it  you're buying into the if then model  if this happens  then I will be happy. And it's the model itself that is flawed. So let me show you how you can get out of that  or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that. I'd like to share with you that action. We all live our lives because we want to achieve something  correct  You know  we are here and we want to have something. Alex wants to have a successful conference. You know  many of you want to have great programs for your companies that are very successful. You want to progress  have more money  all of that  is that correct  Each of those is an outcome  you would like something to happen. Now  I'd like you to think about the following  actions are within your control  not entirely  but to a large extent. The outcome is completely out of your control. OK  Actions are within your control. The outcome is completely outside your control. Have any of you recognized that when you have a goal and you start to work towards it  some of the time you don't achieve your goal  and some of the time what you get is the exact opposite of what you wanted  Has that happened to any of you  Like there was a friend of mine who said   Gee  you know  I have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife  and this has to change.  So the next time we went on a business trip  he bought a very expensive dress for her. And this was his way of showing  you know  I care for you  and nice things would happen. And when he presented the gift to his wife  her immediate reaction was   After    years of marriage  you don't know my size    And furthermore  don't you know I never wear this kind of thing   And the next thing you know  he had a full blown marital spat. Has that happened to any of you  You've taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted  Happens all the time. Well  we live in a world where what we think of  what we invest in  is the outcome. We define our life in the following way  here I am  here is where I want to go  these are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am to where I want to go  and if I succeed  life is wonderful. And if I don't  then I have failed  life is no good  life sucks. True  False  That is how we live. We invest in the outcome  and as I've just pointed out  the outcome is frequently different from what we would like  and sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like. You invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of frustration  angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck. There is an alternative. And the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome  you invest in the process. And the best way to describe that is a quote by John Wooden. I don't know how many of you are familiar with John Wooden. He's very well known in the United States and certainly among basketball fans. He's the only person ever to make the basketball Hall of Fame both as a player and as a coach. And what he told his entering team    he led UCLA to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the NCAA    and what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning. He always said   When it's over and you look in the mirror  did you do the best that you were capable of  And if you did the best that you were capable of  the score doesn't matter. But I would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of  you will find the score to your liking.  That is investing in a process. What we do is the exact opposite. We invest in the outcome. This is what I want    oh  I want it so desperately  because if I get it I will be happy. And you try with might and main  to do whatever you can  but you are always focusing on   This is the outcome.  Now  focusing on the outcome is fine. It gives you direction. Investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well being. And that is a surefire recipe for failure. What you can do is something else. You can invest in the process. That is  once you have determined  here is where I am  here is where I want to be  and that's fine  you focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction  and then you invest yourself completely in the process. You say  here are the steps you want to take  and you put everything into it. And if you succeed  wonderful. And if you don't succeed  still wonderful  because now you have a new starting point  and from that new starting point  you select another outcome and keep going. And when you do that  you will find that every day is a blast. Let me give you an example. And if you have children    raise your hands if you have children. Have you ever seen a small child learn to walk  What happens  and this happens typically between    and    months  is the child gets up and she sees everybody walking  she wants to walk  she gets up  she falls down  she starts crying and momma runs up and comforts her  kisses the place  makes it well. She tries again  falls down  mommy runs up again. After some time  mommy feels tired and no longer runs up and the child stops crying  and then she gets up  takes a step and doesn't fall down  and then she takes another  and a beautiful smile comes on her face. And very soon  generally within    hours  she's walking all over the place  upsetting your living room arrangements. And you know you've gone to a new stage of parenting. Right  Now  imagine what would happen if each time the child fell  she would say   Oh my God  I failed again. I'm never going to learn to walk.  And you have to get counseling for her to help her deal with feelings of inadequacy and not being able to achieve and fail yet again. How long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that  if every three times she fell down  you had to get a counselor to counsel her and so on  Sounds funny  doesn't it  But that is exactly what we're doing. What the child is doing is focusing on the process. She's investing in the process  not in the outcome. What we do is the exact opposite. As we grow up  we lose the ability to invest in the process  we start investing in the outcome. By definition the outcome is outside of our control  and if that's where we spend all of our emotional energy  we are going to get drained as we do. But if  on the other hand  we said   Here is the outcome  I am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit I could   every day is a blast  and you're well on your way to achieving the vision that I outlined to you. The question that I get all the time  is people say   Professor Rao  but nothing makes me passionate.  So I say   OK  what would   And they invariably come up with  you know  here is a list of things. Here's my job and here's how much it pays  this is the kind of person my boss is  the kind of people my colleagues are  and here's how my customers are  here's how much I travel  here's how big my office is  how deep the carpeting is  how many windows I have    a bunch of parameters. And what I tell them is what I want to share with you  because all of that stuff    first of all  it doesn't exist. But second  even if it did and you were plugged into it  it would not take more than six months for you to be the same sorry  miserable self there as you are now  because passion exists inside you. It does not exist in the job. And if you don't find a way to ignite it within you right where you are  you are not going to find it outside. But if you do find a way to ignite it where you are  then you will find that the external world rearranges itself to accommodate the new person that you are becoming. And as you do that  you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis. Persons come up whom you're delighted to meet. New people enter your life. It's just a breeze  because all you do in your life is you take journeys. You came here to this conference  you went on a journey. You hang around the water cooler  talking about how terrible your place of work is  you went on a journey. You watch  Desperate Housewives   you go on a journey. You go on a journey where    something women are having affairs with    something gardeners while the husbands are playing around with models. All you do is go on journeys. There's nothing wrong with that  but just ask yourself   Is this a journey I want to take  Does this take me to a place I want to spend time   And if you start doing that  you will find that your life changes. The kind of people you meet  the things you talk about  the movies you go to  the books you read    everything changes. And you begin all of that by focusing on the process. Invest in the process  not in the outcome. Thank you. Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data  to put your data on the web  on the basis that if people put data onto the web    government data  scientific data  community data  whatever it is    it will be used by other people to do wonderful things  in ways that they never could have imagined. So  today I'm back just to show you a few things  to show you  in fact  there is an open data movement afoot  now  around the world. The cry of  Raw data now   which I made people make in the auditorium  was heard around the world. So  let's roll the video. A classic story  the first one which lots of people picked up  was when in March    on March   th in fact  soon after TED    Paul Clarke  in the U.K. government  blogged   Oh  I've just got some raw data. Here it is  it's about bicycle accidents.  Two days it took the Times Online to make a map  a mashable map    we call these things mash ups    a mashed up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected. Here's more data  traffic survey data  again  put out by the U.K. government  and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards  then a user could just make a map  just by clicking. Does this data affect things  Well  let's get back to     . Look at Zanesville  Ohio. Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant  and which houses are there  which houses have been connected to the water. And he got  from other data sources  information to show which houses are occupied by white people. Well  there was too much of a correlation  he felt  between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water  and the judge was not impressed either. The judge was not impressed to the tune of   .  million dollars. That's the power of taking one piece of data  another piece of data  putting it together  and showing the result. Let's look at some data from the U.K. now. This is U.K. government data  a completely independent site  Where Does My Money Go. It allows anybody to go there and burrow down. You can burrow down by a particular type of spending  or you can go through all the different regions and compare them. So  that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data. Yes  certainly you can do it over here. Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California. Take an arbitrary example  Long Beach  California  you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy. In fact  this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov  and data.gov.uk. And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U.K. in blue  and the U.S. in red. How can you use this stuff  Well  for example  if you have lots of data about places you can take  from a postcode    which is like a zip plus four    for a specific group of houses  you can make paper  print off a paper which has got very  very specific things about the bus stops  the things specifically near you. On a larger scale  this is a mash up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections. It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at. The red circles are polling stations  selected by your criteria. And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors  like the threat level. So  that was government data. I also talked about community generated data    in fact I edited some. This is the wiki map  this is the Open Street Map.  Terrace Theater  I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year. I was not the only person editing the open street map. Each flash on this visualization    put together by ITO World    shows an edit in      made to the Open Street Map. Let's now spin the world during the same year. Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map  and realizing it could be better. You can see Europe is ablaze with updates. Some places  perhaps not as much as they should be. Here focusing in on Haiti. The map of Port au Prince at the end of      was not all it could be  not as good as the map of California. Fortunately  just after the earthquake  GeoEye  a commercial company  released satellite imagery with a license  which allowed the open source community to use it. This is January  in time lapse  of people editing ... that's the earthquake. After the earthquake  immediately  people all over the world  mappers who wanted to help  and could  looked at that imagery  built the map  quickly building it up. We're focusing now on Port au Prince. The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the  satellite images . So  now we have  immediately  a real time map showing where there are refugee camps    rapidly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port au Prince. Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device being used by rescue team in Haiti. There's the map showing  on the left hand side  that hospital    actually that's a hospital ship. This is a real time map that shows blocked roads  damaged buildings  refugee camps    it shows things that are needed  for rescue and relief work . So  if you've been involved in that at all  I just wanted to say  Whatever you've been doing  whether you've just been chanting   Raw data now   or you've been putting government or scientific data online  I just wanted to take this opportunity to say  Thank you very much  and we have only just started  I only have three minutes so I'm going to have to talk fast  and it will use up your spare mental cycles  so multitasking may be hard. So     years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking. I've had some time to think it over. And energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle    it's also about the road. Road design makes a difference  particularly intersections  of which there are two types  signalized and unsignalized  which means stop signs. Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections. Roundabouts are much better. A study of    intersections has found crashes drop    percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout. Injury crashes have dropped    percent  fatal crashes down    percent. But that's just safety. What about time and gas  So  traffic keeps flowing  so that means less braking  which means less accelerating  less gas and less pollution  less time wasted  and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency than we have in the United States. So  unsignalized intersections  meaning stop signs  they save many lives  but there's an excessive proliferation of them. Small roundabouts are starting to appear. This is one in my neighborhood. And they are much better    better than traffic lights  better than four way stop signs. They're expensive to install  but they are more expensive not to. So  we should look at that. But they are not applicable in all situations. So  take  for example  the three way intersection. So  it's logical that you'd have one there  on the minor road entering the major. But the other two are somewhat questionable. So  here's one. There's another one which I studied. Cars rarely appear on that third road. And so  the question is  what does that cost us  That intersection I looked at had about       cars per day in each direction  and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of. That's five cents each  and times       cars per day  that's         per year. That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution  wear on the car  and time. What's that time worth  Well  at    seconds per       cars  that's  .  hours per day. The average wage in the U.S. is     an hour. That is        per year. Add that together with the gas  and it's          per year  just for that sign in each direction. Discount that back to the present  at five percent  over two million dollars for a stop sign  in each direction. Now  if you look at what that adjacent property is worth  you could actually buy the property  cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line  and then sell it off again. And you'd still come out ahead. So  it makes one wonder   Why is it there   I mean  why is there that stop sign in each direction  Because it is saving lives. So  is there a better way to accomplish that goal  The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely. Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road. Can that be accomplished with existing signs  So  there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs. Stop signs were invented in       yield signs in     . But that's all we got. So  why not use a yield sign  Well the meaning of yield is  You must yield the right of way. That means that if there are five cars waiting  you have to wait till they all go  then you go. It lacks the notion of alternating  or taking turns  and it's always on the minor road  allowing the major one to have primacy. So  it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign. You couldn't suddenly tell everyone   OK  remember what you used to do at yield signs  Now do something different.  That would not work. So  what the world needs now is a new type of sign. So  you'd have a little instruction below it  you know  for those who didn't see the public service announcements. And it merges the stop sign and yield signs. It's kind of shaped like a T  as in taking turns. And uncertainty results in caution. When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down. So  now that you are all  Road Scholars  ... don't wait for that sign to be adopted  these things don't change quickly. But you all are members of communities  and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows. And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much. So  I've known a lot of fish in my life. I've loved only two. That first one  it was more like a passionate affair. It was a beautiful fish  flavorful  textured  meaty  a bestseller on the menu. What a fish. Even better  it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. So you could feel good about selling it. I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. One day  the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability.  Absolutely   I said. Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs  How do we keep fish on our menus  For the past    years  we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests. It's hard to overstate the destruction. Ninety percent of large fish  the ones we love    the tunas  the halibuts  the salmons  swordfish    they've collapsed. There's almost nothing left. So  for better or for worse  aquaculture  fish farming  is going to be a part of our future. A lot of arguments against it  Fish farms pollute    most of them do anyway    and they're inefficient. Take tuna  a major drawback. It's got a feed conversion ratio of    to one. That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. Not very sustainable. It doesn't taste very good either. So here  finally  was a company trying to do it right. I wanted to support them. The day before the event  I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don.  Don   I said   just to get the facts straight  you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea  you don't pollute.   That's right   he said.  We're so far out  the waste from our fish gets distributed  not concentrated.  And then he added   We're basically a world unto ourselves. That feed conversion ratio   .  to one   he said.  Best in the business.   .  to one  great.   .  what  What are you feeding    Sustainable proteins   he said.  Great   I said. Got off the phone. And that night  I was lying in bed  and I thought  What the hell is a sustainable protein  So the next day  just before the event  I called Don. I said   Don  what are some examples of sustainable proteins   He said he didn't know. He would ask around. Well  I got on the phone with a few people in the company  no one could give me a straight answer until finally  I got on the phone with the head biologist. Let's call him Don too.  Don   I said   what are some examples of sustainable proteins   Well  he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals  and then he said chicken pellets. I said   Chicken pellets   He said   Yeah  feathers  skin  bone meal  scraps  dried and processed into feed.  I said   What percentage of your feed is chicken   Thinking  you know  two percent.  Well  it's about    percent   he said. I said   Don  what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish   There was a long pause on the line  and he said   There's just too much chicken in the world.  I fell out of love with this fish. No  not because I'm some self righteous  goody two shoes foodie. I actually am. No  I actually fell out of love with this fish because  I swear to God  after that conversation  the fish tasted like chicken. This second fish  it's a different kind of love story. It's the romantic kind  the kind where the more you get to know your fish  you love the fish. I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. She kind of set us up. It came to the table a bright  almost shimmering  white color. The chef had overcooked it. Like twice over. Amazingly  it was still delicious. Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked  I can't  but this guy can. Let's call him Miguel    actually his name is Miguel. And no  he didn't cook the fish  and he's not a chef  at least in the way that you and I understand it. He's a biologist at Veta La Palma. It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river. Until the     s  the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. They did it by draining the land. They built this intricate series of canals  and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. Well  they couldn't make it work  not economically. And ecologically  it was a disaster. It killed like    percent of the birds  which  for this place  is a lot of birds. And so in       a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. What did they do  They reversed the flow of water. They literally flipped the switch. Instead of pushing water out  they used the channels to pull water back in. They flooded the canals. They created a        acre fish farm    bass  mullet  shrimp  eel    and in the process  Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction. The farm's incredible. I mean  you've never seen anything like this. You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away  and all you see are flooded canals and this thick  rich marshland. I was there not long ago with Miguel. He's an amazing guy  like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. Okay  There we are slogging through the wetlands  and I'm panting and sweating  got mud up to my knees  and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture. Here  he's pointing out a rare Black shouldered Kite. Now  he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. And here  here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. It turns out  Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. I asked him how he became such an expert on fish. He said   Fish  I didn't know anything about fish. I'm an expert in relationships.  And then he's off  launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants. And don't get me wrong  that was really fascinating  you know  the biotic community unplugged  kind of thing. It's great  but I was in love. And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. So I interrupted him. I said   Miguel  what makes your fish taste so good   He pointed at the algae.  I know  dude  the algae  the phytoplankton  the relationships  It's amazing. But what are your fish eating  What's the feed conversion ratio   Well  he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild. The plant biomass  the phytoplankton  the zooplankton  it's what feeds the fish. The system is so healthy  it's totally self renewing. There is no feed. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals  Later that day  I was driving around this property with Miguel  and I asked him  I said   For a place that seems so natural  unlike like any farm I'd ever been at  how do you measure success   At that moment  it was as if a film director called for a set change. And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight  thousands and thousands of pink flamingos  a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.  That's success   he said.  Look at their bellies  pink. They're feasting.  Feasting  I was totally confused. I said   Miguel  aren't they feasting on your fish    Yes   he said.  We lose    percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. Well  last year  this property had         birds on it  more than     different species. It's become  today  the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe.  I said   Miguel  isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm   He shook his head  no. He said   We farm extensively  not intensively. This is an ecological network. The flamingos eat the shrimp. The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pinker the belly  the better the system.  Okay  so let's review  a farm that doesn't feed its animals  and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators. A fish farm  but also a bird sanctuary. Oh  and by the way  those flamingos  they shouldn't even be there in the first place. They brood in a town     miles away  where the soil conditions are better for building nests. Every morning  they fly     miles into the farm. And every evening  they fly     miles back. They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A  . No kidding. I was imagining a  March of the Penguins  thing  so I looked at Miguel. I said   Miguel  do they fly     miles to the farm  and then do they fly     miles back at night  Do they do that for the children   He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. He said   No  they do it because the food's better.  I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish  which was delicious    and I don't like fish skin  I don't like it seared  I don't like it crispy. It's that acrid  tar like flavor. I almost never cook with it. Yet  when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain  it tasted not at all like fish skin. It tasted sweet and clean  like you were taking a bite of the ocean. I mentioned that to Miguel  and he nodded. He said   The skin acts like a sponge. It's the last defense before anything enters the body. It evolved to soak up impurities.  And then he added   But our water has no impurities.  OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish  a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators. And then I realized when he says   A farm that has no impurities   he made a big understatement  because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River. It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days  chemical contaminants  pesticide runoff. And when it works its way through the system and leaves  the water is cleaner than when it entered. The system is so healthy  it purifies the water. So  not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals  not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators  but a farm that's literally a water purification plant    and not just for those fish  but for you and me as well. Because when that water leaves  it dumps out into the Atlantic. A drop in the ocean  I know  but I'll take it  and so should you  because this love story  however romantic  is also instructive. You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food  whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle. What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture  one in which the food actually tastes good. But for a lot people  that's a bit too radical. We're not realists  us foodies  we're lovers. We love farmers' markets  we love small family farms  we talk about local food  we eat organic. And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food  someone  somewhere stands up and says   Hey guy  I love pink flamingos  but how are you going to feed the world   How are you going to feed the world  Can I be honest  I don't love that question. No  not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. One billion people will go hungry today. One billion    that's more than ever before    because of gross inequalities in distribution  not tonnage. Now  I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last    years. Feed grain to herbivores  pesticides to monocultures  chemicals to soil  chicken to fish  and all along agribusiness has simply asked   If we're feeding more people more cheaply  how terrible could that be   That's been the motivation  it's been the justification  it's been the business plan of American agriculture. We should call it what it is  a business in liquidation  a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible. That's not a business  and it isn't agriculture. Our breadbasket is threatened today  not because of diminishing supply  but because of diminishing resources. Not by the latest combine and tractor invention  but by fertile land  not by pumps  but by fresh water  not by chainsaws  but by forests  and not by fishing boats and nets  but by fish in the sea. Want to feed the world  Let's start by asking  How are we going to feed ourselves  Or better  How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself  To do that  don't look at the agribusiness model for the future. It's really old  and it's tired. It's high on capital  chemistry and machines  and it's never produced anything really good to eat. Instead  let's look to the ecological model. That's the one that relies on two billion years of on the job experience. Look to Miguel  farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves  farms that restore instead of deplete  farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively  farmers that are not just producers  but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor  too. And if I'm going to be really honest  they're a better chef than I'll ever be. You know  I'm okay with that  because if that's the future of good food  it's going to be delicious. Thank you. For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect  which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in  unless you think of it in the terms that I do  which is   Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real.  In other words  sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies  the placebo effect  just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a    for pain management  for example  if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect. Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it. In order for us to understand each other  I want to start by showing you a rudimentary  very simple magic trick. And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the     s. I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the     s. I'll do it for you  and then I'll explain it. And then I'll explain why I explained it. So  here's what happens. The knife  which you can examine  my hand  which you could examine. I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this. I'll get my sleeve back. And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here. That way you can see that at no time can anything travel  as long as I'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve. And the object of this is quite simple. I'm going to open my hand  and hopefully  if all is well  my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. In fact it's held so tightly in place that I can shake it  and the knife does not come off. Nothing goes up or down my sleeve  no trickery. And you can examine everything. Ta da  So  this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic  because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very    even though it's a very simple trick methodologically. Probably many of you in the room know this trick. What happens is this. I hold the knife in my hand. I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve  that is a lie. The reason I'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion. In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you  this finger right here  my index finger is just going to shift from where it is  to a position pointing out like this. Nice one. Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. So  it goes like this  from here  right. And as I move around my finger shifts. And we could talk about why this is deceptive  why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here  because the mind  and the way it processes information  it doesn't count  one  two  three. It groups them. But that's not really what this is about. Right  And then I open my hand up. Obviously it's clinging there  not by animal magnetism  but by chicanery  my index finger being there. And then when I close my finger  same thing  as I move back  this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger. I take this hand away. You give the knife out. There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks. Now   Laughter  what does that have to do with the placebo effect  I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open. I'm not a doctor or a researcher  so this  to me  was an astonishing thing. It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill  that's like aspirin shaped    it's just a round white pill    it has some certain measurable effect. But if you change the form that you give the placebo in  like you make a smaller pill  and color it blue  and stamp a letter into it  it is actually measurably more effective. Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical    they're sugar pills. But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill. What   Laughter  That really flipped me out. Turns out though  that that's not even where it stops. If you have capsules  they're more effective than tablets in any form. A colored capsule  that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. Dosage has something to do with this. One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills    I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry. But the point is ... And the form has something to do with it. And if you want the ultimate in placebo  you've go to the needle. Right  A syringe with some inert    a couple CCs of some inert something  and you inject this into a patient ... Well this is such a powerful image in their mind  it's so much stronger than the white pill. It's a really  this graph  well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slides. The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle. And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality  it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect. I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick. And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real. And we know from that study that when you want reality  you go to the needle. This is a seven inch hatpin. It's very  very sharp  and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit. This is really my flesh. This is not Damian's special grown flesh. That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect. I'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side. If you're queasy     Laughs  if you faint easily    I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night  and some people that I didn't know  and one woman almost passed out. So  I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next       in fact  you know what  I'll do the first bad part behind it. You'll get to see  you can look away too if you'd like to. So  here is what happens  right here  the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce. I'm sorry  man. Am I freaking you out  OK  and then just through my skin a tiny bit  and then out the other side like this. Now  essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick. Sort of. But you can't count my fingers right now can you  So  let me show them to you. That's one  two three  four  five. Yes  well... I know what people think when they see this. They go   Well  he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes. So  let me give you a little peek. How's that look out there  Pretty good. Yeah  I know.  Laughs  And the people in the back go   OK  I didn't really see that.  People in the satellite room are starting to move in now. Let me give you good close look at this. That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect. That's my flesh  and I can twist that around. I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy  look away  don't look at the thing. People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go   Well yeah  that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there  but if it were real he would be    see there's a hole there and a hole there  if it were real he would be bleeding. Well let me work up some blood for you. Yes  there it is. Normally now  I would take the needle out. I would clean off my arm  and I would show you that there are no wounds. But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real  I'm just going to leave it there  and walk off the stage. I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation. Now  usually when I mention suspended animation  people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh. But now  I'm not talking about gorking people out to fly to Mars or even Pandora  as much fun as that may be. I'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma. So what do I mean when I say  suspended animation   It is the process by which animals de animate  appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed. OK  so here is the sort of big idea  If you look out at nature  you find that as you tend to see suspended animation  you tend to see immortality. And so  what I'm going to tell you about is a way to tell a person who's in trauma    find a way to de animate them a bit so they're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack. An example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores. These creatures are some of the most immortal life forms on our planet  and they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation. Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive  but in suspended animation for as long as     million years. To suggest that this all  sort of  about little  tiny creatures  I want to bring it close to home. In the immortal germ line of human beings    that is  the eggs that sit in the ovaries    they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to    years in the life of each woman. So then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation. This is Sea Monkeys. Those of you with children  you know about them. You go to the pet store or the toy store  and you can buy these things. You just open the bag  and you just dump them into the plastic aquarium  and in about a week or so  you'll have little shrimps swimming around. Well  I wasn't so interested in the swimming. I was interested in what was going on in the bag  the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely. So these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird  little organisms. Occasionally  human beings are briefly de animated  and the stories of people who are briefly de animated that interest me the most are those having to do with the cold. Ten years ago  there was a skier in Norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall  and she was there for two hours before they extracted her. She was extremely cold  and she had no heartbeat    for all intents and purposes she was dead  frozen. Seven hours later  still without a heartbeat  they brought her back to life  and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her. A couple of years later    so I get really excited about these things    about a couple of years later  there was a    month old  she was from Canada. Her father had gone out in the wintertime  he was working night shift  and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper. And they found her hours later  frozen  lifeless  and they brought her back to life. There was a    year old woman in Duluth  Minnesota last year that was found frozen and without a pulse in her front yard one morning in the winter  and they brought her back to life. The next day  she was doing so well  they wanted to run tests on her. She got cranky and just went home. So  these are miracles  right  These are truly miraculous things that happen. Doctors have a saying that  in fact   You're not dead until you're warm and dead.  And it's true. It's true. In the New England Journal of Medicine  there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming  people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems. That's over    percent. So what I was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce  maybe  what happened to the skier. Well  I have to tell you something very odd  and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill. So  in this room  there's    percent oxygen or so  and if we reduce the oxygen concentration  we will all be dead. And  in fact  the animals we were working with in the lab    these little garden worms  nematodes    they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen. And here's the thing that should freak you out. And that is that  when we lower the oxygen concentration further by     times  to    parts per million  they were not dead  they were in suspended animation  and we could bring them back to life without any harm. And this precise oxygen concentration     parts per million  that caused suspended animation  is conserved. We can see it in a variety of different organisms. One of the creatures we see it in is a fish. And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out of suspended animation like you would a light switch. So this was pretty shocking to me  that we could do this. And so I was wondering  when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier  that we noticed that  of course  she had no oxygen consumption  and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation. But  of course  she was also extremely cold. So we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold. And so  what we found out was that  if you take animals that are animated like you and I  and you make them cold    that is  these were the garden worms    now they're dead. But if you have them in suspended animation  and move them into the cold  they're all alive. And there's the very important thing there  If you want to survive the cold  you ought to be suspended. Right  It's a really good thing. And so  we were thinking about that  about this relationship between these things  and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier. And so we wondered  Might there be some agent that is in us  something that we make ourselves  that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold  and might otherwise pass away  I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things. You know  I should mention briefly here that physiology textbooks that you can read about will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest. We have  from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath    that's when we're newborn to when we're dead    we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what's called a standard  or basal metabolic rate. But I knew that there were examples of creatures  also mammals  that do reduce their metabolic rate such as ground squirrels and bears  they reduce their metabolic rate in the wintertime when they hibernate. So I wondered  Might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us  And so  we went looking for such things. And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously. Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure. Well  we had a lot of them. We tried many different chemicals and agents  and we failed over and over again. So  one time  I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed  and I was watching a television show. It was a television show    it was a NOVA show on PBS    about caves in New Mexico. And this particular cave was Lechuguilla  and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans. The researchers had to suit up just to enter it. It's filled with this toxic gas  hydrogen sulfide. Now  hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us. We make it ourselves. The highest concentration is in our brains. Yet  it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I. It's an extraordinarily toxic thing. In fact  in chemical accidents  hydrogen sulfide is known to    if you breathe too much of it  you collapse to the ground  you appear dead  but if you were brought out into room air  you can be reanimated without harm  if they do that quickly. So  I thought   Wow  I have to get some of this.  Now  it's post      America  and when you go into the research institute  and you say   Hi. I'd like to buy some concentrated  compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because I have these ideas  see  about wanting to suspend people. It's really going to be OK.  So that's kind of a tough day  but I said   There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this.  As I said  this agent is in us  and  in fact  here's a curious thing  it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds  and where you burn it  and that you do this burning to live. And so we thought  like in a game of musical chairs  might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide  and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind  And because you can't bind the oxygen  maybe you wouldn't consume it  and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen. I mean  who knows  So     Laughter  So  there's the bit about the dopamine and being a little bit  what do you call it  delusional  and you might suggest that was it. And so  we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold  and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal. Now  mammals are warm blooded creatures  and when we get cold  we shake and we shiver  right  We try to keep our core temperature at    degrees by actually burning more oxygen. So  it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold. It stopped moving. It appeared dead. Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold. And here's the really important point. I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us. It's rapidly metabolized  and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de animation is simply put the thing out in room air  and it warms up  and it's none the worse for wear. Now  this was cosmic. Really. Because we had found a way to de animate a mammal  and it didn't hurt it. Now  we'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to rock bottom levels  and it was fine. Now  in this state of de animation  it could not go out dancing  but it was not dead  and it was not harmed. So we started to think  Is this the agent that might have been present in the skier  and might have she had more of it than someone else  and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died  as we found out with our worm experiments  So  we wondered  Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility  And one of the things we wondered    I'm sure some of you out there are economists  and you know all about supply and demand. And when supply is equal to demand  everything's fine  but when supply falls  in this case of oxygen  and demand stays high  you're dead. So  what I just told you is we can now reduce demand. We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal. And with money we got from DARPA  we could show just that. If you give mice hydrogen sulfide  you can lower their demand for oxygen  and you can put them into oxygen concentrations that are as low as       feet above the top of Mt. Everest  and they can sit there for hours  and there's no problem. Well this was really cool. We also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss  and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide. So these proof of concept experiments led me to say  I should found a company  and we should take this out to a wider playing field.  I founded a company called Ikaria with others' help. And this company  the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine  and the results are incredibly positive. In one model of heart attack  animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a    percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today. Same is true for organ failure  when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney  of liver  acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac bypass surgery. So  these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true  so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal low oxygen. And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low  incredibly low. In fact  so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit I just mentioned  which is a wonderful thing  if you're thinking about adopting this. You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them  it's really confusing. So  I want to say that we're in human trials. Now  and so    Thank you. The Phase   safety studies are over  and we're doing fine  we're now moved on. We have to get to Phase   and Phase  . It's going to take us a few years. This has all moved very quickly  and the mouse experiments of hibernating mice happened in       the first human studies were done in       and we should know in a couple of years whether it works or not. And this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people. I want to mention that  first of all  my wife  without whom this talk and my work would not be possible  so thank you very much. Also  the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff  the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle  Washington    wonderful place to work. And also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at Ikaria. One thing those people did out there was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide  which is this start up company that's burning venture capital very quickly  and they fused it with another company that sells another toxic gas that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide  and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly. And this gas that is delivered in over a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide  now is approved  on label  and saves thousands of babies a year from certain death. So it's really incredible for me to be a part of this. And I want to say that I think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way  and that in the not too distant future  an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide  or some related compound  to a person suffering severe injuries  and that person might de animate a bit  they might become a little more immortal. Their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home. And then  they will have the time  that will buy them the time  to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need. And then  after they get that care    like the mouse  like the skier  like the    year old woman    they'll wake up. A miracle  We hope not  or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common. Thank you very much. If you think about the phone    and Intel has tested a lot of the things I'm going to show you  over the last    years  in about     elderly households        in Ireland  and     in Portland    trying to understand  How do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way  And if you think about the phone  right  it's something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time. We're testing these kinds of simple sensor network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications. And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone  and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take  and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend. And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly  that sits on their kitchen table and says   I'm old. I'm frail.  It's surreptitious technology that's helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time. Now  we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones. Because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it. Think about it  all right  I'm going to answer the phone three different times.  Hello  Hey.  All right  That's the first time.  Hello  Uh  hey.   Hello  Uh  who  Oh  hey.  All right  Very big differences between the way I answered the phone the three times. And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time  down to the tenths of a microsecond  that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately  or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk  where they're like   Wait  who is this  Oh.  Right  Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today. We call these behavioral markers. There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone as quickly  when it rings  as they used to  Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem  Has their voice gotten more quiet  We're doing a lot of work with people with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's  where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients may be the best early indicator of Parkinson's five to    years before it shows up clinically. But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet. So  sensors are looking at that kind of voice. When you pick up the phone  how much tremor are you having  and what is that like  and what is that trend like over a period of time  Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to  Is it a dexterity problem  Is it the onset of arthritis  Are you using the phone  Are you socializing less than you used to  And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health mean  as a kind of a vital sign of the future  And then wow  what a radical idea  we    except in the United States    might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line. Wow  what a great day that will be once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things. So  these are what I would call behavioral markers. And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on for the last    years at Intel. How do you put simple disruptive technologies  and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk  Behavioral markers matter. How do we change behavior  How do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that's going to help us with prevention of disease  early onset of disease  and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time  Now  why would Intel let me spend a lot of time and money  over the last    years  trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers  This is some of the field work that we've done. We have now lived with       elderly households in    countries over the last    years. We study people in Rochester  New York. We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter  and their access to healthcare  and how much they socialize  is very different than in the summer. If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience. If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network  we fly and study them as well. So  we study the holistic health experience of       seniors over the last    years in    different countries. Why is Intel willing to fund that  It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about. Ten years ago  when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living  this is what I called it   Y K     .  You know  back in       we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers  and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from      to       that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to. It was right around New Years. And that switchover  when we had the larger number of older people on the planet  for the first time than younger people. For the first time in human history    and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic  that's the expectation from demographers  going forward. And    years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this. Right  Y K      was coming  the baby boomers starting to retire. Well folks  it's like we know these demographics here. This is a map of the entire world. It's like the lights are on  but nobody's home on this demographic Y K      problem. Right  I mean we sort of get it here  but we don't get it here  and we're not doing anything about it. The health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that's coming  and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care  but deliver care in some radically different ways. And in fact  it's upon us. I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security. That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement. She was born one second after midnight in     . A retired school teacher  there she is with a Social Security administrator. The first boomer actually  we didn't even wait till       next year. We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year. All right  so it's here. This Y K      problem is at our door. This is    tsunamis scheduled on the calendar  but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it. We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe  and react  as opposed to prepare for it. So  one of the reasons it's so challenging to prepare for this Y K problem is  I want to argue  we have what I would call mainframe poisoning. Andy Grove  about six or seven years ago  he doesn't even know or remember this  in a Fortune Magazine article he used the phrase  mainframe healthcare   and I've been extending and expanding this. He saw it written down somewhere. He's like   Eric that's a really cool concept.  I was like   Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article. I just extended it.  You know  this is the mainframe. This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large  expensive healthcare systems actually began in     . This is the first general hospital in Vienna. And actually the second general hospital in Vienna  in about       was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties. And it's a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body  and divided care into departments and compartments. And it was reflected in our architecture  it was reflected in the way that we taught students  and this mainframe mentality persists today. Now  I'm not anti hospital. With my own healthcare problems  I've taken drug therapies  I've traveled to this hospital and others  many  many times. But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right  And this is mainframe healthcare. And just as    years ago we couldn't conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts  that we're carrying around in our cell phone today  and suddenly  computing  that used to be an expert driven system  it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives    that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare. We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare. We are obsessed with this way of thinking. When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say   Quick response  healthcare.  The first word that comes up is  doctor.  The second that comes up is  hospital.  And the third is  illness  or  sickness.  Right  We are wired  in our imagination  to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place. Our entire health reform discussion right now  health I.T.  when we talk with policy makers  equals  How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe   We're not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home. And the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare. Right  This is a very reactive  crisis driven system. We're doing    minute exams with patients. It's population based. We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting  and we fix them up  like Humpty Dumpty all over again  and send them home  and hope    we might hand them a brochure  maybe an interactive website    that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe. And the problem is we can't afford it today  folks. We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured. And now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through  Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different. We've got to focus on the home. We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive  prevention driven  How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information    by    How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you  How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data  psychological data  relational data  in and on and around the home  And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that's around us to change our behavior  That's what we need to do for our personal health model. I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi from one of our studies    in her   s  had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls. Raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household  or any of your loved ones  your parents or so forth. Right  Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior. This is what was happening to Mimi  the family was worried about it  moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility. She tripped over her oxygen tank. Many people in this generation won't press the button  even if they have an alert call system  because they don't want to bother anybody  even though they've been paying    dollars a month. Boomers will press the button. Trust me. They're going to be pressing that button non stop. Right  Mimi broke her pelvis  lay all night  all morning  finally somebody came in and found her  sent her to the hospital. They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit. First night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility  moved her from one bed to another  kind of threw her  rebroke her pelvis  sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from  no one read the chart  put her on Tylenol  which she is allergic to  broke out  got bedsores  basically  had heart problems  and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there. Now  the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife's grandmother. Now  I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English  I work for Intel  I make a good salary  I'm smart about falls and fall related injuries    it's an area of research that I work on. I have access to senators and CEOs. I can't stop this from happening. What happens if you don't have money  you don't speak English or don't have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur  How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place  Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing to try to do exactly that. I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer. It's a research platform. It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three lead ECG. There is all kinds of sort of plug and play kind of Legos that you can do to capture  in the wild  in the real world  things like tremor  gait  stride length and those kinds of things. The problem is  our understanding of falls today  like Mimi  is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell  from the State  saying   What were you doing when you fell   That's sort of the state of the art. But with something like Shimmer  or we have something called the Magic Carpet  embedded sensors in carpet  or camera based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine  we're starting for the first time in those     elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand  What are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls  And most often we can do two interventions  fix the meds mix. I'm a qualitative researcher  but when I look at these data streams coming in from these homes  I can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on  because we see the changes in their patterns in the household. Right  These discoveries of behavioral markers  and behavioral changes are game changing  and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before. This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland of    actually what you're seeing is she's looking at data  in this picture  from the Magic Carpet. So  we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway  and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months. Here's what some of this data might look like. This is actually sensor firings. These are two different subjects in our study. It's about a year's worth of data. The color represents different rooms they are in the house. This person on the left is living in their own home. This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility. I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right  Now  this doesn't mean that much to you. But when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time    and we're looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house  to sort of micro motions that Shimmer picks up  about gait and stride length    these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we've never understood before. You can go to ORCATech.org    it has nothing to do with whales  it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology    to see more about that. The problem is  Intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research. I'm not bragging about how much we fund  it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging  chronic disease management and independent living in the home. So  my mantra here  my fourth slogan is         households or bust. We need to drive a national  if not international  Framingham type heart study of independent living technologies  where we have        elderly connected households with broadband  full medical characterization  and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from    household anecdotal studies that the universities fund  to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies. So         households or bust. These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies. My fifth and final phrase  I have tried for two years  and there were moments when we were quite close  to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something  from a mainframe model to a personal health model  or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we're going to finance. It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare. We're going to figure something out for the next    years  and try it. No matter who pays for it  we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways. The president needs to stand up and say  at the end of a healthcare reform debate   Our goal as a country is to move    percent of care out of institutions  clinics  hospitals and nursing homes  to the home  in    years.  It's achievable. We should do it economically  we should do it morally  and we should do it for quality of life. But there is no goal within this health reform. It's just a mess today. So  you know  that's my last message to you. How do we set a going to the moon goal of dealing with the Y K     problem that's coming  It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all  but it's going to be part of the solution. And if we don't create a personal health movement  something that we're all aiming towards in reform  then we're going to move nowhere. So  I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward. Thanks very much. I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer. I've been making games online now for    years  and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games. Now  I have a plan for this  and it entails convincing more people  including all of you  to spend more time playing bigger and better games. Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games. Some of you might be thinking   That's a lot of time to spend playing games. Maybe too much time  considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.  But actually  according to my research at the Institute for the Future  actually the opposite is true. Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems. In fact  I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet  we need to increase that total dramatically. I've calculated the total we need at    billion hours of game play every week. So  that's probably a bit of a counter intuitive idea  so I'll say it again  let it sink in  If we want to solve problems like hunger  poverty  climate change  global conflict  obesity  I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least    billion hours a week  by the end of the next decade. No. I'm serious. I am. Here's why. This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species. Truly. This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano. He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming  so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing. And this is a classic gaming emotion. Now  if you're not a gamer  you might miss some of the nuance in this photo. You probably see the sense of urgency  a little bit of fear  but intense concentration  deep  deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem. If you are a gamer  you will notice a few nuances here  the crinkle of the eyes up  and around the mouth is a sign of optimism  and the eyebrows up is surprise. This is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an  epic win.  Oh  you've heard of that. OK  good  so we have some gamers among us. An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive  you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it. It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination  and when you get there  you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of. That's an epic win. This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win. And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century    the face of someone who  against all odds  is on the verge of an epic win. Now  unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems. This is what I call the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is actually me making it. Can you see  Yes. Good. This is me making the  I'm Not Good At Life  face. This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley  California  where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life. And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have. We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games. I don't mean just good as in successful  although that's part of it. We do achieve more in game worlds. But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters    inspired to collaborate and to cooperate. And when we're in game worlds  I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves    the most likely to help at a moment's notice  the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes  to get up after failure and try again. And in real life  when we face failure  when we confront obstacles  we often don't feel that way. We feel overcome  we feel overwhelmed  we feel anxious  maybe depressed  frustrated or cynical. We never have those feelings when we're playing games  they just don't exist in games. So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student. What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything  How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work  So I looked at games like World of Warcraft  which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment. And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds. The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games  especially in World of Warcraft  there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world saving mission  right away. But not just any mission  it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game. Right  So you can do it. They never give you a challenge you can't achieve. But it is on the verge of what you're capable of  so you have to try hard. But there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft  no sitting around  wringing your hands    there's always something specific and important to be done. There are also tons of collaborators. Everywhere you go  hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission. That's not something we have in real life that easily  this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators. And there's this epic story  this inspiring story of why we're there  and what we're doing  and we get all this positive feedback. You guys have heard of leveling up     strength     intelligence. We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life. When I get off this stage  I'm not going to have    speaking  and    crazy idea      crazy idea. I don't get that feedback in real life. Now  the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time  we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds. It's just better than reality. So  so far  collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent  .   million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. Now  that's not necessarily a bad thing. It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in context   .   million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up. That was the first upright primate. So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games  the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution  which is an extraordinary thing. But it's also apt  because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games  we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings. We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. This is true. I believe this. So  consider this really interesting statistic  it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University  The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent        hours playing online games by the age of   . Now        hours is a really interesting number for two reasons. First of all  for children in the United States         hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school  from fifth grade to high school graduation  if you have perfect attendance. So  we have an entire parallel track of education going on  where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school. Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book  Outliers   so you would have heard of his theory of success  the         hours  theory of success. It's based on this great cognitive science research that says if we can master        hours of effortful study at anything by the age of     we will be virtuosos at it. We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world. And so  now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers. So  the big question is   What exactly are gamers getting so good at   Because if we could figure that out  we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games. These are our virtuoso gamers      million people who are extraordinarily good at something. And in the next decade  we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is. If you don't know it already  this is coming. The game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet  so that gamers all over the world  particularly in India  China  Brazil  can get online. They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. It will bring us up to  .  billion gamers. So I've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at. Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism. OK  think of this as extreme self motivation. Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle  combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible  and that it's always worth trying  and trying now. Gamers don't sit around. Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric. There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them  even if they've beaten us badly. And the reason is  it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. We trust that they will spend their time with us  that they will play by the same rules  value the same goal  stay with the game until it's over. And so  playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation. And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. Blissful productivity. I love it. You know  there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for    hours a week    kind of a half time job. It's because we know  when we're playing a game  that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing  or hanging out. We know that we are optimized as human beings  to do hard and meaningful work. And gamers are willing to work hard all the time  if they're given the right work. Finally  epic meaning. Gamers love to be attached to awe inspiring missions to human planetary scale stories. So  just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective  So  you all know Wikipedia  biggest wiki in the world. Second biggest wiki in the world  with nearly        articles  is the World of Warcraft wiki. Five million people use it every month. They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world. They are building an epic story. They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft. Okay  so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing  Gamers are super empowered hopeful individuals. These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world. And the only problem is  they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world. That's the problem that I'm trying to solve. There's an economist named Edward Castronova. His work is brilliant. He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds. And he says   We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments.  And he's an economist  so he's rational. And he says    Not like me  I'm a game designer  I'm exuberant. But he says that this makes perfect sense  because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life. They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life  they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life. So he says  for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world. Now  I also agree that that is rational  for now. But it is not  by any means  an optimal situation. We have to start making the real world work more like a game. I take my inspiration from something that happened       years ago. These are ancient dice  made out of sheep's knuckles. Before we had awesome game controllers  we had sheep's knuckles. And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings  and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus  you might know this history  which is the history of who invented games and why. Herodotus says that games  particularly dice games  were invented in the kingdom of Lydia  during a time of famine. Apparently  there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy. People were suffering. People were fighting. It was an extreme situation  they needed an extreme solution. So  according to Herodotus  they invented dice games  and they set up a kingdom wide policy  On one day  everybody would eat  and on the next day  everybody would play games. And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games  because games are so engaging  and immerse us in such satisfying  blissful productivity  they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat. And then on the next day  they would play games  and on the next day  they would eat. And according to Herodotus  they passed    years this way  surviving through a famine  by eating on one day  and playing games on the next. Now  this is exactly  I think  how we're using games today. We're using games to escape real world suffering    we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment  everything that's not satisfying about real life  and we're getting what we need from games. But it doesn't have to end there. This is really exciting. According to Herodotus  after    years the famine wasn't getting better  so the king decided they would play one final dice game. They divided the entire kingdom in half. They played one dice game  and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure. They would leave Lydia  and they would go out in search of a new place to live  leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available  and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive. Now  this sounds crazy  right  But recently  DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans  who then led to the Roman Empire  actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians. And so  recently  scientists have suggested that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true. And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly    years  that could have explained the famine. So this crazy story might be true. They might have actually saved their culture by playing games  escaping to games for    years  and then been so inspired  and knew so much about how to come together with games  that they actually saved the entire civilization that way. Okay  we can do that. We've been playing Warcraft since     . That was the first real time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series. That was    years ago. They played dice games for    years  we've been playing Warcraft for    years. I say we are ready for our own epic game. Now  they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world  so that's where I get my    billion hours a week of game play from. Let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games  until we solve real world problems. Now  I know you're asking   How are we going to solve real world problems in games   Well  that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years  at the Institute for the Future. We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto  and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future. We do not want to try to predict the future. What we want to do is make the future. We want to imagine the best case scenario outcome  and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality. We want to imagine epic wins  and then give people the means to achieve the epic win. I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. This is World Without Oil. We made this game in     . This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage. The oil shortage is fictional  but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real  and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game  you sign up  tell us where you live  and then we give you real time news videos  data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs  what's not available  how food supply is being affected  how transportation is being affected  if schools are closed  if there's rioting  and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it  to post videos  to post photos. We piloted this game with       players in       and we've tracked them for the three years since. And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience. Nobody wants to change how they live  just because it's good for the world  or because we're supposed to. But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them   We've run out of oil. This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on. Challenge yourself to see how you would survive   most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game. So for the next world saving game  we decided to aim higher    bigger problem than just peak oil. We did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future. And the premise was  a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only    years left on the planet. This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System  of course. We asked people to come online    almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies  you form a dream team    you've got the astronaut  the scientist  the ex convict  and they all have something to do to save the world. But in our game  instead of just having five people on the dream team  we said   Everybody's on the dream team  and it's your job to invent the future of energy  the future of food  the future of health  the future of security and the future of the social safety net.  We had       people play that game for eight weeks. They came up with     insanely creative solutions that you can go online  Google  Superstruct   and see. So  finally  the last game  we're launching it March  rd. This is a game done with the World Bank Institute. If you complete the game  you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Innovator  class of     . Working with universities all over sub Saharan Africa  and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills. We've got a graphic novel  we've got leveling up in skills like local insight  knowledge networking  sustainability  vision and resourcefulness. I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people  anywhere in the world  particularly in developing areas  who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world. So  I'm going to wrap up now. I want to ask a question. What do you think happens next  We've got all these amazing gamers  we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do  but none of them have saved the real world yet. Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real world work  that games are a powerful platform for change. We have all these amazing superpowers  blissful productivity  the ability to weave a tight social fabric  this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning. I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter  to survive on this planet for another century. That's my hope  that you will join me in making and playing games like this. When I look forward to the next decade  I know two things for sure  that we can make any future we can imagine  and we can play any games we want  so I say  Let the world changing games begin. Thank you. OK. We've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind. And what I'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation  how the will to survive can bring that out in people. This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest  it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest. And when it occurred  I was the only doctor on the mountain. So I'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive. OK  this is Mount Everest. It's        feet high. I've been there six times  Four times I did work with National Geographic  making tectonic plate measurements  twice  I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices. It was on my fourth trip to Everest that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake. And the Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen  and we should have listened to them. Everest is an extreme environment. There's only one third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level. Near the summit  temperatures can be    degrees below zero. You can have winds    to    miles an hour. It's actually a wind chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars. I remember one time being up near the summit  I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle  inside my down jacket  only to discover that the water was already frozen solid. That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit. OK  this is the route up Everest. It starts at base camp  at        feet. Camp One        feet higher. Camp Two  another       feet higher up  what's called the Western Cwm. CampThree is at the base of Lhotse  which is the fourth highest mountain in the world  but it's dwarfed by Everest. And then Camp Four is the highest camp  that's       feet short of the summit. This is a view of base camp. This is pitched on a glacier at        feet. It's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload. And this is what they unloaded for me  I had four yak loads of medical supplies  which are dumped in a tent  and here I am trying to arrange things. This was our expedition. It was a National Geographic expedition  but it was organized by The Explorers Club. There were three other expeditions on the mountain  an American team  a New Zealand team and an IMAX team. And  after actually two months of preparation  we built our camps all the way up the mountain. This is a view looking up the icefall  the first       feet of the climb up from base camp. And here's a picture in the icefall  it's a waterfall  but it's frozen  but it moves very slowly  and it actually changes every day. When you're in it  you're like a rat in a maze  you can't even see over the top. This is near the top of the icefall. You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen. That way  it's less likely to tumble down on you. These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun up. This is me crossing a crevasse. We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached. That's another crevasse. Some of these things are    stories deep or more  and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over  we would never do it. Okay. This is Camp One. It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall. And from there we climb up to Camp Two  which is sort of the foreground. These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face  that mountain toward Camp Three. They're on fixed ropes here. A fall here  if you weren't roped in  would be       feet down. This is a view taken from camp three. You can see the Lhotse face is in profile  it's about a    degree angle. It takes two days to climb it  so you put the camp halfway through. If you notice  the summit of Everest is black. There's no ice over it. And that's because Everest is so high  it's in the jet stream  and winds are constantly scouring the face  so no snow gets to accumulate. What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit. This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four  moving in  up through the clouds. And this is at Camp Four. Once you get to Camp Four  you have maybe    hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not. Everybody's on oxygen  your supplies are limited  and you either have to go up or go down  make that decision very quickly. This is a picture of Rob Hall. He was the leader of the New Zealand team. This is a radio he used later to call his wife that I'll tell you about. These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit. They're up at Camp Four  and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit. This is not good weather to climb in  so the climbers are just waiting  hoping that the wind's going to die down. And  in fact  the wind does die down at night. It becomes very calm  there's no wind at all. This looks like a good chance to go for the summit. So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the Triangular Face. It's the first part of climb. It's done in the dark  because it's actually less steep than what comes next  and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark. So that's what happened. The climbers got on the southeast ridge. This is the view looking at the southeast ridge. The summit would be in the foreground. From here  it's about       feet up at a    degree angle to the summit. But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up. A storm blew in that no one was anticipating. You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit. And there were climbers on that summit ridge. This is a picture of me in that area taken a year before  and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather. I have an oxygen hose connected here. You can see on this climber  we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack    little titanium tanks  very lightweight    and we're not carrying much else. This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge. OK  this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself. This is on the way toward the summit  on that       foot bridge. All the climbers here are climbing unroped  and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody  you'd wind up just pulling them off with you. So each person climbs individually. And it's not a straight path at all  it's very difficult climbing  and there's always the risk of falling on either side. If you fall to your left  you're going to fall       feet into Nepal  if you fall to your right  you're going to fall        feet into Tibet. So it's probably better to fall into Tibet because you'll live longer. But  either way  you fall for the rest of your life. OK. Those climbers were up near the summit  along that summit ridge that you see up there  and I was down here in Camp Three. My expedition was down in Camp Three  while these guys were up there in the storm. The storm was so fierce that we had to lay  fully dressed  fully equipped  laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain. It was the worst winds I've ever seen. And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher        feet higher  and completely exposed to the elements. We were in radio contact with some of them. This is a view taken along the summit ridge. Rob Hall  we heard by radio  was up here  at this point in the storm with Doug Hansen. And we heard that Rob was OK  but Doug was too weak to come down. He was exhausted  and Rob was staying with him. We also got some bad news in the storm that Beck Weathers  another climber  had collapsed in the snow and was dead. There were still    other climbers that we weren't aware of their condition. They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain  all the stories were confusing  most of them were conflicting. We really had no idea what was going on during that storm. We were just hunkered down in our tents at Camp Three. Our two strongest climbers  Todd Burleson and Pete Athans  decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going. They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall  who was a superb climber stuck  sort of  with a weak climber up near the summit. I expected them to say to Rob   Hold on. We're coming.  But in fact  what they said was   Leave Doug and come down yourself. There's no chance of saving him  and just try to save yourself at this point.  And Rob got that message  but his answer was   We're both listening.  Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge  up in here  and it was a scene of complete chaos up there. But they did what they could to stabilize the people. I gave them radio advice from Camp Three  and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power. The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four. So the climbers were coming down along this route. This is taken from Camp Three  where I was. And they all came by me so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them  which is really not much  because Camp Three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a    degree angle. You can barely stand outside the tent. It's really cold  it's        feet. The only supplies I had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids. So  as the climbers came by me  I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down. The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated  I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain. It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes I even gave the injections right through their clothes. It was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there. While I was taking care of them  we got more news about Rob Hall. There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him. He called in to say that he was alone now. Apparently  Doug had died higher up on the mountain. But Rob was now too weak to come down himself  and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude  he was just beyond rescue and he knew it. At that point  he asked to be paged into his wife. He was carrying a radio. His wife was home in New Zealand  seven months pregnant with their first child  and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done  and Rob and his wife had their last conversation. They picked the name for their baby. Rob then signed off  and that was the last we ever heard of him. I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at        feet  which was an impossibility. So what we did was  we got the victims down to        feet  where it was easier for me to treat them. This was my medical kit. It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies. This is what I carried up the mountain. I had more supplies lower down  which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp. And this was scene at the lower camp. The survivors came in one by one. Some of them were hypothermic  some of them were frostbitten  some were both. What we did was try to warm them up as best we could  put oxygen on them and try to revive them  which is difficult to do at        feet  when the tent is freezing. This is some severe frostbite on the feet  severe frostbite on the nose. This climber was snow blind. As I was taking care of these climbers  we got a startling experience. Out of nowhere  Beck Weathers  who we had already been told was dead  stumbled into the tent  just like a mummy  he walked into the tent. I expected him to be incoherent  but  in fact  he walked into the tent and said to me   Hi  Ken. Where should I sit   And then he said   Do you accept my health insurance   He really said that. So he was completely lucid  but he was very severely frostbitten. You can see his hand is completely white  his face  his nose  is burned. First  it turns white  and then when it's completed necrosis  it turns black  and then it falls off. It's the last stage  just like a scar. So  as I was taking care of Beck  he related what had been going on up there. He said he had gotten lost in the storm  collapsed in the snow  and just laid there  unable to move. Some climbers had come by and looked at him  and he heard them say   He's dead.  But Beck wasn't dead  he heard that  but he was completely unable to move. He was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings  but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive. So the climbers passed him by  and Beck lay there for a day  a night and another day  in the snow. And then he said to himself   I don't want to die. I have a family to come back to.  And the thoughts of his family  his kids and his wife  generated enough energy  enough motivation in him  so that he actually got up. After laying in the snow that long a time  he got up and found his way back to the camp. And Beck told me that story very quietly  but I was absolutely stunned by it. I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up. He apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia. And I can only try to speculate on how he did it. So  what if we had Beck hooked up to a SPECT scan  something that could actually measure brain function  Just very simply  the three parts of the brain  the frontal lobe  where you focus your attention and concentration  you have the temporal lobe  where you form images and keep memories  and the posterior part of your brain  which contains the cerebellum  which controls motion  and the brain stem  where you have your basic maintenance functions  like heartbeat and respiration. So let's take a cut through the brain here  and imagine that Beck was hooked up to a SPECT scan. This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain. So you have the prefrontal cortex here  lighting up in red. This is a pretty evenly distributed scan. You have the middle area  where the temporal lobe might be  in here  and the posterior portion  where the maintenance functions are in the back. This is a roughly normal scan  showing equal distribution of energy. Now  you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up. This might be what Beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger. He's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble. These parts of the brain are quieting down. He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point  and he's working pretty hard. He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this. OK  but he's losing ground here. He's running out of energy. It's too cold  he can't keep his metabolic fires going  and  you see  there's no more red here  his brain is quieting down. He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet  there's very little red anywhere. Beck is powering down. He's dying. You go on to the next scan  but  in Beck's case  you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again. He's beginning to think about his family. He's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up. He's developing energy in this area through thought. And this is how he's going to turn thought back into action. This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus. It's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists. This is where people make decisions  where they develop willpower. And  you can see  there's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain  where he's got images of his family  into this area  which is powering his will. Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor. He's going to develop enough energy in that area    after a day  a night and a day    to actually motivate himself to get up. And you can see here  he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe. He's beginning to focus  he can concentrate now. He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself. So this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain  and it's getting quieter down here  but he's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going. And then  that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas. He's not thinking about his family now  and he's getting himself motivated. This is the posterior part  where his muscles are going to be moving  and he's going to be pacing himself. His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed. So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic. So here I am taking care of Beck at        feet  and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself. It just shows you what the power of the mind can do. He was critically ill  there were other critically ill patients  luckily  we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys. A helicopter came in at        feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history. It was able to land on the ice  take away Beck and the other survivors  one by one  and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp. This is a scene at base camp  at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost. And we had a memorial service there a few days later. These are Serphas lighting juniper branches. They believe juniper smoke is holy. And the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit  turning to the mountain  actually  to talk to them directly. There were five climbers lost here. This was Scott Fischer  Rob Hall  Andy Harris  Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba. And one more climber should have died that day  but didn't  and that's Beck Weathers. He was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower  he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself. These are Tibetan prayer flags. These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags  the message will be carried up to the gods  and that year  Beck's message was answered. Thank you. So  I was just asked to go and shoot this film called  Elizabeth.  And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying   She's a fantastic woman  she does everything. How are we going to introduce her   So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer  and they came to me and said   Shekhar  what do you think   And I said   I think she's dancing.  And I could see everybody looked at me  somebody said   Bollywood.  The other said   How much did we hire him for   And the third said   Let's find another director.  I thought I had better change. So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth  and I said   OK  maybe I am too Bollywood. Maybe Elizabeth  this great icon  dancing  What are you talking about   So I rethought the whole thing  and then we all came to a consensus. And here was the introduction of this great British icon called  Elizabeth.  Leicester  May I join you  my lady  Elizabeth  If it please you  sir. Shekhar Kapur  So she was dancing. So how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love  that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life  and she was youthful  And how many of you did not get that  That's the power of visual storytelling  that's the power of dance  that's the power of music  the power of not knowing. When I go out to direct a film  every day we prepare too much  we think too much. Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom. You know  simple words lost in the quicksand of experience. So I come up  and I say   What am I going to do today   I'm not going to do what I planned to do  and I put myself into absolute panic. It's my one way of getting rid of my mind  getting rid of this mind that says   Hey  you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing. You're a director  you've done it for years.  So I've got to get there and be in complete panic. It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script  I go and I panic myself  I get scared. I'm doing it right now  you can watch me. I'm getting nervous  I don't know what to say  I don't know what I'm doing  I don't want to go there. And as I go there  of course  my A.D. says   You know what you're going to do  sir.  I say   Of course I do.  And the studio executives  they would say   Hey  look at Shekhar. He's so prepared.  And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan because he's chaotic. I'm allowing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos  I'm hoping some moments of truth will come. All preparation is preparation. I don't even know if it's honest. I don't even know if it's truthful. The truth of it all comes on the moment  organically  and if you get five great moments of great  organic stuff in your storytelling  in your film  your film  audiences will get it. So I'm looking for those moments  and I'm standing there and saying   I don't know what to say.  So  ultimately  everybody's looking at you      people at seven in the morning who got there at quarter to seven  and you arrived at seven  and everybody's saying   Hey. What's the first thing  What's going to happen   And you put yourself into a state of panic where you don't know  and so you don't know. And so  because you don't know  you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe that something    I'm going to try and access the universe the way Einstein    say a prayer    accessed his equations  the same source. I'm looking for the same source because creativity comes from absolutely the same source that you meditate somewhere outside yourself  outside the universe. You're looking for something that comes and hits you. Until that hits you  you're not going to do the first shot. So what do you do  So Cate says   Shekhar  what do you want me to do   And I say   Cate  what do you want to do    Laughter   You're a great actor  and I like to give to my actors    why don't you show me what you want to do   What am I doing  I'm trying to buy time. I'm trying to buy time. So the first thing about storytelling that I learned  and I follow all the time is  Panic. Panic is the great access of creativity because that's the only way to get rid of your mind. Get rid of your mind. Get out of it  get it out. And let's go to the universe because there's something out there that is more truthful than your mind  that is more truthful than your universe.  unclear   you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it because that's what I follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere  the emptiness. Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity. So that's what I do. When I was a kid    I was about eight years old. You remember how India was. There was no pollution. In Delhi  we used to live    we used to call it a chhat or the khota. Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace    and we used to sleep out at night. At school I was being just taught about physics  and I was told that if there is something that exists  then it is measurable. If it is not measurable  it does not exist. And at night I would lie out  looking at the unpolluted sky  as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid  and I used to stare at the universe and say   How far does this universe go   My father was a doctor. And I would think   Daddy  how far does the universe go   And he said   Son  it goes on forever.  So I said   Please measure forever because in school they're teaching me that if I cannot measure it  it does not exist. It doesn't come into my frame of reference.  So  how far does eternity go  What does forever mean  And I would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity. So what did I do  At that time  at the tender age of seven  I created a story. What was my story  And I don't know why  but I remember the story. There was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood  and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax. And when that ax hits that piece of wood  that's when everything will destroy and the Big Bang will happen again. But all before that there was a woodcutter. And then when I would run out of that story  I would imagine that woodcutter's universe is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter. So every time  I could tell my story again and again and get over this problem  and so I got over the problem. How did I do it  Tell a story. So what is a story  A story is our    all of us    we are the stories we tell ourselves. In this universe  and this existence  where we live with this duality of whether we exist or not and who are we  the stories we tell ourselves are the stories that define the potentialities of our existence. We are the stories we tell ourselves. So that's as wide as we look at stories. A story is the relationship that you develop between who you are  or who you potentially are  and the infinite world  and that's our mythology. We tell our stories  and a person without a story does not exist. So Einstein told a story and followed his stories and came up with theories and came up with theories and then came up with his equations. Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him  and he went out to conquer the world. We all  everybody  has a story that they follow. We tell ourselves stories. So  I will go further  and I say   I tell a story  and therefore I exist.  I exist because there are stories  and if there are no stories  we don't exist. We create stories to define our existence. If we do not create the stories  we probably go mad. I don't know  I'm not sure  but that's what I've done all the time. Now  a film. A film tells a story. I often wonder when I make a film    I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha    and I often wonder  If Buddha had all the elements that are given to a director    if he had music  if he had visuals  if he had a video camera    would we get Buddhism better  But that puts some kind of burden on me. I have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way  but I have the potential. It's called subtext. When I first went to Hollywood  they said    I used to talk about subtext  and my agent came to me   Would you kindly not talk about subtext   And I said   Why   He said   Because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext. Just talk about plot and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film  what the visuals will be.  So when I look at a film  here's what we look for  We look for a story on the plot level  then we look for a story on the psychological level  then we look for a story on the political level  then we look at a story on a mythological level. And I look for stories on each level. Now  it is not necessary that these stories agree with each other. What is wonderful is  at many times  the stories will contradict with each other. So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician  I often tell him   Don't follow what the script already says. Find that which is not. Find the truth for yourself  and when you find the truth for yourself  there will be a truth in it  but it may contradict the plot  but don't worry about it.  So  the sequel to  Elizabeth    Golden Age.  When I made the sequel to  Elizabeth   here was a story that the writer was telling  A woman who was threatened by Philip II and was going to war  and was going to war  fell in love with Walter Raleigh. Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh  she was giving up the reasons she was a queen  and then Walter Raleigh fell in love with her lady in waiting  and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted... Here's the story I was telling  The gods up there  there were two people. There was Philip II  who was divine because he was always praying  and there was Elizabeth  who was divine  but not quite divine because she thought she was divine  but the blood of being mortal flowed in her. But the divine one was unjust  so the gods said   OK  what we need to do is help the just one.  And so they helped the just one. And what they did was  they sent Walter Raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self. And the mortal self was the girl that Walter Raleigh was sent  and gradually he separated her so she was free to be divine. And the two divine people fought  and the gods were on the side of divinity. Of course  all the British press got really upset. They said   We won the Armada.  But I said   But the storm won the Armada. The gods sent the storm.  So what was I doing  I was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film. Of course  when I asked Cate Blanchett  I said   What's the film about   She said   The film's about a woman coming to terms with growing older.  Psychological. The writer said  It's about history  plot.  I said  It's about mythology  the gods.  So let me show you a film    a piece from that film    and how a camera also    so this is a scene  where in my mind  she was at the depths of mortality. She was discovering what mortality actually means  and if she is at the depths of mortality  what really happens. And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality and why she should break away from mortality. Remember  in the film  to me  both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body  one the mortal self and one the spirit self. So can we have that second  Elizabeth  Bess  Bess  Bess Throckmorton  Bess  Here  my lady. Elizabeth  Tell me  is it true  Are you with child  Are you with child  Bess  Yes  my lady. Elizabeth  Traitorous. You dare to keep secrets from me  You ask my permission before you rut  before you breed. My bitches wear my collars. Do you hear me  Do you hear me  Walsingham  Majesty. Please  dignity. Mercy. Elizabeth  This is no time for mercy  Walsingham. You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business. Is it his  Tell me. Say it. Is the child his  Is it his  Bess  Yes. My lady  it is my husband's child. Elizabeth  Bitch   Cries  Raleigh  Majesty. This is not the queen I love and serve. Elizabeth  This man has seduced a ward of the queen  and she has married without royal consent. These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him. Go. You no longer have the queen's protection. Bess  As you wish  Majesty. Elizabeth  Get out  Get out  Get out  Get out. Shekhar Kapur  So  what am I trying to do here  Elizabeth has realized  and she's coming face to face with her own sense of jealousy  her own sense of mortality. What am I doing with the architecture  The architecture is telling a story. The architecture is telling a story about how  even though she's the most powerful woman in the world at that time  there is the other  the architecture's bigger. The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic. It'll survive her. So it's telling you  to me  stone is part of her destiny. Not only that  why is the camera looking down  The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well. She's in the absolute well of her own sense of being mortal. That's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality  come in  release her spirit. And that's the moment where  in my mind  both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person. But that's the moment she's surgically removing herself from that. So the film is operating on many many levels in that scene. And how we tell stories visually  with music  with actors  and at each level it's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other. So how do I start all this  What's the process of telling a story  About ten years ago  I heard this little thing from a politician  not a politician that was very well respected in India. And he said that these people in the cities  in one flush  expend as much water as you people in the rural areas don't get for your family for two days. That struck a chord  and I said   That's true.  I went to see a friend of mine  and he made me wait in his apartment in Malabar Hill on the twentieth floor  which is a really  really upmarket area in Mumbai. And he was having a shower for    minutes. I got bored and left  and as I drove out  I drove past the slums of Bombay  as you always do  and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun of women and children with buckets waiting for a tanker to come and give them water. And an idea started to develop. So how does that become a story  I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster. So my next film is called  Paani  which means water. And now  out of the mythology of that  I'm starting to create a world. What kind of world do I create  and where does the idea  the design of that come  So  in my mind  in the future  they started to build flyovers. You understand flyovers  Yeah  They started to build flyovers to get from A to B faster  but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth. And then what they did was they created a city above the flyovers. And the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities  about    to    percent of the people have moved to the upper city. Now  where does this upper city and lower city come  There's a mythology in India about    where they say  and I'll say it in Hindi   Hindi  Right. What does that mean  It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor. So  from that mythology  the upper city and lower city come. So the design has a story. And now  what happens is that the people of the upper city  they suck up all the water. Remember the word I said  suck up. They suck up all the water  keep to themselves  and they drip feed the lower city. And if there's any revolution  they cut off the water. And  because democracy still exists  there's a democratic way in which you say  Well  if you give us what  we want   we'll give you water.  So  okay my time is up. But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories  and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in  which is film. But ultimately  what is a story  It's a contradiction. Everything's a contradiction. The universe is a contradiction. And all of us are constantly looking for harmony. When you get up  the night and day is a contradiction. But you get up at   a.m. That first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other. Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you  but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that. All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony. It's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind  a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind. In a storyteller's mind  it's a contradiction of moralities. In a poet's mind  it's a conflict of words  in the universe's mind  between day and night. In the mind of a man and a woman  we're looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female  we're looking for harmony within each other. The whole idea of contradiction  but the acceptance of contradiction is the telling of a story  not the resolution. The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood and many films  and as  unclear  was saying in his  that we try to resolve the contradiction. Harmony is not resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment. Resolution is something that is far more limited. It is finite  harmony is infinite. So that storytelling  like all other contradictions in the universe  is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions  resolving one  but letting another go  letting another go and creating a question that is really important. Thank you very much. I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values. Now  it's generally understood that questions of morality    questions of good and evil and right and wrong    are questions about which science officially has no opinion. It's thought that science can help us get what we value  but it can never tell us what we ought to value. And  consequently  most people    I think most people probably here    think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life  questions like   What is worth living for    What is worth dying for    What constitutes a good life   So  I'm going to argue that this is an illusion    that the separation between science and human values is an illusion    and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history. Now  it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values  because science deals with facts  and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres. It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be. But I think this is quite clearly untrue. Values are a certain kind of fact. They are facts about the well being of conscious creatures. Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks  Why don't we feel compassion for rocks  It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects  as indeed we are  it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering. Now  the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim  This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects. And there's no notion  no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes. Even if you get your values from religion  even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death    either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell    you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes. And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim  which  of course  may or may not be true. Now  to speak about the conditions of well being in this life  for human beings  we know that there is a continuum of such facts. We know that it's possible to live in a failed state  where everything that can go wrong does go wrong    where mothers cannot feed their children  where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration  where people are murdered indiscriminately. And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic  to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable. And we know    we know    that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space. Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea  Probably not. Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye  so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors  Probably not. There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish  whether or not we understand these truths. And morality relates to these truths. So  in talking about values we are talking about facts. Now  of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels    from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements. But if we're going to talk about human well being we are  of necessity  talking about the human brain. Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain    whatever happens after death. Even if the suicide bomber does get    virgins in the afterlife  in this life  his personality    his rather unfortunate personality    is the product of his brain. So the contributions of culture    if culture changes us  as indeed it does  it changes us by changing our brains. And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can  at least in principle  be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind    neuroscience  psychology  etc. So  what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts    to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings. And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings. And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape  with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well being of conscious creatures  both personal and collective. And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well being that we rarely access  that few people access. And these await our discovery. Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual. Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them. Now  let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space  or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question. I don't think  for instance  that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child  or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities  or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense. But if questions affect human well being then they do have answers  whether or not we can find them. And just admitting this    just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish    will change the way we talk about morality  and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future. For instance  there are    states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal  where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board  hard  and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin. And hundreds of thousands of children  incidentally  are subjected to this every year. The locations of these enlightened districts  I think  will fail to surprise you. We're not talking about Connecticut. And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious. The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod  lest we spoil the child    this is in Proverbs    and     and I believe    . But we can ask the obvious question  Is it a good idea  generally speaking  to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior  Is there any doubt that this question has an answer  and that it matters  Now  many of you might worry that the notion of well being is truly undefined  and seemingly perpetually open to be re construed. And so  how therefore can there be an objective notion of well being  Well  consider by analogy  the concept of physical health. The concept of physical health is undefined. As we just heard from Michael Specter  it has changed over the years. When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably   . It's now around    in the developed world. There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age     will be considered a profound disability. People will send you donations when you're in that condition. Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open  genuinely open for revision  does not make it vacuous. The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science. Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape  There may be equivalent ways to thrive  there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing. Now  why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality  Well think of how we talk about food  I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat. There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food. But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison. The fact that there are many right answers to the question   What is food   does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition. Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions. So  for instance  if it's really wrong to lie  it must always be wrong to lie  and if you can find an exception  well then there's no such thing as moral truth. Why would we think this  Consider  by analogy  the game of chess. Now  if you're going to play good chess  a principle like   Don't lose your Queen   is very good to follow. But it clearly admits some exceptions. There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do. There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do. And yet  chess is a domain of perfect objectivity. The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all. Now  this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere. Consider the great problem of women's bodies  What to do about them  Well this is one thing you can do about them  You can cover them up. Now  it is the position  generally speaking  of our intellectual community that while we may not like this  we might think of this as  wrong  in Boston or Palo Alto  who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags  And who are we to say  even  that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable  or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way  Well  who are we not to say this  Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well being that we have to be non judgmental about a practice like this  I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil    women should be able to wear whatever they want  as far as I'm concerned. But what does voluntary mean in a community where  when a girl gets raped  her father's first impulse  rather often  is to murder her out of shame  Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute  Your daughter gets raped  and what you want to do is kill her. What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing  Now  to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society. For instance  this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world. Now  granted  for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images. But if we are in a reflective mood  we can ask   Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies   I mean  is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children  Probably not. OK  so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance. Perhaps there are many such places    again  given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape. But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak. Now the irony  from my perspective  is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another. And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind  not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well being. In fact  the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering. This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue. But the demagogues are right about one thing  We need a universal conception of human values. Now  what stands in the way of this  Well  one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality    especially secular  academic  scientist types. When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives. So  for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion  and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness. On the other hand  we have someone like Ted Bundy  Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women. So  we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time. Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say   Well  there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about    really right about    or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science. He likes chocolate  he likes vanilla. There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other.  Notice that we don't do this in science. On the left you have Edward Witten. He's a string theorist. If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around  in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten. The other half will tell you they don't like the question. So  what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said  String theory is bogus. It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale. I'm not a fan.  Well  nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist  I don't understand string theory. I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory. I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member. But this is just the point. Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded. That is what it is to have a domain of expertise. That is what it is for knowledge to count. How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise  or moral talent  or moral genius even  How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count  How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering  Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering  No. How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well being  So  this  I think  is what the world needs now. It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing  and morality relates to that domain of facts. It is possible for individuals  and even for whole cultures  to care about the wrong things  which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering. Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality. We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less  and they will one day mean nothing. We live in a world filled with destructive technology  and this technology cannot be uninvented  it will always be easier to break things than to fix them. It seems to me  therefore  patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads  or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes. We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life. And to do that  we have to admit that these questions have answers. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So  some combustible material there. Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world  hearing some of this  may well be doing the screaming with rage thing  after as well  some of them. Language seems to be really important here. When you're talking about the veil  you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags. I've lived in the Muslim world  spoken with a lot of Muslim women. And some of them would say something else. They would say   No  you know  this is a celebration of female specialness  it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that     and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view     that male lust is not to be trusted.  I mean  can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist  Sam Harris  Yeah  well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence  watching the clock ticking  but the question is  What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations  and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself  And so  if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil  or a very funny hat  or tattoo their face    I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want  but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under. And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it  especially when it's     degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa. CA  A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress. But can you reconcile that  I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional  where we all have to think the same. Paint your picture of what rolling the clock    years forward      years forward  how you would like to think of the world  balancing moral progress with richness. SH  Well  I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail  then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail. So  we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion  and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it    whether they're genetic  whether they're how people talk to one another  whether they're economic systems  and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space. So  everything is not going to be up for grabs. It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated in the context of men who do desire women. I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea    but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them. Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems  And I think there are clearly right answers to that. CA  And if the results come out that actually they do  are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues  SH  Well yeah  modulo one obvious fact  that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system. So  you can say like   Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend  I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do.  If you get all those parts aligned  yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love. But again  then we have to talk about well being in a larger context. It's all of us in this together  not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus. CA  Sam  this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours. We don't have that  but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED. SH  Really an honor. Thank you. Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna  especially birds  and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month  and transported far from their origins  to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and S o Paulo. It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost    million animals every year  a business worth almost two billion dollars. The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals  intended to supply the pet market  or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses  and this is how we end up  every month  with thousands of seized animals. And for us to understand what happens with them  we're going to follow Brad. In the eyes of many people  after the animals are seized  they say   Yay  justice has been served. The good guys arrived  took the cute  mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers  and everyone lived happily ever after.  But did they  Actually  no  and this is where many of our problems begin. Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals. In Brazil  they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities  in which most of the cases  the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers. In       these centers received        animals  of which        were birds. And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked. Some lucky ones    and among them  Brad    go to serious rehabilitation centers after that. And in these places they are cared for. They train their flying  they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature  and they are able to socialize with others from the same species. But then what  The Brazil Ornithological Society    so now we're talking only birds    claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature. Therefore  it would be too risky to release these animals  both for the released and for the natural populations. They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation. Following this argument  they suggest that all the birds seized from non threatened species should be euthanized. However  this would mean having killed        birds  only in the state of S o Paulo  only in     . But  some researchers  myself included    some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government    believe there is an alternative. We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health  behavior  inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations  then technically responsible releases are possible  both for the well being of the individual  and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems  because we will be returning genes for these populations    which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges    and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers  predators  preys  etc. All of these were released by us. On the top  the turtles are just enjoying freedom. On the middle  this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release. And on the bottom  my personal favorite  the little male over there  four hours after his release he was together with a wild female. So  this is not new  people have been doing this around the world. But it's still a big issue in Brazil. We believe we have performed responsible releases. We've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks. So  these genes are indeed going back to the populations. However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge. So  I say   Let's study more  let's shed light on this issue  let's do whatever we can.  I'm devoting my career to that. And I'm here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach  Talk to your neighbor  teach your children  make sure your pet is from a legal breeder. We need to act  and act now  before these ones are the only ones left. Thank you very much. So  basically we have public leaders  public officials who are out of control  they are writing bills that are unintelligible  and out of these bills are going to come maybe        pages of regulations  total complexity  which has a dramatically negative impact on our life. If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits  if you're trying to get a small business loan  you face a blizzard of paperwork. What are we going to do about it  I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity  transparency and empathy  building humanity into communications. I've been simplifying things for    years. I come out of the advertising and design business. My focus is understanding you people  and how you interact with the government to get your benefits  how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with  and how you view brands. So  very quickly  when President Obama said   I don't see why we can't have a one page  plain English consumer credit agreement.  So  I locked myself in a room  figured out the content  organized the document  and wrote it in plain English. I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country. This is a real thing. Now  I went one step further and said   Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document  Let's go online.  And many people might need help in computation. Working with the Harvard Business School  you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment  If you spent    dollars for a meal  the longer you take to pay out that loan  you see  over a period of time using the minimum payment it's    dollars and    cents. How about that  Do you think your bank is going to show that to people  But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids. And what about terms like  over the limit   Perhaps a stealth thing. Define it in context. Tell people what it means. When you put it in plain English  you almost force the institution to give the people a way  a default out of that  and not put themselves at risk. Plain English is about changing the content. And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM. It's a grid  it's a calendar. At such and such a date  IBM has responsibilities  you have responsibilities. Received very favorably by business. And there is some good news to report today. Each year  one in    taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS. There are     million letters that go out. Running through this typical letter that they had  I ran it through my simplicity lab  it's pretty unintelligible. All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible. We looked at doing over       letters that cover    percent of their transactions in plain English. They have been tested in the laboratory. When I run it through my lab  this heat mapping shows everything is intelligible. And the IRS has introduced the program. There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention. There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency  how to mandate simplicity. We see all this complexity. It's incumbent upon us  and this organization  I believe  to make clarity  transparency and empathy a national priority. There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate. There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. So  how are we going to change the world  Make clarity  transparency and simplicity a national priority. I thank you. I want to talk about  .  billion years of history in    minutes. That's     million years per minute. Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained of planet Mars. This is fly by  Mariner IV. It was taken in     . When this picture appeared  that well known scientific journal  The New York Times  wrote in its editorial   Mars is uninteresting. It's a dead world. NASA should not spend any time or effort studying Mars anymore.  Fortunately  our leaders in Washington at NASA headquarters knew better and we began a very extensive study of the red planet. One of the key questions in all of science   Is there life outside of Earth   I believe that Mars is the most likely target for life outside the Earth. I'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on Mars. But let me start with a Viking photograph. This is a composite taken by Viking in     . Viking was developed and managed at the NASA Langley Research Center. We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of     . We had four spacecraft  two around Mars  two on the surface    an amazing accomplishment. This is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet. This is a Viking Lander photograph of the surface of Mars. And yes  the red planet is red. Mars is half the size of the Earth  but because two thirds of the Earth is covered by water  the land area on Mars is comparable to the land area on Earth. So  Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size. We have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of Mars. We understand the elevation differences. We know a lot about Mars. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system  Olympus Mons. Mars has the Grand Canyon of the solar system  Valles Marineris. Very  very interesting planet. Mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system  Hellas Basin. This is       miles across. If you happened to be on Mars when this impactor hit  it was a really bad day on Mars. This is Olympus Mons. This is bigger than the state of Arizona. Volcanoes are important  because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans. We're looking at Valles Marineris  the largest canyon in the solar system  superimposed on a map of the United States        miles across. One of the most intriguing features about Mars  the National Academy of Science says one of the    major mysteries of the space age  is why certain areas of Mars are so highly magnetized. We call this crustal magnetism. There are regions on Mars  where  for some reason    we don't understand why at this point    the surface is very  very highly magnetized. Is there water on Mars  The answer is no  there is no liquid water on the surface of Mars today. But there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of Mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water. Today Mars is very very dry. We believe there's some water in the polar caps  there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole. Here are some recent images. This is from Spirit and Opportunity. These images that show at one time  there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars. Why is water important  Water is important because if you want life you have to have water. Water is the key ingredient in the evolution  the origin of life on a planet. Here is some picture of Antarctica and a picture of Olympus Mons  very similar features  glaciers. So  this is frozen water. This is ice water on Mars. This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago. It has not been seen publicly. This is European space agency Mars Express  image of a crater on Mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water  we have ice. Very intriguing photograph. We now believe that in the early history of Mars  which is  .  billion years ago   .  billion years ago  Mars was very Earth like. Mars had rivers  Mars had lakes  but more important Mars had planetary scale oceans. We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere  and this area in blue  which shows a depression of about four miles  was the ancient ocean area on the surface of Mars. Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go  Well  we have an idea. This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a Mars orbiting satellite called Odyssey. Sub surface water on Mars  frozen in the form of ice. And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color  it means    percent by weight. Sixteen percent  by weight  of the interior contains frozen water  or ice. So  there is a lot of water below the surface. The most intriguing and puzzling measurement  in my opinion  we've obtained of Mars  was released earlier this year in the magazine Science. And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane  CH   in the atmosphere of Mars. And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane. Why is methane important  Because on Earth  almost all      .  percent    of the methane is produced by living systems  not little green men  but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface. We now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars  a gas that  on Earth  is biogenic in origin  produced by living systems. These are the three plumes  A  B   B . And this is the terrain it appears over  and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars. In fact  the Earth and Mars are both  .  billion years old. The oldest rock on Earth is only  .  billion. The reason there is a billion year gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics  The crust of the Earth has been recycled. We have no geological record prior for the first billion years. That record exists on Mars. And this terrain that we're looking at dates back to  .  billion years when Earth and Mars were formed. It was a Tuesday. This is a map that shows where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars. Here is Viking I  Viking II. This is Opportunity. This is Spirit. This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix  we just put two years ago. Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers have gone to the northern hemisphere. That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin. There aren't many craters. And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites. But look in the southern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters  there are volcanic craters. Here's Hellas Basin  a very very different place  geologically. Look where the methane is  the methane is in a very rough terrain area. What is the best way to unravel the mysteries on Mars that exist  We asked this question    years ago. We invited    of the top Mars scientists to the Langley Research Center for two days. We addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered. And we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question. And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket powered airplane we call ARES. It's an Aerial Regional scale Environmental Surveyor. There's a model of ARES here. This is a    percent scale model. This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center. If any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on Mars  it's the Langley Research Center  for almost     years a leading center of aeronautics in the world. We fly about a mile above the surface. We cover hundreds of miles  and we fly about     miles an hour. We can do things that rovers can't do and landers can't do  We can fly above mountains  volcanoes  impact craters  we fly over valleys  we can fly over surface magnetism  the polar caps  subsurface water  and we can search for life on Mars. But  of equal importance  as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars  we transmit that journey  the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth  we transmit those images back to Earth. And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars. But more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists  technologists  engineers and mathematicians. And that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality  to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists  engineers  mathematicians and technologists. This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars. We preprogram it. We will fly where the methane is. We will have instruments aboard the plane that will sample  every three minutes  the atmosphere of Mars. We will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems. We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from  because we can measure the gradient where it comes from  and there  we can direct the next mission to land right in that area. How do we transport an airplane to Mars  In two words  very carefully. The problem is we don't fly it to Mars  we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars. The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet  ARES is    foot wingspan     feet long. How do we get it to Mars  We fold it  and we transport it in a spacecraft. And we have it in something called an aeroshell. This is how we do it. And we have a little video that describes the sequence. Video  Seven  six. Green board. Five  four  three  two  one. Main engine start  and liftoff. Joel Levine  This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to Mars. It enters the atmosphere of Mars. A lot of heating  frictional heating. It's going    thousand miles an hour. A parachute opens up to slow it down. The thermal tiles fall off. The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time. It unfolds. The rocket engine begins. We believe that in a one hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on Mars by making high resolution measurements of the atmosphere  looking for gases of biogenic origin  looking for gases of volcanic origin  studying the surface  studying the magnetism on the surface  which we don't understand  as well as about a dozen other areas. Practice makes perfect. How do we know we can do it  Because we have tested ARES model  several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years  under Mars conditions. And  of equal importance is  we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere  at         feet  which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly. Now          feet  if you fly cross country to Los Angeles  you fly        feet. We do our tests at         feet. And I want to show you one of our tests. This is a half scale model. This is a high altitude helium balloon. This is over Tilamook  Oregon. We put the folded airplane on the balloon    it took about three hours to get up there    and then we released it on command at         feet  and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly. And we've done high altitude and low altitude tests  just to perfect this technique. We're ready to go. I have a scale model here. But we have a full scale model in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center. We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters to cover the costs. I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk for this mission. There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing. This is the ARES team  we have about     scientists  engineers  where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory  Goddard Space Flight Center  Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this. It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center. And let me conclude by saying not too far from here  right down the road in Kittyhawk  North Carolina  a little more than     years ago history was made when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth. We are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the Earth's atmosphere. We are prepared to fly this on Mars  rewrite the textbook about Mars. If you're interested in more information  we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission  and why we want to do it. Thank you very much. One day  Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music. And the source was a man  an African American man  charming  rugged  homeless  playing a violin that only had two strings. And I'm telling a story that many of you know  because Steve's columns became the basis for a book  which was turned into a movie  with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez  and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers  the Juilliard trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard  he suffered a complete breakdown  and    years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men  but how music helped shape that bond  and ultimately was instrumental    if you'll pardon the pun    in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. I met Mr. Ayers in       two years ago  at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies  and came backstage and introduced himself. He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series  all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. And we got talking about music  and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. Now  I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs  and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result now  he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes  the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days  wandering the streets of Skid Row  exposed to its horrors  with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him. And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall    he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes  he was lost. And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke  and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. And I was afraid  not for myself  but I was afraid that I was going to lose him  that he was going to sink into one of his states  and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. So  I just started playing. And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. And as I played  I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical  a chemical reaction  for which my playing the music was its catalyst. And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding  a quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle  he lifted his own violin and he started playing  by ear  certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete    Mendelssohn  Tchaikovsky  Sibelius. And we started talking about music  from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms  Bruckner  all the B's  from Bart k  all the way up to Esa Pekka Salonen. And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music  but he related to this music at a personal level. He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music  this man had transformed from the paranoid  disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming  erudite  brilliant  Juilliard trained musician. Music is medicine. Music changes us. And for Nathaniel  music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity  into reality. And that is an escape from his tormented state. And I understood that this was the very essence of art. This was the very reason why we made music  that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core  our emotions  and through our artistic lens  through our creativity  we're able to shape those emotions into reality. And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us  inspires and unites us. And for Nathaniel  music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him  that recognized his talents and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel  whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row  because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Thanks. Robert Gupta. Robert Gupta  I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. So  please forgive me. You know for me  the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that I picked up in London. It was the early '  s  and I was at a public event. I saw this leaflet and it said   There are millions of slaves in the world today.  And I thought   No way  no way.  And I'm going to admit to hubris. Because I also  I'm going to admit to you  I also thought   How can I be like a hot shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this  So it can't be true.  Well  if you teach  if you worship in the temple of learning  do not mock the gods  because they will take you  fill you with curiosity and desire  and drive you. Drive you with a passion to change things. I went out and did a lit review        articles on the key word  slavery.  Two turned out to be about contemporary    only two. All the rest were historical. They were press pieces and they were full of outrage  they were full of speculation  they were anecdotal    no solid information. So  I began to do a research project of my own. I went to five countries around the world. I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders  and I looked very deeply into slave based businesses because this is an economic crime. People do not enslave people to be mean to them. They do it to make a profit. And I've got to tell you  what I found out in the world in four different continents  was depressingly familiar. Like this  Agricultural workers in Africa  whipped and beaten  showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew. It was mind blowing. And I want to be very clear. I'm talking about real slavery. This is not about lousy marriages  this is not about jobs that suck. This is about people who can not walk away  people who are forced to work without pay  people who are operating      under a threat of violence and have no pay. It's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history. Now  where is it  Well  this map in the sort of redder  yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery. But in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery. And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland where we can't find any cases of enslavement around the world. We're also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction. Around the world  slaves are used to destroy the environment  cutting down trees in the Amazon  destroying forest areas in West Africa  mining and spreading mercury around in places like Ghana and the Congo  destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia. It's a pretty harrowing linkage between what's happening to our environment and what's happening to our human rights. Now  how on Earth did we get to a situation like this  where we have    million people in slavery in the year       That's double the number that came out of Africa in the entire transatlantic slave trade. Well  it builds up with these factors. They are not causal  they are actually supporting factors. One we all know about  the population explosion  the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last    years. Being numerous does not make you a slave. Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world  caused by civil wars  ethnic conflicts  kleptocratic governments  disease ... you name it  you know it. We understand how that works. In some countries all of those things happen at once  like Sierra Leone a few years ago  and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world  in fact  as we know  live on the edge  live in situations where they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute. But that doesn't make you a slave either. What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave  is the absence of the rule of law. If the rule of law is sound  it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable. But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law  then if you can use violence  if you can use violence with impunity  you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery. Well  that is precisely what has happened around the world. Though  for a lot of people  the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head. They come into slavery because someone has asked them this question. All around the world I've been told an almost identical story. People say   I was home  someone came into our village  they stood up in the back of a truck  they said  'I've got jobs  who needs a job '  And they did exactly what you or I would do in the same situation. They said   That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious  but my children were hungry. We needed medicine. I knew I had to do anything I could to earn some money to support the people I care about.  They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them. Ten miles      miles        miles later  they find themselves in dirty  dangerous  demeaning work. They take it for a little while  but when they try to leave  bang   the hammer comes down  and they discover they're enslaved. Now  that kind of slavery is  again  pretty much what slavery has been all through human history. But there is one thing that is particularly remarkable and novel about slavery today  and that is a complete collapse in the price of human beings    expensive in the past  dirt cheap now. Even the business programs have started picking up on this. I just want to share a little clip for you. Daphne  OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here  as always  as we get macro and talk commodities. Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue  head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management. And we're also joined by Brent Lawson from Lawson Frisk Securities. Brent Lawson  Happy to be here. D  Good to have you with us  Brent. Now  gentlemen ... Brent  where is your money going this year  BL  Well Daphne  we've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider. We really like the human being story a lot. If you look at a long term chart  prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong. So  that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on. D  Michael  what's your take on the people story  Are you interested  Michael O'Donoghue  Oh definitely. Non voluntary labor's greatest advantage as an asset is the endless supply. We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that. BL  Daphne  if I may draw your attention to one thing. That is that private equity has been sniffing around  and that tells me that this market is about to explode. Africans and Indians  as usual  South Americans  and Eastern Europeans in particular are on our buy list. D  Interesting. Micheal  bottom line  what do you recommend  MO  We're recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy. There's no need to play the market. There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting. D  Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen  thank you very much. Kevin Bales  Okay  you figured it out. That's a spoof. Though I enjoyed watching your jaws drop  drop  drop  until you got it. MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof  and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction  which I think is kind of fun. Here's the reality. The price of human beings across the last       years in today's money has averaged about        dollars. Capital purchase items. You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes. The average price of a human being today  around the world  is about    dollars. They are more expensive in places like North America. Slaves cost between       to       dollars in North America  but I could take you places in India or Nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or    dollars. They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups. You buy them cheaply  you use them  you crumple them up  and then when you're done with them you just throw them away. These young boys are in Nepal. They are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder. There are no roads there  so they carry loads of stone on their backs  often of their own weight  up and down the Himalaya Mountains. One of their mothers said to us   You know  we can't survive here  but we can't even seem to die either.  It's a horrible situation. And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this  it's that there are also    in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved    there are ex slaves who are now working to free others. Or  we say  Frederick Douglass is in the house. I don't know if you've ever had a daydream about   Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman  What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass   I've got to say  one of the most exciting parts about my job is that I get to  and I want to introduce you to one of those. His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana enslaved in the fishing industry  and he now  after escape and building a new life  has formed an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery. This is not James  this is one of the kids that he works with. James Kofi Annan  Video   He was hit with a paddle in the head. And this reminds me of my childhood when I used to work here. KB  James and our country director in Ghana  Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in Ghana for enslaving people  from the fishing industry  for enslaving children. Now  everything I've been telling you  I admit  is pretty disheartening. But there is actually a very positive side to this  and that is this  The    million people who are in slavery today  that's a lot of people  but it's also the smallest fraction of the global population to ever be in slavery. And likewise  the    billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor. Slavery  illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society. And in a way  without us even noticing  has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction  waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it over. And get rid of it. And it can be done. Now  if we do that  if we put the resources and the focus to it  what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery  Well  first  before I even tell you the cost I've got to be absolutely clear. We do not buy people out of slavery. Buying people out of slavery is like paying a burglar to get your television back  it's abetting a crime. Liberation  however  costs some money. Liberation  and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation. It's not an event  it's a process. It's about helping people to build lives of dignity  stability  economic autonomy  citizenship. Well  amazingly  in places like India where costs are very low  that family  that three generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery    so  that granddad there  was born a baby into slavery    but the total cost  amortized across the rest of the work  was about     dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education. A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery  about     dollars. In the United States  North America  much more expensive. Legal costs  medical costs ... we understand that it's expensive here  about        dollars. But most of the people in the world in slavery live in those places where the costs are lowest. And in fact  the global average is about what it is for Ghana. And that means  when you multiply it up  the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom for the entire    million people on the planet in slavery is something like   .  billion dollars    what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels  what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system  usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans  or in the last holiday period when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people  we spent   .  billion dollars. Intel's fourth quarter earnings    .  billion. It's not a lot of money at the global level. In fact  it's peanuts. And the great thing about it is that it's not money down a hole  there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery to work for themselves  are they motivated  They take their kids out of the workplace  they build a school  they say   We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares  medicine when we're sick  clothing when we're cold.  They become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly. That's important  all of that about how we rebuild sustainable freedom  because we'd never want to repeat what happened in this country in     . Four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped. Dumped without political participation  decent education  any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives  and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination. And America is still paying the price for the botched emancipation of     . We have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch  and end up as second class citizens. It's just not going to happen. This is what liberation really looks like. Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana  reunited with their parents  and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well being so that they become slave proof    absolutely unenslaveable. Now  this woman lived in a village in Nepal. We'd been working there about a month. They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery. They'd just begun to light up a little bit  open up a little bit. But when we went to speak with her  when we took this photograph  the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back. I was frightened. We were frightened. We said to her   Are you worried  Are you upset   She said   No  because we've got hope now. How could we not succeed   she said   when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us   Okay  we have to ask ourselves  are we willing to live in a world with slavery  If we don't take action  we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy  and in our government policies. And yet  if there's one thing that every human being can agree on  I think it's that slavery should end. And if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity that we would all say is horrific  it's slavery. And we've got to say  what good is all of our intellectual and political and economic power    and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room    if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end  I think there is enough intellectual power in this room to bring slavery to an end. And you know what  If we can't do that  if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery  there is one last question  Are we truly free  Okay  thank you so much. I'm standing in front of you today in all humility  wanting to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and education. And I'm not a trained academic. Neither am I a veteran social worker. I was    years in the corporate world  trying to make organizations profitable. And then in      I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation from my kitchen table. The first thing that we did was walk through the slums. You know  by the way  there are two million people in Bangalore  who live in     slums. We couldn't go to all the slums  but we tried to cover as much as we could. We walked through these slums  identified houses where children would never go to school. We talked to the parents  tried to convince them about sending their children to school. We played with the children  and came back home really tired  exhausted  but with images of bright faces  twinkling eyes  and went to sleep. We were all excited to start  but the numbers hit us then      million children between four to    that should be going to school  but do not      million children who go to school but cannot read      million who cannot do basic maths. We also heard that     billion Indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling. Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary and administrators' salary. And yet  India has nearly the highest teacher absenteeism in the world  with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year. Those numbers were absolutely mind boggling  overwhelming  and we were constantly asked   When will you start  How many schools will you start  How many children will you get  How are you going to scale  How are you going to replicate   It was very difficult not to get scared  not to get daunted. But we dug our heels and said   We're not in the number game. We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school  sent to college  and get them prepared for better living  a high value job.  So  we started Parikrma. The first Parikrma school started in a slum where there were        people living below the poverty line. Our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums  a second story building  the only second story building inside the slums. And that rooftop did not have any ceiling  only half a tin sheet. That was our first school. One hundred sixty five children. Indian academic year begins in June. So  June it rains  so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof  waiting for the rain to stop. My God  What a bonding exercise that was. And all of us that were under that roof are still here together today. Then came the second school  the third school  the fourth school and a junior college. In six years now  we have four schools  one junior college        children coming from    slums and four orphanages. Our dream is very simple  to send each of these kids  get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully  contented in this conflict ridden chaotic globalized world. Now  when you talk global you have to talk English. And so all our schools are English medium schools. But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well. No one in their family has spoken English. No one in their generation has spoken English. But how wrong it is. Girl  I like adventurous books  and some of my favorites are Alfred Hitchcock and  unclear  and Hardy Boys. Although they are like in different contexts  one is magical  the other two are like investigation  I like those books because they have something special in them. The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing. I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book. Even if it takes me four and a half hours  or three and half hours to finish my book  I do it. Boy  I did good research and I got the information  on the  world's fastest cars. I like Ducati ZZ     because it is the fastest  the world's fastest bike  and I like Pulsar     DTSI because it is India's fastest bike.  Laughter  Shukla Bose  Well  that girl that you saw  her father sells flowers on the roadside. And this little boy has been coming to school for five years. But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world love fast bikes   Laughter  He hasn't seen one  he hasn't ridden one  of course  but he has done a lot of research through Google search. You know  when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible  the ICSE curriculum. And again  there were people who laughed at me and said   Don't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students. They'll never be able to cope.  Not only do our children cope very well  but they excel in it. You should just come across to see how well our children do. There is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school  they'd much rather put them to work. That's absolute hogwash. All parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves  but they need to believe that change is possible. Video   Hindi  SB  We have    percent attendance for all our parents teachers meeting. Sometimes it's even     percent  much more than many privileged schools. Fathers have started to attend. It's very interesting. When we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register. Now they have started writing their signature. The children have taught them. It's amazing how much children can teach. We have  a few months ago  actually late last year  we had a few mothers who came to us and said   You know  we want to learn how to read and write. Can you teach us   So  we started an afterschool for our parents  for our mothers. We had    mothers who came regularly after school to study. We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools. Ninety eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics. So  you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from. We have to send the fathers to de addiction labs and when they come back  most times sober  we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress. We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook. We have taught them nutrition  hygiene. We have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children. They do a very good job because their children are eating their food  but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect  and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile. More than    percent of our non teaching staff are all parents and extended families. We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school. Vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school. There is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream. Take a look at this little girl who was one of the    children from all privileged schools  best schools in the country that was selected for the Duke University talent identification program and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad. Video  Girl  Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA  it was such a pride for us to go to that camp. Everybody was very friendly  especially I got a lot of friends. And I felt that my English has improved a lot going there and chatting with friends. There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset  a totally different society. I mingled with almost everyone. They were very friendly. I had very good friends there  who are from Delhi  who are from Mumbai. Even now we are in touch through Facebook. After this Ahmedabad trip I've been like a totally different mingling with people and all of those. Before that I feel like I wasn't like this. I don't even mingle  or start speaking with someone so quickly. My accent with English improved a lot. And I learned football  volleyball  Frisbee  lots of games. And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here. Such beautiful food  I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful. I enjoyed eating food like  unclear  would come and ask me   Yes ma'am  what you want   It was so good to hear  SB  This girl was working as a maid before she came to school. And today she wants to be a neurologist. Our children are doing brilliantly in sports. They are really excelling. There is an inter school athletic competition that is held every year in Bangalore  where       children participate from     best schools in the city. We've got the best school award for three years successively. And our children are coming back home with bags full of medals  with lots of admirers and friends. Last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school. We also have our very own dream team. Why is this happening  Why this confidence  Is it the exposure  We have professors from MIT  Berkeley  Stanford  Indian Institute of Science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas  experiments  much beyond the classroom. Art  music are considered therapy and mediums of expression. We also believe that it's the content that is more important. It is not the infrastructure  not the toilets  not the libraries  but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important. Creating an environment of learning  of inquiry  of exploration is what is true education. When we started Parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking. We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan. But we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time  not get bogged with numbers  and actually see the child complete the circle of life  and unleash his total potential. We do not believe in scale because we believe in quality  and scale and numbers will automatically happen. We have corporates that have stood behind us  and we are able to  now  open more schools. But we began with the idea of one child at a time. This is five year old Parusharam. He was begging by a bus stop a few years ago  got picked up and is now in an orphanage  has been coming to school for the last four and a half months. He's in kindergarten. He has learned how to speak English. We have a model by which kids can speak English and understand English in three month's time. He can tell you stories in English of the thirsty crow  of the crocodile and of the giraffe. And if you ask him what he likes to do he will say   I like sleeping. I like eating. I like playing.  And if you ask him what he wants to do  he will say   I want to horsing.  Now   horsing  is going for a horse ride. So  Parusharam comes to my office every day. He comes for a tummy rub  because he believes that will give me luck.  Laughter  When I started Parikrma I began with a great deal of arrogance of transforming the world. But today I have been transformed. I have been changed with my children. I've learned so much from them  love  compassion  imagination and such creativity. Parusharam is Parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go. I promise you  Parusharam will speak in the TED conference a few years from now. Thank you.
