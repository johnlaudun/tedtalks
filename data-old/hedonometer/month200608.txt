I've been at MIT for    years. I went to TED I. There's only one other person here  I think  who did that. All the other TEDs    and I went to them all  under Ricky's regime    I talked about what the Media Lab was doing  which today has almost     people in it. And if you read the press  last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab. I didn't quit the Media Lab  I stepped down as chairman    which was a kind of ridiculous title  but someone else has taken it on    and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor. And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child  which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half  anyway. So I'm going to tell you about this  use my    minutes to tell you why we're doing it  how we're doing it and then what we're doing. And at some point I'll even pass around what the      laptop might be like. I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues  and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this. And the first is pretty obvious. It's amazing when you meet a head of state  and you say   What is your most precious natural resource   They will not say  children  at first  and then when you say   children   they will pretty quickly agree with you. And so that isn't very hard. Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems  they include education  sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education. So that's certainly part of it. And the third is a little bit less obvious. And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk  how to talk  not by being taught how to talk  or taught how to walk  but by interacting with the world  by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something  or being able to stand up and reach it. Whereas at about the age six  we were told to stop learning that way  and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching  whether it's people standing up  like I'm doing now  or a book  or something. But it was really through teaching. And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking  in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself. So with those as the principles    some of you may know Seymour Papert. This is back in       when we were working in Senegal. Because some people think that the      laptop just happened a year ago  or two years ago  or we were struck by lightning    this actually has gone back a long time  and in fact  back to the '  s. Here we're in the '  s. Steve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal. It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids  even though English wasn't their language  the Latin alphabet barely was their language  but they could just swim like fish. They could play these like pianos. A little bit more recently  I got involved personally. And these are two anecdotes    one was in Cambodia  in a village that has no electricity  no water  no television  no telephone  but has broadband Internet now. And these kids  their first English word is  Google  and they only know Skype. They've never heard of telephony. They just use Skype. And they go home at night    they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity. The parents love it  because when they open up the laptops  it's the brightest light source in the house. And talk about where metaphors and reality mix    this is the actual school. In parallel with this  Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year     . Now at the time  I think it's fair to say that    percent of the teachers were    let me say  apprehensive. Really  they were actually against it. And they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries  more schools  whatever. And now  three and a half years later  guess what  They're reporting five things  drop of truancy to almost zero  attending parent teacher meetings    which nobody did and now almost everybody does    drop in discipline problems  increase in student participation. Teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach. Kids are engaged    they have laptops     and then the fifth  which interests me the most  is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night because the teachers are getting too much email from the kids asking them for help. So when you see that kind of thing    this is not something that you have to test. The days of pilot projects are over  when people say   We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works.  Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it  and then when you figure out that this works  you can join as well. And this is what we're doing. So  One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago. It's a nonprofit association. It raised about    million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built  and then have it produced afterwards. Scale is truly important. And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price  OK  It's because you can go to a manufacturer    and I will leave the name out    but we wanted a small display  doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity. It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright. And this particular manufacturer said   We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room. We're interested in perfect color uniformity. We're interested in big displays  bright displays. You're not part of our strategic plan.  And I said   That's kind of too bad  because we need     million units a year.  And they said   Oh  well  maybe we could become part of your strategic plan.  And that's why scale counts. And that's why we will not launch this without five to    million units in the first run. And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down  and that's why I said seven to    million there. And we're doing it without a sales and marketing team. I mean  you're looking at the sales and marketing team. We will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it  and then the others can follow. We have partners. It's not hard to guess Google would be one. The others are all playing to pending. And this has been in the press a great deal. It's the so called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia. Now once people start looking at this  they say   Ah  this is a laptop project.  Well  no  it's not a laptop project. It's an education project. And the fun part    and I'm quite focused on it    I tell people I used to be a light bulb  but now I'm a laser    I'm just going to get that thing built  and it turns out it's not so hard. Because laptop economics are the following  I say    percent here    it's more like        percent of the cost of your laptop is sales  marketing  distribution and profit. Now we have none of those  OK  None of those figure into our cost  because first of all  we sell it at cost  and the governments distribute it. It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook. So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else. Now the display on your laptop costs  in rough numbers     dollars a diagonal inch. That can drop to eight  it can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two  or to one and a half  unless we do some pretty clever things. It's the rest    that little brown box    that is pretty fascinating  because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself. It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity. And we have a situation today which is incredible. I've been using laptops since their inception. And my laptop runs slower  less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before. And this year is worse. People clap  sometimes you even get standing ovations  and I say   What the hell's wrong with you  Why are we all sitting there   And somebody    to remain nameless    called our laptop a  gadget  recently. And I said   God  our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell. When you open it up  it's going to go 'bing.'  It'll be on. It'll be just like it was in       when you bought an Apple Macintosh    . It worked really well. And we've been going steadily downhill. Now  people ask all the time what it is. That's what it is. The two pieces that are probably notable  it'll be a mesh network  so when the kids open up their laptops  they all become a network  and then just need one or two points of backhaul. You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits. So you really can bring into a village  and then the villages can connect themselves  and you really can do it quite well. The dual mode display    the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors    isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight  Well  you can't see it. And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time  most cell phones. Now  what we're doing is  we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit. And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen. But when it's backlit  it's color. And when it's frontlit  it's black and white at three times the resolution. Is it all worked out  No. That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now. And in about    days  we'll know for sure whether this works. Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance. And this is again something that people don't believe  but I really think it's quite true. That's the machine we showed in Tunis. This is more the direction that we're going to go. And it's something that we didn't think was possible. Now  I'm going to pass this around. This isn't a design  OK  So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. And it's clearly just a model. The working one is at MIT. I'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman. At least you can decide whether it goes left or    Chris Anderson  Before you do it  for the people down in simulcast    Nicholas Negroponte  Sorry  I forgot. CA  Just show it off a bit. So wherever the camera is    OK  good point. Thank you  Chris. The idea was that it would be not only a laptop  but that it could transform into an electronic book. So it's sort of an electronic book. This is where when you go outside  it's in black and white. The games buttons are missing  but it'll also be a games machine  book machine. Set it up this way  and it's a television set. Etc.  etc.    is that enough for simulcast  OK  sorry. I'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards. OK. Seven countries. I say  maybe  for Massachusetts  because they actually have to do a bid. By law you've got to bid  and so on and so forth. So I can't quite name them. In the other cases  they don't have to do bids. They can decide    it's the federal government in each case. It's kind of agonizing  because a lot of people say   Let's do it at the state level   because states are more nimble than the feds  just because of size. And yet we count. We're really dealing with the federal government. We're really dealing with ministries of education. And if you look at governments around the world  ministries of education tend to be the most conservative  and also the ones that have huge payrolls. Everybody thinks they know about education  a lot of culture is built into it as well. It's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road. If you look at the countries  they're pretty geoculturally distributed. Have they all agreed  No  not completely. Probably Thailand  Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed. We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months  I'm just going around the world every three weeks. Here's sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting. Everybody says it's a      laptop    you can't do it. Well  guess what  we're not. We're coming in probably at      to start  then drift down. And that's very important  because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up. It's kind of the loss leader  and then as soon as it looks interesting  it can't be afforded  or it can't be scaled out. So we're targeting    dollars in     . The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways    just one    but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique    It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles    thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States. Not one single post office truck is stolen. And why  Because there's no market for post office trucks. It looks like a post office truck. You can spray paint it. You can do anything you want. I just learned recently  in South Africa  no white Volvos are stolen. Period. None. Zero. So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo. Each government has a task force. This perhaps is less interesting  but we're trying to get the governments to all work together and it's not easy. The economics of this is to start with the federal governments and then later  to subsequently go to other    whether it's child to child funding  so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world  maybe of the same gender  maybe of the same age. An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present. I mean  there are all sorts of things that will happen  and they'll be very  very exciting. And everybody says    I say    it's an education project. Are we providing the software  The answer is  The system certainly has software  but no  we're not providing the education content. That is really done in the countries. But we are certainly constructionists. And we certainly believe in learning by doing and everything from Logo  which was started in       to more modern things  like Scratch  if you've ever even heard of it  are very  very much part of it. And that's the rollout. Are we dreaming  Is this real  It actually is real. The only criticism  and people really don't want to criticize this  because it is a humanitarian effort  a nonprofit effort and to criticize it is a little bit stupid  actually. But the one thing that people could criticize was   Great idea  but these guys can't do it.  And that could either mean these guys  professors and so on couldn't do it  or that it's not possible. Well  on December     a company called Quanta agreed to build it  and since they make about one third of all the laptops on the planet today  that question disappeared. So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen. It is going to happen. And if it comes out at     dollars  so what  If it comes out six months late  so what  That's a pretty soft landing. Thank you. I'm really excited to be here today. I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab  literally  and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to see it in person  because I really think this is going to really change the way we interact with machines from this point on. Now  this is a rear projected drafting table. It's about    inches wide and it's equipped with a multi touch sensor. Normal touch sensors that you see  like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards  can only register one point of contact at a time. This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time. They can use both my hands  I can use chording actions  I can just go right up and use all    fingers if I wanted to. You know  like that. Now  multi touch sensing isn't completely new. People like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '  s. However  the approach I built here is actually high resolution  low cost  and probably most importantly  very scalable. So  the technology  you know  isn't the most exciting thing here right now  other than probably its newfound accessibility. What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it. So let's see. So  for instance  we have a lava lamp application here. Now  you can see  I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together. I can inject heat into the system here  or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers. It's completely intuitive  there's no instruction manual. The interface just kind of disappears. This started out as a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students in our lab  Ilya Rosenberg  made. But I think its true identity comes out here. Now what's great about a multi touch sensor is that  you know  I could be doing this with as many fingers here  but of course multi touch also inherently means multi user. Chris could be interacting with another part of Lava  while I play around with it here. You can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool  where I'm kind of warming something up  making it malleable  and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state. Google should have something like this in their lobby. I'll show you a little more of a concrete example here  as this thing loads. This is a photographer's light box application. Again  I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around. But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers  I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily. I can pan  zoom and rotate it effortlessly. I can do that grossly with both of my hands  or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together. If I grab the canvas  I can do the same thing    stretch it out. I can do it simultaneously  holding this down  and gripping on another one  stretching this out. Again  the interface just disappears here. There's no manual. This is exactly what you expect  especially if you haven't interacted with a computer before. Now  when you have initiatives like the      laptop  I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new generation to computing with this standard mouse and windows pointer interface. This is something that I think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from now on. Now  of course  I can bring up a keyboard. And I can bring that around  put that up there. Obviously  this is a standard keyboard  but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands. That's really important  because there's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming to a physical device. That leads to bad things  like RSI. We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us. There's so little applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces from this point on. This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go. You can imagine  in the future  as we develop this kind of technology  a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away  and really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke. So    again  isn't this great  Audience  Where's your lab  Jeff Han  I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York. Here's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls. It'll remember the strokes I'm making. Of course I can do it with all my hands. It's pressure sensitive. What's neat about that is  I showed that two finger gesture that zooms in really quickly. Because you don't have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool  you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales  all at the same time. I can create big things out here  but I can go back and really quickly go back to where I started  and make even smaller things here. This is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization. For instance  I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk  and he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time  We have all this great data  but for some reason  it's just sitting there. We're not accessing it. And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools  but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces  to be able to drill down into this kind of data  while still thinking about the big picture here. Let me show you another app here. This is called WorldWind. It's done by NASA. We've all seen Google Earth  this is an open source version of that. There are plug ins to be able to load in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years. As you can see  I can use the same two fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface  again. It really allows anybody to kind of go in    and it just does what you'd expect  you know  Again  there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears. I can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here. NASA's really cool. These hyper spectral images are false colored so you can    it's really good for determining vegetative use. Well  let's go back to this. The great thing about mapping applications    it's not really  D  it's  D. So  again  with a multi point interface  you can do a gesture like this    so you can be able to tilt around like that    It's not just simply relegated to a kind of  D panning and motion. This gesture is just putting two fingers down    it's defining an axis of tilt    and I can tilt up and down that way. We just came up with that on the spot  it's probably not the right thing to do  but there's such interesting things you can do with this interface. It's just so much fun playing around with it  too. And so the last thing I want to show you is    I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this. Now  here's a simple application here    I can draw out a curve. And when I close it  it becomes a character. But the neat thing about it is I can add control points. And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time. And you notice what it does. It's kind of a puppeteering thing  where I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make    Now  there's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing. This technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here  with multiple control points  is actually state of the art. It was released at SIGGRAPH last year. It's a great example of the kind of research I really love  all this compute power to make things do the right things  intuitive things  to do exactly what you expect. So  multi touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI. I'm not the only one doing it  a lot of other people are getting into it. This kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it  I'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields. Thank you. Hi  everyone. I'm Sirena. I'm    years old and from Connecticut. Well  I'm not really sure why I'm here. I mean  what does this have to do with technology  entertainment and design  Well  I count my iPod  cellphone and computer as technology  but this has nothing to do with that. So I did a little research on it. Well  this is what I found. Of course  I hope I can memorize it. The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings. By pulling a string  it vibrates and produces a sound wave  which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge  and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified  but ... let me think. Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length  and that changes the frequency of the sound wave. OK  this is sort of technology  but I can call it a   th century technology. But actually  the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound. Isn't that cool  Design    I love its design. I remember when I was little  my mom asked me   Would you like to play the violin or the piano   I looked at that giant monster and said to myself     I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day   This is small and lightweight. I can play from standing  sitting or walking. And  you know what  The best of all is that if I don't want to practice  The violin is very beautiful. Some people relate it as the shape of a lady. But whether you like it or not  it's been so for more than     years  unlike modern stuff  that  easily looks dated. But I think it's very personal and unique that  although each violin looks pretty similar  no two violins sound the same    even from the same maker or based on the same model. Entertainment    I love the entertainment. But actually  the instrument itself isn't very entertaining. I mean  when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it  it was actually really bad  because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids    it was so horrible and so scratchy. So  it wasn't entertaining at all. But besides  my brother found this very funny  Yuk  Yuk  Yuk  A few years later  I heard a joke about the greatest violinist  Jascha Heifetz. After Mr. Heifetz's concert  a lady came over and complimented him   Oh  Mr. Heifetz  your violin sounded so great tonight   And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person  so he picked up his violin and said   Funny    I don't hear anything.  Now I realize that as the musician  we human beings  with our great mind  artistic heart and skill  can change this   th century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. Now I know why I'm here. At first  I thought I was just going to be here to perform  but unexpectedly  I learned and enjoyed much more. But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me. Like the multi dimension stuff. I mean  honestly  I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school. But actually  the most impressive thing to me is that    well  actually  I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults  for actually caring for us a lot  and to make our future world much better. Thank you. Thank you  Thank you very much. Like the speaker before me    I am a TED virgin  I guess. I'm also the first time here  and ... I don't know what to say  I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me. I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone. And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann. It's called  Kaleidoscope.  And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late   th century  and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time. I have another piece that I'd like to play for you. It's called  Abegg Variations   by Robert Schumann  a German   th century composer. The name  Abegg  is actually A B E G G  and that's the main theme in the melody. That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends. But he wrote that for his wife. So actually  if you listen carefully  there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme. It's written around       so even though it's old  I hope you'll like it. Now comes the part that I hate. Well  because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called  Sync and Flow   I was wondering   What do I know that these geniuses don't   So  I'll talk about musical composition  even though I don't know where to start. How do I compose  I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose. What I do first is  I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano    and I choose one of those to become my main theme  my main melody  like the Abegg that you just heard. And once I choose my main theme  I have to decide  Out of all the styles in music  what kind of style do I want  And this year  I composed a Romantic style. So for inspiration  I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers. Next  I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers. They help me plan out the whole piece. And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas  because then you have to think. And then  when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form    solidified  excuse me    solidified form  you're supposed to actually polish the piece  polish the details  and then polish the overall performance of the composition. And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing. Drawing  because I like to draw  you know  Japanese anime art. I think that's a craze among teens right now. And once I realized it  there's a parallel between creating music and creating art  because for your motive  or your little initial idea for your drawing  it's your character    you want to decide who you want to draw  or if you want to draw an original character. And then you want to decide  How are you going to draw the character  Like  am I going to use one page  Am I going to draw it on the computer  Am I going to use a two page spread like a comic book  For a more grandiose effect  I guess. And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character  which is like your structure of a piece  and then you add pen and pencil  and whatever details that you need    that's polishing the drawing. And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind  because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted. So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it  I'll try to draw or  you know  waste my time. And then what happens is  sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all  and then it's like there's too much on your mind. You can't focus on what you're supposed to do. And sometimes  if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it  you'll get something out of it  but it doesn't come naturally. What happens is  if something magical happens  if something natural happens to you  you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly  and then that's what I consider  flow   because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything. You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want. I'm not going to play my own composition today because  although I did finish it  it's way too long. Instead  I'd like to try something called  improvisation.  I have here seven note cards  one with each note of the musical alphabet. And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five    anyone to come up here and choose five    and then I can make it into some sort of melody  and I'll improvise it. Wow. A volunteer  yay  Jennifer Lin  Nice to meet you. Goldie Hawn  Thank you. Choose five  JL  Yes  five cards. Any five cards. GH  OK  one. JL  OK. GH  Two. JL  Yes. GH  Three. GH  Oh  D and F    too familiar. JL  One more. GH  OK.  E  for  effort.  JL  Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them  GH  OK    C  G  B  A and E. JL  Thank you very much  GH  You're welcome. And what about these  JL  I won't use them. Thank you  Now  she chose C  G  B  A  E. I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order. OK  that's nice. So  I'm going to have a moment to think  and I'll try to make something out of it. The next song  or the encore that I'm going to play is called  Bumble Boogie   by Jack Fina. In terms of invention  I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects. I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on  but I think it's also the simplest. It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet  the number one cause of death in children under five. Which is ...  Water borne diseases  Diarrhea  Malnutrition  No. It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires    acute respiratory infections caused by this. Can you believe that  I find this shocking and somewhat appalling. Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels  Can't we make better stoves  How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year  I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes  so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro tubes  which is charcoal. So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now    percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this all over the island. It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation. A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths    that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil. So the rains come    they go down the rivers and the flooding happens. Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this  people need to cook  and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage. They know perfectly well  but they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available  and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree  cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly  there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels. About four years ago  I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked. And the idea was that you could take waste paper  you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes  they were able to triple the throughput of this device. So you could imagine they were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them. And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little discouraging to the students. And in fact  if you look closely  right here you can see it says   US Peace Corps.  As it turns out  there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village  it was     kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel. What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called  bagasse.  It has no other use. It has no nutritional value  so they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with  something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years  students and I worked to develop a process. So you start with the bagasse  and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five gallon oil drum. After some time  after setting it on fire  you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln  and then you end up with this carbonized material here. However  you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently  one of my students was from Ghana  and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called  kokonte   which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked  and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti  under the name of  manioc.  In fact  it's grown all over the world    yucca  tapioca  manioc  cassava  it's all the same thing    a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick  sticky porridge out of it  which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon  or Charcoal Institute. And these    That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made. Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti  this produces really smoky fires  and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel. Kids and women are especially affected by it  because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires. So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal making technology there. Well  unfortunately  they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava  but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure  which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side by side tests  and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel. And in fact  it heats the water a lot more quickly. And so we were very happy  thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side by side comparisons with wood charcoal  it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. So we went back to MIT  we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it  And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this  we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process  to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there. And after some time  we developed a low cost press that allows you to produce charcoal  which actually now burns not only    actually  it burns longer  cleaner than wood charcoal. So now we're in a situation where we have a product  which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace  which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone  about    million trees are cut down every year. There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition  the revenue generated from that charcoal is     million dollars. That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti    with a population of eight million and an average income of less than     dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project. And one of the things that I think is also interesting  is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide  you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable  but up until now  there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel. One of the really exciting things  though  is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing  and it's even lower tech than what you just saw  if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this  This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes    it comes ready made. This is my      laptop  right here. And actually  like Nick  I brought samples. So we can pass these around. They're fully functional  field tested  ready to roll out. And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology  is that the technology transfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal  where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder  this comes pre briquetted. And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now  which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life. But once you see it  like you guys in the front row    All right  yeah  OK. So anyway    Here it is. And this is  I think  a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non zero sum things. So not only do you have health benefits  you have environmental benefits. But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare that you don't have trade offs between health and economics  or environment and economics. So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us. So when we talk about  now  the future we will create  one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in. And now  I don't actually mean the world that we live in. I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand  and where  when you work    hours a day  you're still only earning    dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend    billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water. It's a place where  for example  if this were India  in this room  only three of us would have a car. If this were Afghanistan  only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia        of you would be farmers      of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers  our designers  our business people  our entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions that we need to find. I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro finance and micro enterprise  so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out    and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making  poultry rearing  etc. But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale. The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink our development strategies  so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers  but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think about how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future  and we need to start doing it now. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you  incredible. Stay here. Tell us    just while we see if someone has a question    just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on. Amy Smith  Some of the other things we're working on are ways to do low cost water quality testing  so that communities can maintain their own water systems  know when they're working  know when they treat them  etc. We're also looking at low cost water treatment systems. One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that. CA  What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale  Do you need to find entrepreneurs  or venture capitalists  or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale  AS  I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing    it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward. And we're a pretty small staff  which is me. So  you know  I do what I can with the students. We have    students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward. The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame  as  you know  you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years  you have to be looking five or    years ahead. But I think with the vision to do that  we can move forward. My name is Lovegrove. I only know nine Lovegroves  two of which are my parents. They are first cousins  and you know what happens when  you know    So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me  which I'm fighting with all the time. So to try and get through today  I've kind of disciplined myself with an    minute talk. I was hanging on to have a pee. I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough  that would guide me through the    minutes. OK. I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position. But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people's soul and emotion. Not very long ago  not many thousands of years ago  we actually lived in caves  and I don't think we've lost that coding system. We respond so well to form. But I'm interested in creating intelligent form. I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design. This artificially induced consumerism    I think it's atrocious. My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins  Janine Benyus  James Watson. I'm in that world  but I work purely instinctively. I'm not a scientist. I could have been  perhaps  but I work in this world where I trust my instincts. So I am a   st century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with. And we should be developing things    we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use. So  the water bottle. I'll begin with this concept of what I call DNA. DNA  Design  Nature  Art. These are the three things that condition my world. Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci      years ago  before photography. It shows how observation  curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art. Industrial design is the art form of the   st century. People like Leonardo    there have not been many    had this amazingly instinctive curiosity. I work from a similar position. I don't want to sound pretentious saying that  but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago    well into the   st century      years later. It's my impression of water. Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it      million dollars  easily  for a Monet. I use  now  a whole new process. A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn  Thom Mayne  Zaha Hadid  Rem Koolhaas    all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form. This is all created digitally. Here you see the machining  the milling of a block of acrylic. This is what I show to the client to say   That's what I want to do.  At that point  I don't know if that's possible at all. It's a seductor  but I just feel in my bones that that's possible. So we go  we look at the tooling. We look at how that is produced. These are the invisible things that you never see in your life. This is the background noise of industrial design. That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra. It is more valuable than the product in my eyes. I don't have one. When I do make some money  I'll have one machined for myself. This is the final product. When they sent it to me  I thought I'd failed. It felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing. It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself. It's an icon of water itself  and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design. Each bottle is different  meaning the water level will give you a different shape. It's mass individualism from a single product. It fits the hand. It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands. It makes the product strong  the tessellation. It's a millefiori of ideas. In the future  they will look like that  because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things  perhaps  in life. Biopolymers  these new ideas for materials  will come into play in probably a decade. It doesn't look as cool  does it  But I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that. I design for that condition  biopolymers. It's the future. I took this video in Cape Town last year. This is the freaky side coming out. I have this special interest in things like this  which blow my mind. I don't know whether to  you know  drop to my knees  cry  I don't know what I think. But I just know that nature    nature improves with ever greater purpose that which once existed  and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking. When I look at these things  they look pretty normal to me. But these things evolved over many years  and what we're trying to do    I get three weeks to design a telephone. How the hell do I do that  when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve  How do you condense that  It comes back to instinct. I'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that and I'm not looking at designing architecture like that. I'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates. How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand. This is a scan through the human forearm. It's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure. I have these in my office. My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab. It's a weird  kind of freaky place. This is one of my specimens. This is made    bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers. I studied cooking in school for four years  and in that experience  which was called  domestic science   it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification. Actually  I put marijuana in everything I cooked    And I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous. All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand. Anyway    this is a meringue. This is another sample I have. A meringue is made exactly the same way  in my estimation  as a bone. It's made from polysaccharides and proteins. If you pour water on that  it dissolves. Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future  Not a bad idea. I don't know. I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that  but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something  a car    I don't know. I'm also interested in growth patterns  the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all. These interrelated forms  they do inspire everything I do  although I might end up making something incredibly simple. This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium. It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of  kind of  engineering and biological thinking  shown pretty much as a bone structure. Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object. It's the world's first chair made in magnesium. It cost  .  million dollars to develop. It's called  Go   by Bernhardt  USA. It went into Time magazine in      as the new language of the   st century. Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village  that's enough. It shows how you make one holistic form  like the car industry  and then you break up what you need. This is an absolutely beautiful way of working. It's a godly way of working. It's organic and it's essential. It's an absolutely fat free design  and when you look at it  you see human beings. When that moves into polymers  you can change the elasticity  the fluidity of the form. This is an idea for a gas injected  one piece polymer chair. What nature does is it drills holes in things. It liberates form. It takes away anything extraneous. That's what I do. I make organic things which are essential. And they look funky  too    but I don't set out to make funky things because I think that's an absolute disgrace. I set out to look at natural forms. If you took the idea of fractal technology further  take a membrane  shrinking it down constantly like nature does    that could be a seat for a chair. It could be a sole for a sports shoe. It could be a car blending into seats. Wow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff. This is what exists in nature. Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day. That's what I do. This is a show that's currently on in Tokyo. It's called  Superliquidity.  It's my sculptural investigation. It's like   st century Henry Moore. When you see a Henry Moore  still  your hair stands up. There's some amazing spiritual connect. If he was a car designer  phew  we'd all be driving one. In his day  he was the highest taxpayer in Britain. That is the power of organic design. It contributes immensely to our    sense of being  our sense of relationships with things  our sensuality and  you know  the sort of    even the sort of socio erotic side  which is very important. This is my artwork. This is all my process. These actually are sold as artwork. They're very big prints. But this is how I get to that object. Ironically  that object was made by the Killarney process  which is a brand new process here for the   st century  and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that. I'll tell you about that later. When I look into these data images  I see new things. It's self inspired. Diatomic structures  radiolaria  the things that we couldn't see but we can do now    these  again  are cored out. They're made virtually from nothing. They're made from silica. Why not structures from cars like that  Coral  all these natural forces  take away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty. We need to be in that realm. I want to do stuff like that. This is a new chair which should come on the market in September. It's for a company called Moroso in Italy. It's a gas injected polymer chair. Those holes you see there are very filtered down  watered down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures. It goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see    there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing. It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming. If you see the shadows that come through that  they're actually probably more important than the product  but it's the minimum it takes. The coring out of the back lets you breathe. It takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too. I was going to break into a dance then. This is some current work I'm doing. I'm looking at single surface structures and how they stretch and flow. It's based on furniture typologies  but that's not the end motivation. It's made from aluminum ... as opposed to aluminium  and it's grown. It's grown in my mind  and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through. This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry  who build parts for Bentleys and so on. It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York. I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers. When I see these animations  oh Jesus  I'm blown away. This is what goes on in my studio everyday. I walk    I'm traveling. I come back. Some guy's got that on a computer    there's this like  oh my goodness. So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio. This kind of effervescent    fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas. Single surface products. Furniture's a good one. How you grow legs out of a surface. I would love to build this one day and perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour  sugar  polymer  wood chips    I don't know  human hair. I don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time. That's the weird side coming out again. A lot of companies don't understand that. Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo. They said   Give us the dream. What is our dream  How do we beat Apple   I said   You don't copy Apple  that's for sure. You get into biopolymers.  They looked straight through me. What a waste. Anyway. No  it's true. Fuck them. You know  I mean    I'm delivering  they're not taking. I've had this image    years. I've had this image of a water droplet for    years  sitting on a hot bed. That is an image of a car for me. That's the car of the future. It's a water droplet. I've been banging on about this like I can't believe. Cars are all wrong. I'm going to show you something a bit weird now. They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this. The only place that didn't laugh was Moscow. Cars are made from        components. How ridiculous is that  Couldn't you make that from      It's got a vacuum formed  carbon nylon pan. Everything's holistically integrated. It opens and closes like a bread bin. There is no engine. There's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels  they're fitted like Formula  . You take them off your wall  you plug them in. Off you go. A three wheeled car  slow  feminine  transparent  so you can see the people in there. You drive different. You see that thing. You do. You do. And not anesthetized  separated from life. There's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that. It's a city car. You drive along. You get out. You drive on to a proboscis. You get out. It lifts you up. It presents the solar panel to the sun  and at night  it's a street lamp. That's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first  and do the car second. I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages  floating around on the ground  driven by AI. When I showed this in South Africa  everybody afterwards was going   Hey  car on a stick. Like this.  Can you imagine  A car on a stick. If you put it next to contemporary architecture  it feels totally natural to me. And that's what I do with my furniture. I'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore. I'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture. I'm trying to build transportation systems. I work on aircraft for Airbus  I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural  inspired by nature dreams home. I'm going to finish on two things. This is the stereolithography of a staircase. It's a little bit of a dedication to James  James Watson. I built this thing for my studio. It cost me         dollars to build this. Most people go and buy the Aston Martin. I built this. This is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex. Took about two years  because I'm looking for fat free design. Lean  efficient things. Healthy products. This is built by composites. It's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element  and this is a carbon fiber handrail which is only supported in two places. Modern materials allow us to do modern things. This is a shot in the studio. This is how it looks pretty much every day. You wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it. There is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards. Who cares  And it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength. It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean. It's in Notting Hill  next to all the crap    the prostitutes and all that stuff. It's next to David Hockney's original studio. It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day. My guys go out for lunch. The door's open. They come back in  because it's normally raining and they prefer to stay in. This is my studio. Elephant skull from Oxford University      . I bought that last year. They're very difficult to find. If anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me  I'll put it in the studio. So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video. It's a homemade video  made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that. You never see architects or designers showing you their real world. This is called a  Plasnet.  It's a new bio polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy. World's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars. We should all be riding one of these. As China buys all these crappy cars  we should be riding things like this. Counterbalance. Like I say  it's a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory. It's full of prototypes and objects. It's self inspirational  again. I mean  the rare times when I'm there  I do enjoy it. And I get lots and lots of kids coming. I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers    wankers. Sorry. That's a solar seed. It's a concept for new architecture. That thing on the top is the world's first solar powered garden lamp    the first produced. Giles Revell should be talking here today    amazing photography of things you can't see. The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo. Lots of stuff. There's a little leaf chair    that golden looking thing is called  Leaf.  It's made from Kevlar. On the wall is my book called  Supernatural   which allows me to remember what I've done  because I forget. There's an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year  in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture. Gernot Oberfell  working at three o'clock in the morning    and I don't pay overtime. Overtime is the passion of design  so join the club or don't. No  it's true. People like Tom and Greg    we're traveling like you can't    we fit it all in. I don't know how we do it. Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden  then I'm in Beijing on Friday. You work that one out. And when I see Ed's photographs  I think  why the hell am I going to China  It's true. It's true. Because there's a soul in this whole thing. We need to have a new instinct for the   st century. We need to combine all this stuff. If all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together  it would be a joy  absolute joy. So there's a new X light system I'm doing in Japan. There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa. There's a Kifwebe mask. These are my sculptures. A copper jelly mold. It sounds like some quiz show or something  doesn't it  So  it's going to end. Thank you  James  for your great inspiration. Thank you very much. I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days. So many different points of resonance that it's going to be difficult to bring them all up  but I'll try to do my best. Does anybody remember these  OK  so these are LP records and they've been replaced  right  They've been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world flattening digitization technologies  right  And I think it was best witnessed when Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today. What's happened in the music world is there's a culture  or an ecosystem that's been created that  if you take some words from Apple  the catchphrase    that we create  rip  mix and burn. What I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas. Anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas  use them in innovative ways. Anyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways  draw connections between musical ideas  and people can burn them or create final products and continue the circle. And what that's done is it's created  like I said  a vibrant community that's very inclusive  with people continually working to connect musical ideas  innovate them and keep things constantly up to date. Today's hit single is not last year's hit single. But I'm not here to talk about music today. I'm here to talk about books. In particular  textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school. Has anyone here ever been to school  OK  does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools  around the world  I'm not going to spend too much time on that  but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book. That in fact  the publishing process    just because of the fact that it's complicated  it's heavy  books are expensive    creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books  be they teachers  students or just general readers. And this is even more true if you happen to speak a language other than one of the world's major languages  and especially English. I'm going to call these people below the barrier  shutouts  because they're really shut out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world. And so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books  using them and teaching from them. So  that's what I'd like to talk about and  really  how we get from where we are now to where we need to go. The first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment. Imagine taking all the world's books. OK  everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages. So  liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast  interconnected  global repository. Think of it as a massive iTunes for book type content. And then take that material and imagine making it all open  so that people can modify it  play with it  improve it. Imagine making it free  so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge  and imagine using information technology so that you can update this content  improve it  play with it  on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years. Instead of editions of a book coming out every two years  imagine them coming out every    seconds. So  imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this. So that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors  but all the people who could be or want to be authors in all the different languages of the world  and I think if you could do this  it would be called    I'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem. So  really  this is the dream  and in a sense what you can think of it is we're trying to enable anyone in the world  I mean anyone in the world    to be their own educational DJ  creating educational materials  sharing them with the world  constantly innovating on them. So  this is the dream. In fact  this dream is actually being realized. Over the last six and a half years  we've been working really hard at Rice University on a project called Connexions  and so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk is just tell you a little bit about what people are doing with Connexions  which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday  where they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world. We're working on the open source tools and the content. So  that's sort of to put it in perspective here. So  create. What are some of the people that are using these kind of tools  Well  the first thing is  there's a community of engineering professors  from Cambridge to Kyoto  who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive  super textbook that covers the entire area of electrical engineering. And not only that    it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions. If people like Kitty Jones  a shut out    a private music teacher and mom from Champagne  Illinois  who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world  on how to teach kids how to play music    Her material is now used over         times per month. Tremendous use. In fact  a lot of this use coming from United States K    schools  because anyone who's involved in a school scale back  the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum. And so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open  free content. A lot of teachers are using this stuff. What about ripping  What about copying  reusing  A team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso    graduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas. And within about a week  having this be some of our most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America  and in particular in Mexico  because of the open  extensible nature of this. People  volunteers and even companies that are translating materials into Asian languages like Chinese  Japanese and Thai  to spread the knowledge even further. OK  what about people who are mixing  What does  mixing  mean   Mixing  means building customized courses  means building customized books. Companies like National Instruments  who are embedding very powerful  interactive simulations into the materials  so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do. We've been working with Teachers Without Borders  who are very interested in mixing our materials. They're going to be using Connexions as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach in    countries around the world. TWB is currently in Iraq  training        teachers supported by USAID. And to them  this idea of being able to remix and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important  because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism    that if you don't empower people with the ability to re contextualize the material  translate it into their own language and take ownership of it  it's not good. OK  other organizations we've been working with  UC Merced    people know about UC Merced. It's a new university in California  in the Central Valley  working very closely with community colleges. They're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system. And they're also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open source. We've been working with AMD  which has a project called   x    which is trying to bring Internet connectivity to    percent of the world's population by     . We're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages. And we've also been working with a number of other organizations. In particular  a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation  who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content. OK  burn    I think this is  sort of  quite interesting.  Burn  is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses. And I think a lot of you received    I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack. A little present for you. Just to tell you quickly about it  this is an engineering textbook. It's about     pages long  hardbound. This costs    anybody guess  How much would it cost in a bookstore  Richard Baraniuk  OK. This costs    dollars to the student. Why does it cost    dollars  Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials. If this book were to be published by a regular publisher  it would cost at least     dollars. So what we're seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular  sort of single authored book towards community authored materials that are modular  that are customized to each individual class and published on demand very inexpensively  either pushed out through Amazon or published directly through an on demand press  like QOOP. And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing. We're not talking about the Harry Potter end  right at the left side. We're talking about books on hypergeometric partial differential equations. Books that might sell     copies a year        copies a year. There is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours  but also to sustain this new emergence of on demand publishers  like QOOP  who produced these two books. And I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk is that there's an impending cut out the middle man disintermediation  that's going to be happening in the publishing industry. And it's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years  and I think that it's for our benefit  really  and for the world's benefit. OK  so what are the enablers  What's really making all of this happen  There's tons of technology  and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML. How many people know about XML  Oh  great. So it's the future of the web  right  It's semantic representation of content. And what you can really think of XML in this case is it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages. Remember we took the book  tore the pages out  Well  what the XML is going to do is it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks. XML are the nubs on the Lego that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways  and it provides us a framework to share content. So  it lets you take this ecosystem in its primordial state of all this content  all the pages you've torn out of books  and create highly sophisticated learning machines  books  courses  course packs. It gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student  so that every student can have a book or a course that's customized to their learning style  their context  their language and the things that excite them. It lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways  and surprising new ways. It lets you interconnect ideas  indicating how fields relate to each other. And I'll just give you my personal story. We came up with this six and a half years ago because I teach the stuff in the red box. And my day job  as Chris said    I'm an electrical engineering professor. I teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math    Wow  about half of you have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation. But this seemingly dry math is actually the center of this tremendously powerful web that links technology    that links really cool applications like music synthesizers to tremendous economic opportunities  but also governed by intellectual property. And the thing that I realized is there was no way that I  as an engineer  could write this book that would get all of this across. We needed a community to do it and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas. And I think that really  in a sense  what we're trying to do is make Minsky's dream come to a reality  where you can imagine all the books in a library actually starting to talk to each other. And people who are teachers out here    whoever taught  you know this    it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about. OK  back to math. Imagine    this is possible  that every single equation that you click on in one of your new e texts is something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with. So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade. You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it  tinker with it  understand it. Because we really don't understand until we do. The same type of mark up  like MathML  for chemistry. Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed. Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music  play with it  understand it. It's no wonder that everybody's getting into it  right  Even the three wise men. OK  the second big enabler  and this is where I told a big lie. The second big enabler is intellectual property. Because  in fact  I got up here and I talked about how great the music culture is. We can share and rip  mix and burn  but in fact  that's all illegal. And we would be accused of  piracy  for doing that  because this music has been propertized. It's now owned  much of it by big industries. So  really  the key thing here is we can't let this happen. We can't let this Napster thing happen here. So  what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning. And what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable. And the inspiration here is taken from open source software. Things like Linux and the GPL. The Creative Commons licenses. How many people have heard of creative commons  If you have not  you must learn about it. Creativecommons.org. At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects  you can find their logo. Clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no nonsense  human readable document  a deed  that tells you exactly what you can do with this content. In fact  you're free to share it  to do all of these things  to copy it  to change it  even to make commercial use of it  as long as you attribute the author. Because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing  it's really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact. That's why people write  not necessarily making bucks. We're not talking about Harry Potter  right  We're at the long tail end here. Behind that is the legal code  very carefully constructed. And Creative Commons is taking off    over    million things out there  licensed with a Creative Commons license. Not just text  but music  images  video. And there's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re sampling  ripping  mixing  burning and sharing. OK  I'd like to conclude with just the last few points. So  we've built this idea of a commons. People are using it. We get over         unique visitors per month  just to our particular site. MIT OpenCourseWare  which is another large open content site  gets a similar number of hits. But how do we protect this  How do we protect it into the future  And the first thing that people are probably thinking is quality control  right  Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons. Anybody can contribute anything. So that could be a problem. It didn't take long until people started contributing materials  for example  on lingerie  which is actually a pretty good module. The only problem is it's plagiarized from a major French feminist journal  and when you go to the supposed course website  it points to a lingerie selling website. So this is a little bit of a problem. So we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in. You come to TED. Why do you come to TED  Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are very  very high quality  right  And so we need to be able to do the same thing. And we need to be able to design structures  and what we're doing is designing social software to enable anyone to build their own peer review process  and we call these things  lenses.  And basically what they allow is anyone out there can develop their own peer review process  so that they can focus on the content in the repository that they think is really important. And you can think of TED as a potential lens. So I'd just like to end by saying  you can really view this as a call to action. Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge. All of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge  and what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other projects of its type  because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing. So  thanks very much. Charles Van Doren  who was later a senior editor of Britannica  said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical    it should stop being safe. But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since       it was anything but radical  still a very completely safe  stodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia  on the other hand  begins with a very radical idea  and that's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia    you just saw the little demonstration of it    it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many  many languages. It's written using wiki software    which is the type of software he just demonstrated    so anyone can quickly edit and save  and it goes live on the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization  he's exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside. So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation  which I founded  a nonprofit organization. And our goal  the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation  is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. And so  if you think about what that means  it means a lot more than just building a cool website. We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide  poverty worldwide  empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model  because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to    they can take our content and do anything they like with it    you can copy it  redistribute it    and you can do it commercially or non commercially. So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We're funded by donations from the public  and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is. But first  I'll show you how big it is. So we've got over         articles in English. We've got two million total articles across many  many different languages. The biggest languages are German  Japanese  French    all the Western European languages are quite big. But only around one third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia  which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very English centric way on the Internet  but for us  we're truly global. We're in many  many languages. How popular we've gotten to be    we're a top    website and we're more popular than the New York Times. So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion. This shows the growth of Wikipedia    we're the blue line there    and this is the New York Times over there. And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge  enormous corporate operation with I have no idea how many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee  and that employee is our lead software developer. And he's only been our employee since January       all the other growth before that ... So the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine. People are always asking   Well  who's in charge of this   or  Who does that   And the answer is  anybody who wants to pitch in. It's a very unusual and chaotic thing. We've got over    servers now in three locations. These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online. I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to    people waiting for me to ask a question or something  anything about the servers. You could never afford to do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people    hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia. So we're doing around  .  billion page views monthly  so it's really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers. And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about       dollars. And that's essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We hired Brian because he was working part time for two years and full time at Wikipedia  so we actually hired him  so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is  why isn't it all rubbish  Why is the website as good as it is  First of all  how good is it  Well  it's pretty good. It isn't perfect  but it's much better than you would expect  given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me  you think   Oh  this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish.  But when we've seen quality tests    and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging people to do more  comparing Wikipedia to traditional things    we win hands down. So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia  which is much  much smaller than English  to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial  and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality  and we were very pleased with that result. So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush Kerry controversy. The media has covered this somewhat extensively. It started out with an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they    I mean  I have to say they spelled my name right  but they really wanted to say the Bush Kerry election is so contentious  it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying   They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.  What I actually said is they're not contentious at all. So it's a slight misquote. The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that  Extreme action sometimes has to be taken  and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of     .  This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for    occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all. Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot  but they don't cause much controversy within the community. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not between the right and the left    that's where most people assume    but it's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities. The actual truth about the specific Bush Kerry incident is that the Bush Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in       and it wasn't because they were contentious  it was just because there was routine vandalism    which happens sometimes even on stage ... Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. And I said    you know  I always say  please don't do that. That's not a good thing. So how do we do this  How do we manage the quality control  How does it work  So there's a few elements  mostly social policies and some elements of the software. So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy. This is something that I set down  from the very beginning  as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable. It's a social concept of cooperation  so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the  truth  about some topic  that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write  because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. But we have this jargon term of neutrality  which has its own long history within the community  which basically says  any time there's a controversial issue  Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done. So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political  religious  cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy  which is non negotiable from the beginning  we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior  you'll be asked to leave the community. So  real time peer review. Every single change on the site goes to the  Recent changes  page. So as soon as he made his change  it went to the  Recent changes  page. That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel  which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds    they can get email notifications of changes. And then users can set up their own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists  because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore  what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly  and then they'll just simply revert the change. There's a  new pages feed   for example  so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted  you know   ASDFASDF.  But also  that's some of the most interesting and fun things  some of the new articles. People will start an article on some interesting topic  other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better. So we do have edits by anonymous users  which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia. So  Chris was able to do his change    he didn't have to log in or anything  he just went on the website and made a change. But it turns out that only about    percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that's a really important thing to understand  the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close knit community of maybe     to       people who are in constant communication. And we have over    IRC channels     mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate. We have off line meetings. These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site  and they are  in a sense  semi professionals at what they're doing. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality. We don't always meet those standards  but that's what we're striving for. And so that tight community is who really cares for the site  and these are some of the smartest people I've ever met. It's my job to say that  but it's actually true. The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people. The tools and the software  there's lots of tools that allow us    allow us  meaning the community    to self monitor and to monitor all the work. This is an example of a page history on  flat Earth   and you can see some changes that were made. What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see   OK  I understand now.  When somebody goes and looks at    they see that someone  an anonymous IP number  made an edit to my page. That sounds suspicious. Who is this person  Somebody looks at it    they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place    to see  OK  well  these words have changed  things like this. So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page. Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open ended. Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open ended in the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules. The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page. So  I mentioned earlier  people type  ASDFASDF     it needs to be deleted. Cases like that  the administrators just delete it. There's no reason to have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is  is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia  Is the information verifiable  Is it a hoax  Is it true  Is it what  So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular example we have here  it's a film   Twisted Issues   and the first person says   Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably.  The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there  because if something's not even in Google  it probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule  but it's a nice starting point for quick research. So somebody says   Delete it  please. Delete it    it's not notable.  And then somebody says   Wait  I found it. I found it in a book  'Film Threat Video Guide  the    Underground Films You Must See.'  So the next persons says   Clean it up.  Somebody says   I've found it on IMDB. Keep  keep  keep.  And what's interesting about this is that the software is    these votes are just text typed into a page. This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day  an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say   OK     deletes  two keeps  we'll delete it.  But in other cases  this could be    deletes and two keeps  and we would keep it  because if those last two keeps say   Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book  and I found a link to a page that describes it  and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow  so please don't delete it   then it would survive. And it also matters who the people are who are voting. Like I say  it's a tight knit community. Down here at the bottom   Keep  real movie   RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism  hoaxes and votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing. So how is all this governed  People really want to know about administrators  things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model  the governance of the community  is a very confusing  but workable mix of consensus    meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles  because the majority view is not necessarily neutral    some amount of democracy    all of the administrators    these are the people who have the ability to delete pages. That doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages. They still have to follow all the rules    but they're elected by the community. Sometimes people    random trolls on the Internet    like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this  because I have no idea how they're elected  actually. There's a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that when I mentioned  like  RickK's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know. I give this talk sometimes with Angela  who was just re elected to the board from the community    to the Board of the Foundation  with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say   Well  Angela  for example  could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia  because she's so admired and so powerful.  But the irony is  of course  that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never  ever break any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say she's the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia  so ... And then there's monarchy  and that's my role on the community  so ... I was describing this in Berlin once  and the next day in the newspaper the headline said   I am the Queen of England.  And that's not exactly what I said  but    the point is my role in the community    Within the free software world  there's been a long standing tradition of the  benevolent dictator  model. So if you look at most of the major free software projects  they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator. Well  I don't like the term  benevolent dictator   and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate. But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy  a certain amount of    sometimes we have to make a decision and we don't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision making processes. So as an example of how this can be important  we recently had a situation where a neo Nazi website discovered Wikipedia  and they said   Oh  well  this is horrible  this Jewish conspiracy of a website  and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process  so we're going to send    we have        members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.  Well  they managed to get    people to show up. That's neo Nazi math for you. They always think they've got        members when they've got   . But they managed to get    people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course  the vote ended up being about    to     so there was no real danger to our democratic processes. On the other hand  people said   But what are we going to do  I mean  this could happen. What if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote   Then I said   Well  fuck it  we'll just change the rules.  That's my job in the community  to say we won't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so  as long as people trust me in my role  then that's a valid place for me. Of course  because of the free licensing  if I do a bad job  the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave    I can't tell anyone what to do. So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works  it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work  but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact  we're very flexible about the social methodology  because ultimately  the passion of the community is for the quality of the work  not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it. Thank you. Ben Saunders  Yeah  hi  Ben Saunders. Jimmy  you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education  Jimmy Wales  Yeah  so  a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia  which I think is false. It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is  there's this crazy thing  Wikipedia  but academics hate it and teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an email from a journalist saying   Why do academics hate Wikipedia   I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there. And I said   Well  they don't all hate it.  But I think there's going to be huge impacts. And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about  which is the Wikibooks project  which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages. And that's a much bigger project. It's going to take    years or so to come to fruition. But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL style CDs. We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world  if I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level  it doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it. The Wikibooks project is an effort to do that. And I think that we're going to see    it may not even come from us  there's all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education. Over the past couple of days  as I've been preparing for my speech  I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people. Being on the same stage as Al Gore  who was the first person I ever voted for. And    So I was getting pretty nervous and  you know  I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage  and that's more nerve racking. But then I started thinking about my family. I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather  and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream    that I had to consider this  my element.  So  who am I  Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband. We have about     people internationally. If you looked in the book  you saw this ... which I really was appalled by. And because I wanted to impress you all with slides  since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs  I made a graph that moves  and I talk about the makeup of me. So  besides this freakish thing  this is my science slide. This is math  and this is science  this is genetics. This is my grandmother  and this is where I get this mouth. So    I'm a blogger  which  probably  to a lot of you  means different things. You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha  where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen  and it spread all over. Kryptonite had to adjust the lock  and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns. You may have heard about Rathergate  which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the  th  in     is not typeset on an old typewriter  it's on Word. Bloggers exposed this  or they worked hard to expose this. You know  blogs are scary. This is what you see. I see this  and I'm sure scared    I swear on stage    shitless about blogs  because this is not something that's friendly. But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media  and these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands  if not millions  of readers  and that's incredibly important. During the hurricane  you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog  updating it frequently. This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools. You have my friend  who has a blog on PVRs  personal recorders. He makes enough money just by running ads  to support his family up in Oregon. That's all he does now  and this is something that blogs have made possible. And then you have something like this  which is Interplast. It's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it. Children with cleft palates get it  and they document their story. This is wonderful. I am not that caring. I talk about myself. That's what I am. I'm a blogger. I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing  and I am an expert on this person  and so I write about it. So  the short story about my blog  it started in       I was   . I wasn't happy with my job  because I was a designer  but I wasn't being really stimulated. I was an English major in college. I didn't have any use for it  but I missed writing. So  I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories. This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was    years old  and how I went to a YMCA camp  Christian camp  and basically by the end  I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk  They couldn't find me  they sent a search party  and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself    jumped off Bible Peak. You can laugh  this is OK. This is me. This is what happened to me. And when I started my blog  it was really this one goal    I said   I am not going to be famous to the world  but I could be famous to people on the Internet.  And I set a goal. I said   I'm going to win an award   because I had never won an award in my entire life. And I said   I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award.  And I won it    I reached all of these people  and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day. And then I wrote a post about a banjo. I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo    a      banjo  which is a lot of money. And I don't play instruments  I don't know anything about music. I like music  and I like banjos  and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing  and I said   I could do that.  And I said to my husband   Ben  can I buy a banjo   And he's like   No.  And my husband    this is my husband  who is very hot    he won an award for being hot. He told me   You cannot buy a banjo. You're just like your dad   who collects instruments. And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him  he was such a tyrant    he would not let me buy this banjo. And those people who know me understood my joke    this is Mena  this is how I make a joke at people. Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant  this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog. And if he knew I was showing this right now    I put this in today    he would kill me. But the thing was  my friends read it  and they're like   Oh  that Mena  she wrote a post about wanting a stupid thing and being stupid.  But I got emails from people that said   Oh my God  your husband is such an asshole. How much money does he spend on beer in a year  You could take that money and buy your banjo. Why don't you open a separate account   I've been with him since I was     we've never had a separate bank account. They said   Separate your bank account. Spend your money  spend his money  that's it.  And then I got people saying   Leave him.  I was like   OK  what  Who are these people  And why are they reading this   And I realized  I don't want to reach these people. I don't want to write for this public audience. And I started to kill my blog slowly. I'm like  I don't want to write this anymore. Slowly and slowly    And I did tell personal stories from time to time. I wrote this one  and I put this up because of Einstein today. I'm going to get choked up  because this is my first pet  and she passed away two years ago. And I decided to break from   I don't really write about my public life   because I wanted to give her a little memorial. But anyways  it's these sorts of personal stories    You know  you read the blogs about politics or about media  and gossip and all these things. These are out there  but it's more of the personal that interests me  and this is who I am. You see Norman Rockwell  and you have art critics say   Norman Rockwell is not art. Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms  and this is not something to be considered high art.  And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans. These things resonate with us  and  if you think about blogs  you think of high art blogs  the history paintings about  you know  all the biblical stories  and then you have this. These are the blogs that interest me  the people that just tell stories. One story is about this baby  and his name is Odin. His father was a blogger. And he was writing his blog one day  and his wife gave birth to her baby at    weeks. And he never expected this. One day  it was normal  the next day  it was hell. And this is a one pound baby. So Odin was documented every single day. Pictures were taken every day  day one  day two ... You have day nine    they're talking about his apnea  day       he gets pneumonia. His baby is so small  and I've never encountered such a    just    a disturbing image  but just so heartfelt. And you're reading this as it happens  so on day     everybody reads that he's having failures  breathing failures and heart failures  and it's slowing down  and you don't know what to expect. But then it gets better. Day     he goes home. And you see this post. That's not something you're going to see in a paper or magazine but this is something this person feels  and people are excited about it       comments. That's not a huge amount of people reading  but    people matter. And today  he is a healthy baby  who  if you read his blog    it's snowdeal.org  his father's blog    he is taking pictures of him still  because he is still his son and he is  I think  at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital. So  blogs. So what  You've probably heard these things before. We talked about the WELL  and about all these sorts of things throughout our online history. But I think blogs are basically just an evolution  and that's where we are today. It's this record of who you are  your persona. You have your Google search  where you say   What is Mena Trott   And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy. But then you also find people's blogs  and those are the records of people that are writing daily    not necessarily about the same topic  but things that interest them. And we talk about the world flattens  being in this panel  and I am very optimistic    whenever I think about blogs  I'm like   We've got to reach all these people.  Hundreds of millions and billions of people. We're getting into China  we want to be there  but there are so many people that won't have the access to write a blog. But to see something like the      computer is amazing  because blogging software is simple. We have a successful company because of timing  and because of perseverance  but it's simple stuff    it's not rocket science. And so  that's an amazing thing to consider. So    the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important. And we started with a slide of my Teds  and I had to add this slide  because I knew the minute I showed this  my mom    my mom will see this  because she does read my blog and she'll say   Why wasn't there a picture of me   This is my mom. So  I have all the people that I know of. But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line. I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before  and this one  I grew up with  looking at constantly. I would spend hours looking at the connections  saying   Oh  the little kid up at the top has red hair  so does that first generation up there.  And it's just these little things. This is not science  but this was enough for me to be really interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line. So that has always influenced me. I have this record  this      census  of another Grabowski    that's my maiden name    and there's a Theodore  because there's always a Theodore. This is all I have  a couple of facts about somebody. I have their date of birth  their age  what they did in their household  if they spoke English  and that's it  that's all I know of these people. And it's pretty sad  because I only go back five generations  and that's it. I don't even know what happens on my mom's side  because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things. Just doing this  I spent time in the archives    that's why my husband's a saint    I spent time in the Washington archives  just sitting there  looking for these things. Now it's online  but he sat through that. And so you have this record and    This is my great great grandmother. This is the only picture I have. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs  to think about the people that are on those      computers  talking about who they are  sharing these personal stories    this is an amazing thing. Another photo that has greatly influenced me  or a series of photos  is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife. And he's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past  what is '          ... Oh my God  I'm '         years  Twenty nine years. There was a joke  originally  about my graph that I left out  which is  You see all this math  I'm just happy I was able to add it up to      because that's my skill set. So you have these people aging  and now this is them today  or last year. And that's a powerful thing to have  to be able to track this. I wish that I would have this of my family. I know that one day my children will be wondering    or my grandchildren  or my great grandchildren  if I ever have children    what I am going to    who I was. So I do something that's very narcissistic    I am a blogger    that is an amazing thing for me  because it captures a moment in time every day. I take a picture of myself    I've been doing this since last year    every single day. And  you know  it's the same picture  it's basically the same person. Only a couple of people read it. I don't write this for this audience  I'm showing it now  but I would go insane if this was really public. About four people probably read it  and they tell me   You haven't updated.  I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated. But this is amazing  because I can go back to a day    to April       and say  what was I doing this day  I look at it  I know exactly. It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do. I put the bad pictures up too  because there are bad pictures. And I remember instantly  I am in Germany in this    I had to go for a one day trip. I was sick  and I was in a hotel room  and I wanted not to be there. And so you see these things  it's not just always smiling. Now I've kind of evolved it  so I have this look. If you look at my driver's license  I have the same look  and it's a pretty disturbing thing  but it's something that is really important. And the last story I really want to tell is this story  because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I'm doing. I'll probably get choked up  because I tend to when I talk about this. So  this woman  her name was Emma  and she was a blogger on our service  TypePad. And she was a beta tester  so she was there right when we opened    you know  there was     people. And she wrote about her life dealing with cancer. She was writing and writing  and we all started reading it  because we had so few blogs on the service  we could keep track of everyone. And she was writing one day  and then she disappeared for a little bit. And her sister came on  and she said that Emma had passed away. And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional  and it was a very hard day at the company. And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship  and flattening this sort of world. That this woman is in England  and she lives    she lived    a life where she was talking about what she was doing. But the big thing that really influenced us was  her sister wrote to me  and she said    and she wrote on this blog    that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her  and being able to talk to people and to share what was going on  and being able to write and receive comments. And that was amazing  to be able to know that we had empowered that  and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing  and the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary  that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs  that we can be people who are open  and wanting to help and talk to people. That was an amazing thing. And so I printed out and sent a PDF of her blog to her family  and they passed it out at her memorial service  and even in her obituary  they mentioned her blog  because it was such a big part of her life. And that's a huge thing. So  this is her legacy  and I think that my call to action to all of you is  think about blogs  think about what they are  think about what you've thought of them  and then actually do it  because it's something that's really going to change our lives. So  thank you. You know  when Chris first approached me to speak at TED  I said no  because I felt like I wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection  you know  that I wanted to. It's such a large conference. But he explained to me that he was in a bind  and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for. So I said fine  Ted    I mean Chris. I'll come on two conditions. One  I want to speak as early in the morning as possible. And two  I want to pick the theme for TED     . And luckily he agreed. And the theme  in two years  is going to be  Cute Pictures Of Puppies.   How to Dance Properly BASIC TWIRL   NEW SCHOOL   OLD SCHOOL   WHO'S YOUR DADDY     RIDE THE PONY    MAKE LOVE TO THE CROWD   SMACKING THAT ASS   STIR THE POT OF LOVE   HANGING OUT ... CASUAL   WORD.  I invented the Placebo Camera. It doesn't actually take pictures  but it's a hell of a lot cheaper  and you still feel like you were there.  Dear Sir  good day  compliments of the day  and my best wishes to you and family. I know this letter will come to you surprisingly  but let it not be a surprise to you  for nature has a way of arriving unannounced  and  as an adage says  originals are very hard to find  but their echoes sound ouder. So I decided to contact you myself  for you to assure me of safety and honesty  if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody. I am Mr Micheal Bangura  the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone but was killed during the civil war. Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment  and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business  on which premise I write you. Before my father death  he had the sum of    million United States dollars  which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war. This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country  before the outbreak of war. When the war broke out  the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him  my father insisted it was not in his possession  and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund. Meanwhile  my mother and I is the only person who knows about it because my father always confide in me. I made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker  who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport  Freetown  although he did not know the real contents of the box. The fund was deposited as a family reasure  in a safe  reliable security company in Dakar  Senegal  where I was only given temporary asylum. I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate  and so close to my country. The only assistance I need from you  which I know you would do for me  are the following  one  be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust  two  provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted  three  receive the funds into your account in trust  take out your commission  and leave the rest of the money until I arrive  after the transfer is complete. Sincerely  Mr Micheal Bangura.  This is really embarrassing. I was told backstage that I have    minutes. I only prepared   . So if it's cool  I'd like to just wait for three. I'm really sorry. What's your name  Mark Surfas. It's pretty cool  huh  Pursuing happiness. Are you a virgin  Virgin  I mean    no  I mean like in the TED sense  Are you  Oh  yeah  So what are you  like  a thousand  two thousand  somewhere in there  Huh  Oh  You don't know what I'm talking about  Ah  Mark    Surfas.          am I good  And that's nothing to be ashamed of. That's nothing to be ashamed of. Yeah  I was hanging out with some Google guys last night. Really cool  we were getting wasted. And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that  based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime  they can actually predict what you are going to say    next. And I was like   Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy.  But they said   No  but don't show anyone.  But they slipped up. And they said that I could just type in  What was I going to say next   and my name  and it would tell me. And I have to tell you  this is an unadulterated piece of software  this is a real Internet browser and this is the actual Google site  and we're going to test it out live today. What was I going to say next  And  Ze Frank     that's me. Am I feeling lucky  Audience  Yes  Yeah  Ze Frank  Oh  Amazing. In March of         I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's  Justify My Love.  On a Thursday  I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to    of my closest friends  as part of an invitation to my    an invitation to my th    th      th birthday party. By Monday  over a million people were coming to this site a day. Within a week  I received a call from Earthlink that said  due to a    cents per megabyte overage charge  I owed them        dollars. Needless to say  I was able to leave my job.  WAS LAID OFF  And  finally  you know  become freelance.  UNEMPLOYED  But some people refer to me more as  like  an Internet guru or     JACKASS  swami. I knew I had something. I'd basically distilled a very difficult to explain and complex philosophy  which I won't get into here  because it's a little too deep for all of you  but    It's about what makes websites popular  and  you know  it's     DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING  It's unfortunate that I don't have more time. Maybe I can come back next year  or something like that. I'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it. Four years later  I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know  and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures  you know  It's like a microscope to the rest of the world. You can kind of peer into other people's lives. And I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user. For example  somebody wrote   Hey Ze  if you ever come to Boulder  you should rock out with us   and I said   Why wait    rocking out  And they said   Hey Ze  thanks for rocking out  but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked.  And that was embarrassing. But you know  it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans  so I said   Sure.   rocking out naked  I hear a lot of you whispering. And I know what you're saying   Holy crap  How is his presentation so smooth   And I have to say that it's not all me this year. I guess Chris has to take some credit here  because in years past  I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED. I don't know. And so  this year  Chris sent us a TED conference simulator. Which really allowed us as speakers to get there  in the trenches  and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience. And I've got to say that  you know  it's really  really great to be here. I'd like to tell all of you a little joke. Not just the good stuff  though. You can do heckler mode. Voice  Hey  moron  get off the stage  ZF  You get off the stage. Voice  We want Malcolm Gladwell. In case you run over time. Just one last thing I'd like to say  I'd  really    I'd like to thank all of you for being here. And frog mode.  Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes  It's true. Some people say to me   Ze  you're doing all this stuff  this Internet stuff  and you're not making any money.   Why   And I say   Mom  Dad    I'm trying.  I don't know if you're all aware of this  but the video game market  kids are playing these video games  but  supposedly  there's tons of money. I mean  like  I think          dollars or so a year is being spent on these things. So I decided to try my hand. I came up with a few games. This is called  Atheist.  I figured it would be popular with the young kids. OK. Look  I'll move around and say some things.  Game over. There is no replay.  So that didn't go over so well. I don't really understand why you're laughing. Should have done this before I tried to pitch it.  Buddhist   of course  looks very  very similar to  Atheist.  But you come back as a duck. And this is great because  you know  for a quarter  you can play this for a long time. And Chris had said in an email that we should really bring something new to TED  something that we haven't shown anyone. So  I made this for TED. It's  Christian.  It's the third in the series. I'm hoping it's going to do well this year. Do you have a preference  Good choice. So you can wait for the Second Coming  which is a random number between one and     million. So really  what are we talking about here  Oh  tech joy. Tech joy  to me  means something  because I get a lot of joy out of tech. And in fact  making things using technology    and I'm being serious here  even though I'm using my sarcastic voice    I won't    hold on. Making things  you know    making things actually does give me a lot of joy. It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life  and it's that feeling of being about    percent complete on a project    where you know you still have something to do  but it's not finished  and you're not starting something    that really fills my entire life. And so  what I've done is  I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists. We're in a culture of guru ship. It's so hard to use some software because  you know  it's unapproachable  people feel like they have to read the manual. So I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves  and  hopefully    Whoa  I'm like    on the page  but it doesn't exist. It's  like    seriously  though    I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves. Here I created a contest called   When Office Supplies Attack   which  I think  really resonated with the working population. Over     entries in three weeks. Toilet paper fashion. Again  people from all over the country. The watch is particularly incredible. Online drawing tools    you've probably seen a lot of them. I think they're wonderful. It's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff. But I'm interested in the process of creating  as the real event that I'm interested in. And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing  and they get bummed out at this  sort of  you know  stick figure  awful little thing that they created. And eventually  it just makes them stop playing with it  or they draw penises and things like that. So  the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool. In other words  it's a helping tool. You can draw your simple stick figure  and it collaborates with you to create sort of a post war German etching. In fact  it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse. So  we go ahead  and we start scribbling. So the idea is that you can really  you know  partake in this process  but watch something really crappy look beautiful. And here are some of my favorites. This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me. Very cool. Darling. Beautiful stuff. I mean this is incredible. An    year old girl drew this and submitted it. It's just gorgeous. I'm dead serious here. This is not a joke. But  I think it's a really fun and wonderful thing. So this is called the  Fiction Project.  This is an online space  which is basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing. These are haikus. None of the haikus were written by the same person. In fact  each line is contributed by a different person at a different time. I think that the  now tied up  tied down  mistress cruel approaches me  now tied down  it's up.  It's an amazing way  and I'll tell you  if you come home  and your spouse  or whoever it is  says   Let's talk     That  like  chills you to the very core. But it's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together  doing fun things. They actually get to know each other  and it's sort of like low threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking. And very  very quickly    I love puppets. Here's a puppet. It dances to music. Lotte Reiniger  an amazing shadow puppeteer in the   s  that started doing more elaborate things. I became interested in puppets  and I just want to show one last thing to you. Oh  this is how you make puppets. Chris Anderson  Ladies and gentlemen  Mr. Ze Frank.
