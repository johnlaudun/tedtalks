As a researcher  every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting. And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you  and teaches you that you're very wrong about something that you really believed firmly in. And these are unfortunate moments  because you go to sleep that night dumber than when you woke up. So  that's really the goal of my talk  is to A  communicate that moment to you and B  have you leave this session a little dumber than when you entered. So  I hope I can really accomplish that. So  this incident that I'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea. Now  we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea. That's why there's a glass of water up there. For us  it's a problem  the people in this room. For babies  it's deadly. They lack nutrients  and diarrhea dehydrates them. And so  as a result  there is a lot of death  a lot of death. In India in       there was a    percent child mortality rate  lots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate. One of the big reasons this happened was because of diarrhea. Now  there was a big effort to solve this problem  and there was actually a big solution. This solution has been called  by some   potentially the most important medical advance this century.  Now  the solution turned out to be simple. And what it was was oral rehydration salts. Many of you have probably used this. It's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium and glucose together so that when you add it to water the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea. Remarkable impact on mortality. Massive solution to the problem. Flash forward           percent child mortality has dropped to  .  percent today. Still a big number  but a big drop. It looks like the technological problem is solved. But if you look  even today there are about         diarrhea related deaths in India alone. What's going on here  Well the easy answer is  we just haven't gotten those salts to those people. That's actually not true. If you look in areas where these salts are completely available  the price is low or zero  these deaths still continue abated. Maybe there's a biological answer. Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration alone doesn't solve. That's not true either. Many of these deaths were completely preventable  and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing  what I want to call  the last mile  problem. See  we spent a lot of energy  in many domains    technological  scientific  hard work  creativity  human ingenuity    to crack important social problems with technology solutions. That's been the discoveries of the last       years  that's mankind moving forward. But in this case we cracked it  but a big part of the problem still remains. Nine hundred and ninety nine miles went well  the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn. Now  that's for oral rehydration therapy. Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea. Well  it turns out    and this is where things get really disconcerting    it's not unique to diarrhea. It's not even unique to poor people in India. Here's an example from a variety of contexts. I've put a bunch of examples up here. I'll start with insulin  diabetes medication in the U.S. OK  the American population. On Medicaid    if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid  or if you have health insurance    insulin is pretty straightforward. You get it  either in pill form or you get it as an injection  you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels. Massive technological advance  took an incredibly deadly disease  made it solvable. Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day  About on average  a typical person is taking it    percent of the time. As a result         people a year go blind  hundreds of thousands lose limbs  every year  for something that's solvable. Here I have a bunch of other examples  all suffer from the last mile problem. It's not just medicine. Here's another example from technology  agriculture. We think there's a food problem  so we create new seeds. We think there's an income problem  so we create new ways of farming that increase income. Well  look at some old ways  some ways that we'd already cracked. Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income. Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield when you mix different varieties of rice side by side. Some people are doing that  many are not. What's going on  This is the last mile. The last mile is  everywhere  problematic. Alright  what's the problem  The problem is this little three pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears. This machine is really strange  and one of the consequences is that people are weird. They do lots of inconsistent things. They do lots of inconsistent things. And the inconsistencies create  fundamentally  this last mile problem. See  when we were dealing with our biology  bacteria  the genes  the things inside here  the blood  That's complex  but it's manageable. When we're dealing with people like this  The mind is more complex. That's not as manageable  and that's what we're struggling with. Let me go back to diarrhea for a second. Here's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey  which is a survey asked of many Indian women   Your child has diarrhea. Should you increase  maintain or decrease the number of fluids   Just so you don't embarrass yourselves  I'll give you the right answer  It's increase. Now  diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years  ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water. One Roman strategy that was very interesting was that    and it really gave them a comparative advantage    they made sure their soldiers didn't drink even remotely muddied waters. Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective on the battlefield. So  if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields  the breastplates  but part of it was drinking the right water. So  here are these women. They've seen their parents have struggled with diarrhea  they've struggled with diarrhea  they've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question  In India     to    percent say  Reduce.  Think about what that means for a second. Thirty five to    percent of women forget oral rehydration therapy  they are increasing    they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions. How is that possible  Well  one possibility    I think that's how most people respond to this    is to say   That's just stupid.  I don't think that's stupid. I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing. And that is  you don't put water into a leaky bucket. So  think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake. Just doesn't make sense. Now  the model is intuitively right. It just doesn't happen to be right about the world. But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level. And that  to me  is the fundamental challenge of the last mile. This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge. Convincing people to do something    take oral rehydration therapy  intercrop  whatever it might be    is not an act of information   Let's give them the data  and when they have data they'll do the right thing.  It's more complex than that. And if you want to understand how it's more complex let me start with something kind of interesting. I'm going to give you a little math problem  and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible. A bat and a ball together cost   .  . The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost  Quick. So  somebody out there says   Five.  A lot of you said   Ten.  Let's think about    for a second. If the ball costs     the bat costs... this is easy    .  . Yeah. So  together they would cost   .  . So  here you all are  ostensibly educated people. Most of you look smart. The combination of that produces something that is actually  you got this thing wrong. How is that possible  Let's go to something else. I know algebra can be complicated. So  let's dial this back. That's what  Fifth grade  Fourth grade  Let's go back to kindergarten. OK  There's a great show on American television that you have to watch. It's called  Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader   I think we've learned the answer to that here. Let's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five year olds. Here's what I'm going to do  I'm going to put objects on the screen. I just want you to name the color of the object. That's all it is. OK  I want you to do it fast  and say it out loud with me  and do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you. Ready  Black. Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud. Ready  Go. Audience  Red. Green. Yellow. Blue. Red. Sendhil Mullainathan  That's pretty good. Almost out of kindergarten. What is all this telling us  You see  what's going on here  and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world  some models that you use to understand the world. These models  like the leaky bucket  work well in most situations. I suspect most of you    I hope that's true for the rest of you    actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world. I found a problem  a specific problem that actually found an error with that. Diarrhea  and many last mile problems  are like that. They are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality. Same thing here  You had an intuitive response to this that was very quick. You read  blue  and you wanted to say  blue   even though you knew your task was red. Now  I do this stuff because it's fun. But it's more profound than fun. I'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion. BMW is a pretty safe car. And they are trying to figure out   Safety is good. I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety    I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests.  But the truth of the matter is  you look at that car  it doesn't look like a Volvo  and it doesn't look like a Hummer. So  what I want you to think about for a few minutes is  How would you convey safety of the BMW  Okay  So now  while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task. The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay  Here's another puzzle for all of you. One person walks into a car lot  and they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris. They are saying   This is    miles per gallon. I'm going to do the environmentally right thing  I'm going to buy the Prius     miles per gallon.  Another person walks into the lot  and they're about to buy a Hummer  nine miles per gallon  fully loaded  luxury. And they say   You know what  Do I need turbo  Do I need this heavyweight car   I'm going to do something good for the environment. I'm going to take off some of that weight  and I'm going to buy a Hummer that's    miles per gallon.  Which one of these people has done more for the environment  See  you have a mental model. Fifty versus     that's a big move. Eleven versus nine  Come on. Turns out  go home and do the math  the nine to    is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons. Why  Because we don't care about miles per gallon  we care about gallons per mile. Think about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency. Miles per gallon is the way we present things. If we want to encourage change of behavior  gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness. Researchers have found these type of anomalies. Okay  back to BMW. What should they do  The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe. This car  which is my Mini  doesn't look that safe. Here was BMW's brilliant insight  which they embodied into an ad campaign. They showed a BMW driving down the street. There's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck. The car swerves to avoid it  and therefore doesn't get into an accident. BWM realizes safety  in people's minds  has two components. You can be safe because when you're hit  you survive  or you can be safe because you avoid accidents. Remarkably successful campaign  but notice the power of it. It harnesses something you already believe. Now  even if I persuaded you to do something  it's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result. You all probably intended to wake up  I don't know          a.m. This is a battle we all fight every day  along with trying to get to the gym. Now  this is an example of that battle  and makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action  and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that. OK  So  let me now talk about the last mile problem. So far  I've been pretty negative. I've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior. And I think maybe I'm being too negative. Maybe it's the diarrhea. Maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of as the last mile opportunity. Let's go back to diabetes. This is a typical insulin injection. Now  carrying this thing around is complicated. You gotta carry the bottle  you gotta carry the syringe. It's also painful. Now  you may think to yourself   Well  if my eyes depended on it  you know  I would obviously use it every day.  But the pain  the discomfort  you know  paying attention  remembering to put it in your purse when you go on a long trip  These are the day to day of life  and they do pose problems. Here is an innovation  a design innovation. This is a pen  it's called an insulin pen  preloaded. The needle is particularly sharp. You just gotta carry this thing around. It's much easier to use  much less painful. Anywhere between five and    percent increase in adherence  just as a result of this. That's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity. You see  we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem. But the human innovation  the human problem still remains  and that's a great frontier that we have left. This isn't about the biology of people  this is now about the brains  the psychology of people  and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile. Here's another example of this. This is from a company called Positive Energy. This is about energy efficiency. We're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now. What this company does is they send a letter to households that say   Here's your energy use  here's your neighbor's energy use  You're doing well.  Smiley face.  You're doing worse.  Frown. And what they find is just this letter  nothing else  has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use. And you want to think about the social value of that in terms of carbon offsets  reduced electricity      million dollars per year. Why  Because for free  this isn't a new technology  this is a letter    we're getting a Big Bang in behavior. So  how do we tackle the last mile  I think this tells us there is an opportunity. And I think to tackle it  we need to combine psychology  marketing  art  we've seen that. But you know what we need to combine it with  We need to combine this with the scientific method. See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile  to me  is that the first     miles are all about science. No one would say   Hey  I think this medicine works  go ahead and use it.  We have testing  we go to the lab  we try it again  we have refinement. But you know what we do on the last mile   Oh  this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there.  The amount of resources we put in are disparate. We put billions of dollars into fuel efficient technologies. How much are we putting into energy behavior change in a credible  systematic  testing way  Now  I think that we're on the verge of something big. We're on the verge of a whole new social science. It's a social science that recognizes    much like science recognizes the complexity of the body  biology recognizes the complexity of the body    we'll recognize the complexity of the human mind. The careful testing  retesting  design  are going to open up vistas of understanding  complexities  difficult things. And those vistas will both create new science  and fundamental change in the world as we see it  in the next hundred years. All right. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Sendhil  thank you so much. So  this whole area is so fascinating. I mean  it sometimes feels  listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically  what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time. How much is your field talking to great marketers about their insights into human psychology  Because they've seen it on the ground. Sendhil Mullainathan  Yeah  we spend a lot of time talking to marketers  and I think    percent of it is exactly what you say  there are insights to be gleaned there. Forty percent of it is about what marketing is. Marketing is selling an ad to a firm. So  in some sense  a lot of marketing is about convincing a CEO   This is a good ad campaign.  So  there is a little bit of slippage there. That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign. And one of the new movements in marketing is  How do we actually measure effectiveness  Are we effective  CA  How you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground  in Indian villages  for example  SM  So  the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important. We work closely with companies that have operational capacity  or nonprofits that have operational capacity. And then we say   Well  you want to get this behavior change. Let's come up with a few ideas  test them  see which is working  go back  synthesize  and try to come up with a thing that works   and then we're able to scale with partners. It's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts. If you have biological problems we try and fix it  see if it works  and then work the scale. CA  Alright Sendhil  thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you. When my brother called me in December of       he said   The news does not look good.  This is him on the screen. He'd just been diagnosed with ALS  which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years. It paralyzes you. It starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord. And you go from being a healthy  robust    year old male to someone that cannot breathe  cannot move  cannot speak. This has actually been  to me  a gift  because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life. And even though Steven passed away three years ago we had an amazing journey as a family. We did not even    I think adversity is not even the right word. We looked at this and we said   We're going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way.  And I want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do  which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare. Because  as we all know here today  it doesn't work very well. I want to talk about it in the context of a story. This is the story of my brother. But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story  and go to something more.  Given my status  what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve  and how do I get there   is what we are here to do in medicine  is what everyone should do. And those questions all have variables to them. All of our statuses are different. All of our hopes and dreams  what we want to accomplish  is different  and our paths will be different  they are all stories. But it's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do  this concept we had  was to take Steven's status   What is my status   and go from this concept of walking  breathing  and then his hands  speak  and ultimately happiness and function. So  the first set of pathologies  they end up in the stick man on his icon  but the rest of them are really what's important here. Because Steven  despite the fact that he was paralyzed  as he was in that pool  he could not walk  he could not use his arms    that's why he had the little floaty things on them  did you see those     he was happy. We were at the beach  he was raising his son  and he was productive. And we took this  and we converted it into data. But it's not a data point at that one moment in time. It is a data point of Steven in a context. Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy  as a builder  taller  stronger  got all the women  amazing guy. Here he is walking down the aisle  but he can barely walk now  so it's impaired. And he could still hold his wife's hand  but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes  can't feed himself. And here he is  paralyzed completely  unable to breathe and move  over this time journey. These stories of his life  converted to data. He renovated my carriage house when he was completely paralyzed  and unable to speak  and unable to breathe  and he won an award for a historic restoration. So  here's Steven alone  sharing this story in the world. And this is the insight  the thing that we are excited about  because we have gone away from the community that we are  the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other. We need to give to others to be successful. So  Steven is sharing this story  but he is not alone. There are so many other people sharing their stories. Not stories in words  but stories in data and words. And we convert that information into this structure  this understanding  this ability to convert those stories into something that is computable  to which we can begin to change the way medicine is done and delivered. We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression  Parkinson's disease  HIV. These are not simple  they are not internet scalable  they require thought and processes to find the meaningful information about the disease. So  this is what it looks like when you go to the website. And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me  the company that myself  my youngest brother and a good friend from MIT started. Here are the actual patients  there are        of them now  sharing their stories as data. Here is an M.S. patient. His name is Mike  and he is uniformly impaired on cognition  vision  walking  sensation. Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient. Each of them can have a different characteristic. You can see fibromyalgia  HIV  ALS  depression. Look at this HIV patient down here  Zinny. It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there. But he is working to keep his CD  count high and his viral level low so he can make his life better. But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments. Look at this        people almost  on Copaxone. These are patients currently on drugs  sharing data. I love some of these  physical exercise  prayer. Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something  Let's look at prayer. What I love about this  just sort of interesting design problems. These are why people pray. Here is the schedule of how frequently they    it's a dose. So  anyone want to see the    patients that pray for    minutes a day  and see if they're doing better  they probably are. Here they are. It's an open network  everybody is sharing. We can see it all. Or  I want to look at anxiety  because people are praying for anxiety. And here is data on        people's current anxiety  right now. How they treat it  the drugs  the components of it  their side effects  all of it in a rich environment  and you can drill down and see the individuals. This amazing data allows us to drill down and see what this drug is for          people on this drug  I think. Yes. I want to talk to the    patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day. And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years. So  you can see the duration. All open  all available. I'm going to log in. And this is my brother's profile. And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now. This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash. And you can see here  as this animates over  Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients  against this information. The blue band is the   th percentile. Steven is the   th percentile  that he has non genetic ALS. You scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs  but more than that  in the new version  I can look at this interactively. Wait  poor spinal capacity. Doesn't this remind you of a great stock program  Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money  Detrol. In the side effects for his drug  integrated into that  the stem cell transplant that he had  the first in the world  shared openly for anyone who wants to see it. I love here    the cyberkinetics implant  which was  again  the only patient's data that was online and available. You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms. You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS. So  you click down on the ALS tab there. I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental. I can look at my constipation  how to manage it. I can see magnesium citrate  and the side effects from that drug all integrated in the time in which they're meaningful. But I want more. I don't want to just look at this cool device  I want to take this data and make something even better. I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs  and all of the things that interact among those  the side effects  to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it  so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what a record is. I don't even know what a medical record is. I want to solve a problem. I want an application. So  can I take this data    rearrange yourself  put the symptoms in the left  the drugs across the top  tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else  and what interacts. Years after he's had these drugs  I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva  including some positive side effects that came from other drugs  were making his constipation worse. And if anyone's ever had severe constipation  and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life    yes  that was a pun. You're trying to manage these  and this grid is available here  and we want to understand it. No one's ever had this kind of information. So  patients have this. We're for patients. This is all about patient health care  there was no doctors on our network. This is about the patients. So  how can we take this and bring them a tool that they can go back and they can engage the medical system  And we worked hard  and we thought about it and we said   What's something we can use all the time  that we can use in the medical care system  that everyone will understand   So  the patients print it out  because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network. It's actually the most used feature on the website. Doctors actually love this sheet  and they're actually really engaged. So  we went from this story of Steven and his history to data  and then back to paper  where we went back and engaged the medical care system. And here's another paper. This is a journal  PNAS    I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America. You've seen multiple of these today  when everyone's bragging about the amazing things they've done. This is a report about a drug called lithium. Lithium  that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder  that a group in Italy found slowed ALS down in    patients  and published it. Now  we'll skip the critiques of the paper. But the short story is  If you're a patient  you want to be on the blue line. You don't want to be on the red line  you want to be on the blue line. Because the blue line is a better line. The red line is way downhill  the blue line is a good line. So  you know we said    we looked at this  and what I love also is that people always accuse these Internet sites of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly. So  this is what happened when PNAS published this. Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium. Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on    patients of data in a bad publication. And they call the Internet irresponsible. Here's the implication of what happens. There's this one guy  named Humberto  from Brazil  who unfortunately passed away nine months ago  who said   Hey  listen. Can you help us answer this question  Because I don't want to wait for the next trial  it's going to be years. I want to know now. Can you help us   So  we launched some tools  we let them track their blood levels. We let them share the data and exchange it. You know  a data network. And they said  you know   Jamie  PLM  can you guys tell us whether this works or not   And we went around and we talked to people  and they said   You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know  You don't have the blinding  you don't have data  it doesn't follow the scientific method. It's never going to work. You can't do it.  So  I said   Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder.  I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients  but I can say whether it works in Humberto. I bought a Mac about two years ago  I converted over  and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in Leopard. And we said    because it's really cool  you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer  and find everything you've lost  and I loved it. And I said   What if we built a time machine for patients  except instead of going backwards  we go forwards. Can we find out what's going to happen to you  so that you can maybe change it   So  we did. We took all the patients like Humberto  That's the Apple background  we stole that because we didn't have time to build our own. This is a real app by the way. This is not just graphics. And you take those data  and we find the patients like him  and we bring their data together. And we bring their histories into it. And then we say   Well how do we line them all up   So  we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points  integrated across everything we know about the patient. Full information  the entire course of their disease. And that's what is going to happen to Humberto  unless he does something. And he took lithium  and he went down the line. And it works almost every time. Now  the ones that it doesn't work are interesting. But almost all the time it works. It's actually scary. It's beautiful. So  we couldn't run a clinical trial  we couldn't figure it out. But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto. And yeah  all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later. But here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take lithium. These are all the patients that started lithium. It's the Intent to Treat Curve. You can see here  the blue dots on the top  the light ones  those are the people in the study in PNAS that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones  the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be. And the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero  going forward  and then going backward. So  you can see we matched them perfectly  perfectly. Terrifyingly accurate matching. And going forward  you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time. You're actually doing slightly worse    not significantly  but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time. But you know  a lot of people dropped out  the trial  there is too much drop out. Can we do the even harder thing  Can we go to the patients that actually decided to stay on lithium  because they were so convinced they were getting better  We asked our control algorithm  are those    patients    by the way  you'll notice that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial    can we look at those patients and say   Can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them  and what happens   Even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly. Exactly. Those little lines  That's the power. So  we    I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper    I can tell you that for those    people that took lithium  they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them  just like me  and that we had the power to detect that at about a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study. We did that one year ahead of the time when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH for millions of dollars failed for futility last week  and announced it. So  remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant. I never really knew whether it worked. And I put     million cells in his cisterna magna  in his lumbar cord  and filled out the IRBs and did all this work  and I never really knew. How did I not know  I mean  I didn't know what was going to happen to him. I actually asked Tim  who is the quant in our group    we actually searched for about a year to find someone who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling in healthcare  couldn't find anybody. So  we went to the finance industry. And there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates  and all that kind of stuff. And some of them were available. So  we hired one. We hired them  set them up  assisting at lab. I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him  is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said   Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant worked or not   And he sent me this two days ago. It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time  We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened. Because something went different. But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line. It only works about    months. It's the first version of the time machine. First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later but    months so far. And  you know  I look at this  and I get really emotional. You look at the patients  you can drill in all the controls  you can look at them  you can ask them. And I found a woman that had    we found her  she was odd because she had data after she died. And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores  because he knew how much she cared. And I am thankful. I can't believe that these people  years after my brother had died  helped me answer the question about whether an operation I did  and spent millions of dollars on years ago  worked or not. I wished it had been there when I'd done it the first time  and I'm really excited that it's here now  because the lab that I founded has some data on a drug that might work  and I'd like to show it. I'd like to show it in real time  now  and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for. I've got to thank the        people that are doing this social experiment with us. There is an amazing journey we are going on to become human again  to be part of community again  to share of ourselves  to be vulnerable  and it's very exciting. So  thank you. The problem that I want to talk with you about is really the problem of  How does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything  How do you do that  And the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you  I want to suggest to you  is one in which you say that in order to treat disease you have to first know what you're treating    that's diagnostics    and then you have to do something. So  the program that we're involved in is something which we call Diagnostics for All  or zero cost diagnostics. How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost  How do you do it  Let me just give you two examples. The rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world    poor resources  a rigorous environment  a series of problems in lightweight  and things of this kind    and also not so different from the home healthcare and diagnostic system world. So  the technology that I want to talk about is for the third world  for the developing world  but it has  I think  much broader application  because information is so important in the healthcare system. So  you see two examples here. One is a lab that is actually a fairly high end laboratory in Africa. The second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who knows what in a table in a market. I don't know what kind of healthcare is delivered there. But it's not really what is probably most efficient. What is our approach  And the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost  starting from the perspective of the United States  is to take our solution  and then to try to cut cost out of it. No matter how you do that  you're not going to start with a         dollar instrument and bring it down to no cost. It isn't going to work. So  the approach that we took was the other way around. To ask   What is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of  and get useful information  add function   And what we've chosen is paper. What you see here is a prototypic device. It's about a centimeter on the side. It's about the size of a fingernail. The lines around the edges are a polymer. It's made of paper and paper  of course  wicks fluid  as you know  paper  cloth    drop wine on the tablecloth  and the wine wicks all over everything. Put it on your shirt  it ruins the shirt. That's what a hydrophilic surface does. So  in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a drop of  in this case  urine. The fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top. The brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine  the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine. And the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want. So  this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper. Now  how simple can you make the production  Why do we choose paper  There's an example of the same thing on a finger  showing you basically what it looks like. One reason for using paper is that it's everywhere. We have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps  and all kinds of stuff. So  the production capability is there. The second is  you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place. I'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like         tests  something of that kind. And then finally  a point that you don't think of so much in developed world medicine  it eliminates sharps. And what sharps means is needles  things that stick. If you've taken a sample of someone's blood and the someone might have hepatitis C  you don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you. It just    you don't want to do that. So  how do you dispose of that  It's a problem everywhere. And here you simply burn it. So  it's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things. Now  you say   If paper is a good idea  other people have surely thought of it.  And the answer is  of course  yes. Those half of you  roughly  who are women  at some point may have had a pregnancy test. And the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left. It's something called a lateral flow immunoassay. In that particular test  urine either  containing a hormone called HCG  does or does not flow across a piece of paper. And there are two bars. One bar indicates that the test is working  and if the second bar shows up  you're pregnant. This is a terrific kind of test in a binary world  and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you're not pregnant. You're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort. So  it works very well there  but it doesn't work very well when you need more quantitative information. There are also dipsticks  but if you look at the dipsticks  they're for another kind of urine analysis. There are an awful lot of colors and things like that. What do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance  So  the approach that we started with is to ask  Is it really practical to make things of this sort  And that problem is now  in a purely engineering way  solved. And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper. You run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer. The wax printer does what looks like printing. It is printing. You put that on  you warm it a little bit  the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper  and you end up with the device that you want. The printers cost     bucks now. They'll make  we estimate that if you were to run them    hours a day they'd make about    million tests a year. So  it's a solved problem  that particular problem is solved. And there is an example of the kind of thing that you see. That's on a piece of   by    paper. That takes about two seconds to make. And so I regard that as done. There is a very important issue here  which is that because it's a printer  a color printer  it prints colors. That's what color printers do. I'll show you in a moment  that's actually quite useful. Now  the next question that you would like to ask is  What would you like to measure  What would you like to analyze  And the thing which you'd most like to analyze  we're a fair distance from. It's what's called  fever of undiagnosed origin.  Someone comes into the clinic  they have a fever  they feel bad. What do they have  Do they have T.B.  Do they have AIDS  Do they have a common cold  The triage problem. That's a hard problem for reasons that I won't go through. There are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among. But then there are a series of things  AIDS  hepatitis  malaria  TB  others and simpler ones  such as guidance of treatment. Now even that's more complicated than you think. A friend of mine works in transcultural psychiatry  and he is interested in the question of why people do and don't take their meds. So  Dapsone  or something like that  you have to take it for a while. He has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in India and saying   Have you taken your Dapsone    Yes.   Have you taken it every day    Yes.   Have you taken if for a month    Yes.  What the guy actually meant was that he'd fed a    day dose of Dapsone to his dog  that morning. He was telling the truth. Because in a different culture  the dog is a surrogate for you  you know   today    this month    since the rainy season     there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding  and so an issue here is to  in some cases  to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting  like compliance. Now  take a look at what a typical test looks like. Prick a finger  you get some blood  about    microliters. That's about all you're going to get  because you can't use the usual sort of systems. You can't manipulate it very well  although I'll show something about that in a moment. So  you take the drop of blood  no further manipulations  you put it on a little device  the device filters out the blood cells  lets the serum go through  and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there. And the colors indicate  disease  or  normal.  But even that's complicated  because to you  to me  colors might indicate  normal   but  after all  we're all suffering from probably an excess of education. What you do about something which requires quantitative analysis  And so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there  and at this point there is a dramatic flourish  and out comes the universal solution to everything these days  which is a cell phone. In this particular case  a camera phone. They're everywhere  six billion a month in India. And the idea is that what one does  is to take the device  you dip it  you develop the color  you take a picture  the picture goes to a central laboratory. You don't have to send out a doctor  you send out somebody who can just take the sample  and in the clinic either a doctor  or ideally a computer in this case  does the analysis. Turns out to work actually quite well  particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work. So  my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor  but is an    year old  otherwise unemployed  who has two things  He has a backpack full of these tests  and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample  and an AK   . And these are the things that get him through his day. There's another very interesting connection here  and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system. It turns out there's an enormous amount of information already available on that subject  which is the Mars rover problem. How do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with  And the answer is not complicated but it's one which I don't want to go through here  other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood. Also  a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer. This is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped. I don't know whether the idea of one computer  one child makes any sense. Here's the computer of the future  because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous. All right now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices. And we'll start by posing a little problem. What you see here is another centimeter sized device  and the different colors are different colors of dye. And you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting  which is the yellow seems to disappear  get through the blue  and then get through the red. How does that happen  How do you make something flow through something  And  of course the answer is   You don't.  You make it flow under and over. But now the question is  How do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper  The answer is that what you do  and the details are not terribly important here  is to make something more elaborate  You take several different layers of paper  each one containing its own little fluid system  and you separate them by pieces of  literally  double sided carpet tape  the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor. And the fluid will flow from one layer into the next. It distributes itself  flows through further holes  distributes itself. And what you see  at the lower right hand side there  is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top  and it has gone through and distributed itself into these    holes on the bottom  in a piece of paper    basically it looks like a chip  two pieces of paper thick. And in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that. But that is  in principle  the way you solve the  fever of unexplained origin  problem  because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease  and this will work in due course. Here is an example of a slightly more complicated device. There's the chip. You dip in a corner. The fluid goes into the center. It distributes itself out into these various wells or holes  and turns color  and all done with paper and carpet tape. So  I think it's as low cost as we're likely to be able to come up and make things. Now  I have one last  two last little stories to tell you  in finishing off this business. This is one  One of the things that one does occasionally need to do is to separate blood cells from serum. And the question was  here we do it by taking a sample  we put it in a centrifuge  we spin it  and you get blood cells out. Terrific. What happens if you don't have an electricity  and a centrifuge  and whatever  And we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way  in fact  you do it is what's shown here. You get an eggbeater  which is everywhere  and you saw off a blade  and then you take tubing  and you stick it on that. You put the blood in  you spin it    somebody sits there and spins it. It works really  really well. And we sat down  we did the physics of eggbeaters and self aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing  sent it off to a journal. We were very proud of this  particularly the title  which was  Eggbeater as Centrifuge.  And we sent it off  and by return mail it came back. I called up the editor and I said   What's going on  How is this possible   The editor said  with enormous disdain   I read this. And we're not going to publish it  because we only publish science.  And it's an important issue because it means that we have to  as a society  think about what we value. And if it's just papers and phys. rev. letters  we've got a problem. Here is another example of something which is    this is a little spectrophotometer. It measures the absorption of light in a sample The neat thing about this is  you have light source that flickers on and off at about       hertz  another light source that detects that light at       hertz  and so you can run this system in broad daylight. It performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of         dollars. It costs    dollars. We can probably make it for    cents  if we put our mind to it. Why doesn't somebody do it  And the answer is   How do you make a profit in a capitalist system  doing that   Interesting problem. So  let me finish by saying that we've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem. And we've asked  What is the scientific unifying idea here  And we've decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost  but in terms of simplicity. Simplicity is a neat word. And you've got to think about what simplicity means. I know what it is but I don't actually know what it means. So  I actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people. And the most recent involved a couple of people at MIT  one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people I would think of who's an authentic genius. We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity. And I want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought. So  in a sense  you get what you pay for. Thank you very much. I'm a cancer doctor  and I walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago  and this was the cover of Fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy. And so  as a cancer doctor  you look at this  and you get a little bit downhearted. But when you start to read the article by Cliff  who himself is a cancer survivor  who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York to get an experimental therapy for    at the time    Hodgkin's disease  which saved his life  he makes remarkable points here. And the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology  in our view of cancer. For the last    years  we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer  not in controlling cancer. So  this is an astounding table. And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that  obviously  we've made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease  but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer in over    years hasn't changed. We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia  where we have a pill that can put     percent of people in remission  but in general  we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer. So  what I'm going to tell you today  is a little bit of why I think that's the case  and then go out of my comfort zone and tell you where I think it's going  where a new approach    that we hope to push forward in terms of treating cancer. Because this is wrong. So  what is cancer  first of all  Well  if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value  you go to a doctor  they stick a needle in. They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition  Does it look normal  Does it look abnormal  So  that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle. This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell. That is the state of the art today in diagnosing cancer. There's no molecular test  there's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday  there's no fancy looking at the chromosomes. This is the state of the art and how we do it. You know  I know very well  as a cancer doctor  I can't treat advanced cancer. So  as an aside  I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early. It is the only way you can start to fight cancer  is by catching it early. We can prevent most cancers. You know  the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease. We could do the same in cancer. I co founded a company called Navigenics  where  if you spit into a tube    and we can look look at    or    genetic markers for disease  all of which are delayable in many of the cancers    you start to identify what you could get  and then we can start to work to prevent them. Because the problem is  when you have advanced cancer  we can't do that much today about it  as the statistics allude to. So  the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged. Why is it a disease of the aged  Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children. See  evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then  after age    or    or     it said  It doesn't matter anymore  because they've had their progeny.  So if you look at cancers  it is very rare    extremely rare    to have cancer in a child  on the order of thousands of cases a year. As one gets older  Very  very common. Why is it hard to treat  Because it's heterogeneous  and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer. It starts to select out for those bad  aggressive cells  what we call clonal selection. But  if we start to understand that cancer isn't just a molecular defect  it's something more  then we'll get to new ways of treating it  as I'll show you. So  one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that  right now  we describe it by a number of adjectives  symptoms   I'm tired  I'm bloated  I have pain  etc.  You then have some anatomic descriptions  you get that CT scan   There's a three centimeter mass in the liver.  You then have some body part descriptions   It's in the liver  in the breast  in the prostate.  And that's about it. So  our dictionary for describing cancer is very  very poor. It's basically symptoms. It's manifestations of a disease. What's exciting is that over the last two or three years  the government has spent     million dollars  and they've allocated another billion dollars  to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. So  it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer  and giving us a new lexicon  a new dictionary to describe it. You know  in the mid     's in France  they started to describe cancer by body part. That hasn't changed in over     years. It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate  by breast  by muscle. It makes no sense  if you think about it. So  obviously  the technology is here today  and  over the next several years  that will change. You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic. You will go to a HER  amplified clinic  or an EGFR activated clinic  and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer. So  hopefully  we will go from being the art of medicine more to the science of medicine  and be able to do what they do in infectious disease  which is look at that organism  that bacteria  and then say   This antibiotic makes sense  because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it.  When one is exposed to H N   you take Tamiflu  and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease. Why  Because we know what you have  and we know how to treat it    although we can't make vaccine in this country  but that's a different story. The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now. The first cancer was done  which was brain cancer. In the next month  the end of December  you'll see ovarian cancer  and then lung cancer will come several months after. There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes  which I think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease. But remember  I'm not pushing genomics  proteomics  to be a reductionist. I'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against. And there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to. In health care today  we spend most of the dollars    in terms of treating disease    most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life. We spend very little  if any  dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against. If you could start to move that  to identify what you're up against  you're going to do things a hell of a lot better. If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease  we can take it enormously the other direction  and obviously  that's where we need to go  going forward. So  this is the website of the National Cancer Institute. And I'm here to tell you  it's wrong. So  the website of the National Cancer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease. The website says   If you look  there's an individual mutation  and maybe a second  and maybe a third  and that is cancer.  But  as a cancer doc  this is what I see. This isn't a genetic disease. So  there you see  it's a liver with colon cancer in it  and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded. You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver. Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment. It's not in the abstract  it's the interaction with the environment. It's what we call a system. The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer. And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades  is that we have strived to understand cancer. The goal is to control cancer. And that is a very different optimization scheme  a very different strategy for all of us. I got up at the American Association of Cancer Research  one of the big cancer research meetings  with        people there  and I said   We've made a mistake. We've all made a mistake  myself included  by focusing down  by being a reductionist. We need to take a step back.  And  believe it or not  there were hisses in the audience. People got upset  but this is the only way we're going to go forward. You know  I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago. We were pushed together  and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other. I said   Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney  who designed computers   And he was saying  Does he really want to meet another doctor  But people prevailed on us  and we got together  and it's been transformative in what I do  absolutely transformative. We have designed  and we have worked on the modeling    and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team    the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system. And I'll show you some data there where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it. The key is  when you look at these variables and you look at this data  you have to understand the data inputs. You know  if I measured your temperature over    days  and I asked   What was the average temperature   and it came back at   .   I would say   Great.  But if during one of those days your temperature spiked to     for six hours  and you took Tylenol and got better  etc.  I would totally miss it. So  one of the problems  the fundamental problems in medicine is that you and I  and all of us  we go to our doctor once a year. We have discrete data elements  we don't have a time function on them. Earlier it was referred to this direct life device. You know  I've been using it for two and a half months. It's a staggering device  not because it tells me how many kilocalories I do every day  but because it looks  over    hours  what I've done in a day. And I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk  and I'm not moving at all. And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really different than we understand them  because we're not measuring them dynamically. And so  if you think of cancer as a system  there's an input and an output and a state in the middle. So  the states  are equivalent classes of history  and the cancer patient  the input  is the environment  the diet  the treatment  the genetic mutations. The output are our symptoms  Do we have pain  Is the cancer growing  Do we feel bloated  etc.  Most of that state is hidden. So what we do in our field is we change and input  we give aggressive chemotherapy  and we say   Did that output get better  Did that pain improve  etc.   And so  the problem is that it's not just one system  it's multiple systems on multiple scales. It's a system of systems. And so  when you start to look at emergent systems  you can look at a neuron under a microscope. A neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here  but when you start to put them together in a complex system  and you start to see that it becomes a brain  and that brain can create intelligence  what we're talking about in the body  and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system. Well  the bad news is that these robust    and robust is a key word    emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail. The good news is you can manipulate them. You can try to control them without that fundamental understanding of every component. One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine  where they took women who were pre menopausal with breast cancer. So  about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get. They had gotten their chemotherapy  and then they randomized them  where half got placebo  and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone. It's used to treat osteoporosis  and they got that twice a year. They looked and  in these       women  given twice a year a drug that builds bone  you reduce the recurrence of cancer by    percent. Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn't even touch the cancer. So the notion  you change the soil  the seed doesn't grow as well. You change that system  and you could have a marked effect on the cancer. Nobody has ever shown    and this will be shocking    nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell. It's never been shown. There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes  that if you give this cancer drug  you can do this effect to the cell  but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body. If I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol every three weeks  which is the standard  about    percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug. And a response is    percent shrinkage. Well  remember that's not even an order of magnitude  but that's a different story. They then recur  I give them that same drug every week. Another    percent will respond. They then recur  I give them that same drug over    hours by continuous infusion  another    or    percent will respond. So  you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size. It's not. We have no idea the mechanism. So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system  just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence  chemotherapy may work by that same exact way. The wild thing about that trial also  was that it reduced new primaries  so new cancers  by    percent also. So  the problem is  yours and mine  all of our systems are changing. They're dynamic. I mean  this is a scary slide  not to take an aside  but it looks at obesity in the world. And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers  they're kind of small. But  if you start to look at it  that red  that dark color there  more than    percent of the population of those countries are obese. Look a decade ago  look two decades ago  markedly different. So  our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago. So the diseases we have today  which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades  are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this. So  this picture  although it is beautiful  is a    gigabyte picture of the whole proteome. So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet  and we're able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body. We can start to see that system. Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified. The power of these magnets  the power of what we can do here  is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology. So  again  this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis and a group called Applied Proteomics  where we can start to see individual neutron differences  and we can start to look at that system like we never have before. So  instead of a reductionist view  we're taking a step back. So this is a woman     years old  who had recurrent lung cancer. It was in her brain  in her lungs  in her liver. She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol  Carboplatin Taxotere  Gemcitabine  Navelbine  Every drug we have she had gotten  and that disease continued to grow. She had three kids under the age of     and this is her CT scan. And so what this is  is we're taking a cross section of her body here  and you can see in the middle there is her heart  and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her  untreated  in a matter of weeks. She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway  and again  I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system  in the cancer  but it targeted a pathway  and a month later  pow  that cancer's gone. Six months later it's still gone. That cancer recurred  and she passed away three years later from lung cancer  but she got three years from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne. That's about it. So  the problem is that the clinical trial was done  and we were a part of it  and in the fundamental clinical trial    the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three  we refused to use a placebo. Would you want your mother  your brother  your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live  And the answer  obviously  is not. So  it was done on this group of patients. Ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here  and the drug went to the FDA  and the FDA said   Without a placebo  how do I know patients actually benefited from the drug   So the morning the FDA was going to meet  this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal. And so  what do you know  that drug was approved. The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial  where they gave half placebo and half the drug. And we learned something important there. What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada  where it's  more ethical to give placebos.  They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval  so I think there were three U.S. patients in upstate New York who were part of the trial. But they did that  and what they found is that    percent of the non responders lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo. So it challenged everything we knew in cancer  is that you don't need to get a response. You don't need to shrink the disease. If we slow the disease  we may have more of a benefit on patient survival  patient outcome  how they feel  than if we shrink the disease. The problem is that  if I'm this doc  and I get your CT scan today and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver  and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters  did that drug help you or not  How do I know  Would it have been    centimeters  or am I giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost  So  it's a fundamental problem. And  again  that's where these new technologies can come in. And so  the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office    well  the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease  right  The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening. That is the most effective  cost effective  best way we can do things today. But if one is unfortunate to get a disease  you'll go into your doctor's office  he or she will take a drop of blood  and we will start to know how to treat your disease. The way we've approached it is the field of proteomics  again  this looking at the system. It's taking a big picture. The problem with technologies like this is that if one looks at proteins in the body  there are    orders of magnitude difference between the high abundant and the low abundant proteins. So  there's no technology in the world that can span    orders of magnitude. And so  a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles  try to bring the software. We can start to look at different components along this spectrum. And so  earlier was talked about cross discipline  about collaboration. And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in. Yesterday  the National Cancer Institute announced a new program called the Physical Sciences and Oncology  where physicists  mathematicians  are brought in to think about cancer  people who never approached it before. Danny and I got    million dollars  they announced yesterday  to try to attach this problem. A whole new approach  instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by different mechanisms  to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body. So  just for two seconds  how these technologies work    because I think it's important to understand it. What happens is every protein in your body is charged  so the proteins are sprayed in  the magnet spins them around  and then there's a detector at the end. When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge. And so we can accurately    if the magnet is big enough  and your resolution is high enough    you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system. And so  as a cancer doctor  instead of having paper in my chart  in your chart  and it being this thick  this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices  where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data. Electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease. And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward  instead of just having encounter and encounter  without fundamental learning. So  to conclude  we need to get away from reductionist thinking. We need to start to think differently and radically. And so  I implore everyone here  Think differently. Come up with new ideas. Tell them to me or anyone else in our field  because over the last    years  nothing has changed. We need a radically different approach. You know  Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel    and Andy was one of my mentors  tough individual. When Andy stepped down  he said   No technology will win. Technology itself will win.  And I'm a firm believer  in the field of medicine and especially cancer  that it's going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the near term. Thank you very much. John Hockenberry  It's great to be here with you  Tom. And I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work. In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force. Are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work  Tom Shannon  Yeah  the subject matter that I'm looking for  it's usually to solve a question. I had the question popped into my head  What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres  And in proportion  what would the size of the sphere and the length  and what would the taper be to the Earth  And so I went about and made that sculpture  turning it out of solid bronze. And I did one that was about    feet long. The sun end was about four inches in diameter  and then it tapered over about    feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end. And so for me  it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context  as though you were an astronaut  and see these two things as an object  because they are so intimately bound  and one is meaningless without the other. JH  Is there a relief in playing with these forces  And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces. TS  Well  like the magnetically levitated objects    like that silver one there  that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets  trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground. So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that. JH  Now is this electromagnetic here  or are these static  TS  Those are permanent magnets  yeah. JH  Because if the power went out  there would just be a big noise. TS  Yeah. It's really unsatisfactory having plug in art. JH  I agree. TS  The magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism  so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything. The sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun. So there's this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe. But with the pendulum  it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up. My sculptures are normally very simplified. I try to refine them down to very simple forms. But the paintings become very complex  because I think the fields that are supporting them  they're billowing  and they're interpenetrating  and they're interference patterns. JH  And they're non deterministic. I mean  you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin  even though the forces can be calculated. So the evolution of this    I gather this isn't your first pendulum. TS  No.  JH  No.  TS  The first one I did was in the late   's  and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it. I threw it into an orbit  and it only had one color  and when it got to the center  the paint kept running out  so I had to run in there  didn't have any control over the spigot remotely. So that told me right away  I need a remote control device. But then I started dreaming of having six colors. I sort of think about it as the DNA    these colors  the red  blue  yellow  the primary colors and white and black. And if you put them together in different combinations    just like printing in a sense  like how a magazine color is printed    and put them under certain forces  which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them  these amazing things started appearing. JH  It looks like we're loaded for bear here. TS  Yeah  well let's put a couple of canvases. I'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here. I want to just say    so this is Jack  Nick and Louie. JH  Thanks guys. TS  So here are the    JH  All right  I'll get out of the way here. TS  I'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front. JH  Whoa. That is ... ooh  nice. TS  So something like this. I'm doing this as a demo  and it's more playful  but inevitably  all of this can be used. I can redeem this painting  just continuing on  doing layers upon layers. And I keep it around for a couple of weeks  and I'm contemplating it  and I'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level  where all of this becomes the background  the depth of it. JH  That's fantastic. So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio controlled airplane valves. TS  Yes  they're servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes. And they can pinch them very tight and stop it  or you can have them wide open. And all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom. You can always be changing colors  put aluminum paint  or I could put anything into this. It could be tomato sauce  or anything could be dispensed    sand  powders or anything like that. JH  So many forces there. You've got gravity  you've got the centrifugal force  you've got the fluid dynamics. Each of these beautiful paintings  are they images in and of themselves  or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas  TS  Well  this painting here  I wanted to do something very simple  a simple  iconic image of two ripples interfering. So the one on the right was done first  and then the one on the left was done over it. And then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before. And then when I did the second one  it really disturbed the piece    these big blue lines crashing through the center of it    and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap. There are lines in front of the one on the right  and there are lines behind the one on the left  and so it takes it into different planes. What it's also about  just the little events  the events of the interpenetration of    JH  Two stars  or    TS  Two things that happened    there's an interference pattern  and then a third thing happens. There are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening  and I'm very interested in that. Like the occurrence of moire patterns. Like this green one  this is a painting I did about    years ago  but it has some    see  in the upper third    there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery. And that's something that in painting I've never seen done. I've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns  which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives. JH  Is that a literal part of the image  or is my eye making that interference pattern    is my eye completing that interference pattern  TS  It is the paint actually  makes it real. It's really manifested there. If I throw a very concentric circle  or concentric ellipse  it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines  which get closer and closer together  which describes how gravity works. There's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that I really enjoy. And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus  especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it  the scale  is very interesting to me. My focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology. Some of these paintings  when you look at them very close  odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles  elephants. There are lots of things that appear. When you look into it  it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns  but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered. And then there are all these forms that we don't know what they are  but they're equally well resolved and complex. So I think  conceivably  those could be predictive. Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology  it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with. And maybe it's the kind of forms we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars  where there are probably lakes with fish swimming under the surface. JH  Oh  let's hope so. Oh  my God  let's. Oh  please  yes. Oh  I'm so there. You know  it seems at this stage in your life  you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant    I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life. Is that relevant to your work  TS  As it turns out  this device kind of comes in handy  because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do  that I can operate slides  which is more of a mental process. I'm looking at it and making decisions  It needs more red  it needs more blue  it needs a different shape. And so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much  much simpler way. I mean  I've got the symptoms. I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years  but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms. In my case  my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also. I'm left handed  and so I draw. All my creations really start on small drawings  which I have thousands of  and it's my way of just thinking. I draw with a simple pencil  and at first  the Parkinson's was really upsetting  because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still. JH  So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces. You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces. You think of yourself as the servant. TS  Nature is    well  it's a godsend. It just has so much in it. And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature  humans are of the universe. The universe is in our mind  and our minds are in the universe. And we are expressions of the universe  basically. As humans  ultimately being part of the universe  we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe. And to interface with it  with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do  giving them pigment and paint just like an artist  it's a good ally. It's a terrific studio assistant. JH  Well  I love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand  some sort of more elemental force gets revealed  and that's the beauty here. Tom  thank you so much. It's been really  really great. TS  Thank you  John. I am going to speak about corruption  but I would like to juxtapose two different things. One is the large global economy  the large globalized economy  and the other one is the small  and very limited  capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern  to shape  this economy. Because there is this asymmetry  which creates  basically  failing governance. Failing governance in many areas  in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment  in the area of exploitation of women and children  in the area of climate change  in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into the economy  which is operating in a worldwide arena. And I think corruption  and the fight against corruption  and the impact of corruption  is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what I mean with this failure of governance. Let me talk about my own experience. I used to work as the director of the World Bank office in Nairobi for East Africa. At that time  I noticed that corruption  that grand corruption  that systematic corruption  was undermining everything we were trying to do. And therefore  I began to not only try to protect the work of the World Bank  our own projects  our own programs against corruption  but in general  I thought   We need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption.  And as soon as I started this work  I received a memorandum from the World Bank  from the legal department first  in which they said   You are not allowed to do this. You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries. This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank  so I want you to stop your doings.  In the meantime  I was chairing donor meetings  for instance  in which the various donors  and many of them like to be in Nairobi    it is true  it is one of the unsafest cities of the world  but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable. And in these donor meetings  I noticed that many of the worst projects    which were put forward by our clients  by the governments  by promoters  many of them representing suppliers from the North    that the worst projects were realized first. Let me give you an example  a huge power project      million dollars  to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable  and one of the most beautiful  areas of western Kenya. And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits  It had no clients  nobody would buy the electricity there  nobody was interested in irrigation projects. To the contrary  we knew that this project would destroy the environment  It would destroy riparian forests  which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups  the Samburu and the Turkana in this area. So everybody knew this is a  not a useless project  this is an absolute damaging  a terrible project    not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars  and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools  like hospitals and so on. And yet  we all rejected this project  none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it  and it was the first project to be implemented. The good projects  which we as a donor community would take under our wings  they took years  you know  you had too many studies  and very often they didn't succeed. But these bad projects  which were absolutely damaging    for the economy for many generations  for the environment  for thousands of families who had to be resettled    they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks  of supplier agencies  of insurance agencies    like in Germany  Hermes  and so on    and they came back very  very quickly  driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the North. Now  these suppliers were our big companies. They were the actors of this global market  which I mentioned in the beginning. They were the Siemenses of this world  coming from France  from the UK  from Japan  from Canada  from Germany  and they were systematically driven by systematic  large scale corruption. We are not talking about        dollars here  or         dollars there  or one million dollars there. No  we are talking about    million     million dollars on the Swiss bank accounts  on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein  of the president's ministers  the high officials in the para statal sectors. This was the reality which I saw  and not only one project like that  I saw  I would say  over the years I worked in Africa  I saw hundreds of projects like this. And so  I became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy making in these countries  which is the main reason for the misery  for the poverty  for the conflicts  for the violence  for the desperation in many of these countries. That we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line  that we have more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world  twice that number  more than two billion people without sanitation and so on  and the consequent illnesses of mothers and children  still  child mortality of more than    million people every year  children dying before they are five years old  The cause of this is  to a large extent  grand corruption. Now  why did the World Bank not let me do this work  I found out afterwards  after I left  under a big fight  the World Bank. The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay  including Germany. In Germany  foreign bribery was allowed. It was even tax deductible. No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany  but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia  everywhere  systematically bribed. Not all of them  but most of them. And this is the phenomenon which I call failing governance  because when I then came to Germany and started this little NGO here in Berlin  at the Villa Borsig  we were told   You cannot stop our German exporters from bribing  because we will lose our contracts. We will lose to the French  we will lose to the Swedes  we'll lose to the Japanese.  And therefore  there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma  which made it very difficult for an individual company  an individual exporting country to say   We are not going to continue this deadly  disastrous habit of large companies to bribe.  So this is what I mean with a failing governance structure  because even the powerful government  which we have in Germany  comparatively  was not able to say   We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad.  They needed help  and the large companies themselves have this dilemma. Many of them didn't want to bribe. Many of the German companies  for instance  believe that they are really producing a high quality product at a good price  so they are very competitive. They are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are  but they were not allowed to show their strengths  because the world was eaten up by grand corruption. And this is why I'm telling you this  Civil society rose to the occasion. We had this small NGO  Transparency International. They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma  and we developed concepts of collective action  basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table  explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing  and to make a long story short  we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters. In       a convention  under the auspices of the OECD  which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery. Well  thank you. I mean  it's interesting  in doing this  we had to sit together with the companies. We had here in Berlin  at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee  we had sessions with about    captains of industry  and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery. In the first session    we had three sessions over the course of two years. And President von Weizs cker  by the way  chaired one of the sessions  the first one  to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs  who were not used to deal with non governmental organizations. And in the first session  they all said   This is not bribery  what we are doing.  This is customary there. This is what these other cultures demand. They even applaud it. In fact   unclear  still says this today. And so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing. But in the second session  they admitted already that they would never do this  what they are doing in these other countries  here in Germany  or in the U.K.  and so on. Cabinet ministers would admit this. And in the final session  at the Aspen Institute  we had them all sign an open letter to the Kohl government  at the time  requesting that they participate in the OECD convention. And this is  in my opinion  an example of soft power  because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us. We had a longer term time perspective. We had a broader  geographically much wider  constituency we were trying to defend. And that's why the law has changed. That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in. In some other countries  the OECD convention is not yet properly enforced. And  again  civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment. In London  for instance  where the BAE got away with a huge corruption case  which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute      million British pounds  every year for ten years  to one particular official of one particular friendly country  who then bought for    billion pounds of military equipment. This case  they are not prosecuting in the UK. Why  Because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of Great Britain. Civil society is pushing  civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem  also in the U.K.  and also in Japan  which is not properly enforcing  and so on. In Germany  we are pushing the ratification of the UN convention  which is a subsequent convention. We are  Germany  is not ratifying. Why  Because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies. In Germany  we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant  but you are allowed to bribe a deputy. This is  under German law  allowed  and the members of our parliament don't want to change this  and this is why they can't sign the U.N. convention against foreign bribery    one of they very  very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world  but not able to ratify the convention  which we managed to get on the books with about     countries all over the world. I see my time is ticking. Let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened. I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption  one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance. By now  the United Nations is totally on our side. The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus  under Wolfensohn  they became  I would say  the strongest anti corruption agency in the world. Most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on. And this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem  in the development of remedies  in the implementation of reforms  and then later  in the monitoring of reforms. Of course  if civil society organizations want to play that role  they have to grow into this responsibility. Not all civil society organizations are good. The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO. So  we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself. They have to have a much more transparent financial governance. They have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations. We also need much more competence of civil society leaders. This is why we have set up the governance school and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin  because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in Germany and continental Europe in general  do not focus enough  yet  on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society. But what I'm saying from my very practical experience  If civil society does it right and joins the other actors    in particular  governments  governments and their international institutions  but also large international actors  in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility    then in this magical triangle between civil society  government and private sector  there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world. Thank you. Sadly  in the next    minutes when I do our chat  four Americans that are alive will be dead through the food that they eat. My name's Jamie Oliver. I'm    years old. I'm from Essex in England and for the last seven years I've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way. I'm not a doctor  I'm a chef  I don't have expensive equipment or medicine. I use information  education. I profoundly believe that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life. We have an awful  awful reality right now. America  you're at the top of your game. This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world. Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today  Put your hands up. You can continue to put your hands up  aunties and uncles as well. Most of you. OK. We  the adults of the last four generations  have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents. Your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we've built around them. Two thirds of this room  today  in America  are statistically overweight or obese. You lot  you're all right  but we'll get you eventually  don't worry. The statistics of bad health are clear  very clear. We spend our lives being paranoid about death  murder  homicide  you name it  it's on the front page of every paper  CNN. Look at homicide at the bottom  for God's sake. Right  Every single one of those in the red is a diet related disease. Any doctor  any specialist will tell you that. Fact  diet related disease is the biggest killer in the United States  right now  here today. This is a global problem. It's a catastrophe. It's sweeping the world. England is right behind you  as usual. I know they were close  but not that close. We need a revolution. Mexico  Australia  Germany  India  China  all have massive problems of obesity and bad health. Think about smoking. It costs way less than obesity now. Obesity costs you Americans    percent of your health care bills      billion dollars a year. In    years  it's set to double      billion dollars a year. Let's be honest  guys  you haven't got that cash. I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in. We need it. The time is now. We're in a tipping point moment. I've been doing this for seven years. I've been trying in America for seven years. Now is the time when it's ripe    ripe for the picking. I went to the eye of the storm. I went to West Virginia  the most unhealthy state in America. Or it was last year. We've got a new one this year  but we'll work on that next season. Huntington  West Virginia. Beautiful town. I wanted to put heart and soul and people  your public  around the statistics that we've become so used to. I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about  your public  your children. I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany. She's    years old. She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten. She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up within a food environment where they've been taught to cook at home or in school  or her mom  or her mom's mom. She has six years to live. She's eating her liver to death. Stacy  the Edwards family. This is a normal family  guys. Stacy does her best  but she's third generation as well  she was never taught to cook at home or at school. The family's obese. Justin here     years old  he's     pounds. He gets bullied  for God's sake. The daughter there  Katie  she's four years old. She's obese before she even gets to primary school. Marissa  she's all right  she's one of your lot. But you know what  Her father  who was obese  died in her arms  And then the second most important man in her life  her uncle  died of obesity  and now her step dad is obese. You see  the thing is  obesity and diet related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it  it's all of their friends  families  brothers  sisters. Pastor Steve  an inspirational man  one of my early allies in Huntington  West Virginia. He's at the sharp knife edge of this problem. He has to bury the people  OK  And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends  his family  his community. Come winter  three times as many people die. He's sick of it. This is preventable disease. Waste of life. By the way  this is what they get buried in. We're not geared up to do this. Can't even get them out the door  and I'm being serious. Can't even get them there. Forklift. OK  I see it as a triangle  OK  This is our landscape of food. I need you to understand it. You've probably heard all this before. Over the last    years  what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country  Let's be frank and honest. Well  modern day life. Let's start with the Main Street. Fast food has taken over the whole country  we know that. The big brands are some of the most important powers  powerful powers  in this country. Supermarkets as well. Big companies. Big companies. Thirty years ago  most of the food was largely local and largely fresh. Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives  extra ingredients  and you know the rest of the story. Portion size is obviously a massive  massive problem. Labeling is a massive problem. The labeling in this country is a disgrace. The industry wants to self police themselves. What  in this kind of climate  They don't deserve it. How can you say something is low fat when it's full of so much sugar  Home. The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture  what made our society. That is not happening anymore. And you know  as we go to work and as life changes  and as life always evolves  we kind of have to look at it holistically    step back for a moment  and re address the balance. It hasn't happened for    years  OK  I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now  the Edwards family. This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week. And I need you to know that this is going to kill your children early. How are you feeling  Stacy  Just feeling really sad and depressed right now. But  you know  I want my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. But I'm killing them. JO  Yes you are. You are. But we can stop that. Normal. Let's get on schools  something that I'm fairly much a specialist in. OK  school. What is school  Who invented it  What's the purpose of school  School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative  do wonderful things  make us earn a living  etc.  etc. You know  it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long  long time  OK  But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of America  OK  School food is something that most kids       million a day  actually    have twice a day  more than often  breakfast and lunch      days of the year. So you could say that school food is quite important  really  judging the circumstances. Before I crack into my rant  which I'm sure you're waiting for    I need to say one thing  and it's so important in  hopefully  the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months. The lunch ladies  the lunch cooks of America    I offer myself as their ambassador. I'm not slagging them off. They're doing the best they can do. They're doing their best. But they're doing what they're told  and what they're being told to do is wrong. The system is highly run by accountants  there's not enough  or any  food knowledgeable people in the business. There's a problem  If you're not a food expert  and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter  then you can't be creative  you can't duck and dive and write different things around things. If you're an accountant  and a box ticker  the only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit. Now  the reality is  the food that your kids get every day is fast food  it's highly processed  there's not enough fresh food in there at all. You know  the amount of additives  E numbers  ingredients you wouldn't believe    there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery. Knives and forks  No  they're too dangerous. They have scissors in the classroom  but knives and forks  No. And the way I look at it is  If you don't have knives and forks in your school  you're purely endorsing  from a state level  fast food  because it's handheld. And yes  by the way  it is fast food  It's sloppy Joes  it's burgers  it's wieners  it's pizzas  it's all of that stuff. Ten percent of what we spend on health care  as I said earlier  is on obesity  and it's going to double. We're not teaching our kids. There's no statutory right to teach kids about food  elementary or secondary school  OK  We don't teach kids about food  right  And this is a little clip from an elementary school  which is very common in England. Child  Potatoes. Jamie Oliver  Potato  So  you think these are potatoes  Do you know what that is  Do you know what that is  Child  Broccoli  JO  What about this  Our good old friend. Child  Celery. JO  No. What do you think this is  Child  Onion. JO  Onion  No. JO  Immediately you get a really clear sense of  Do the kids know anything about where food comes from   Who knows what that is  Child  Uh  pear  JO  What do you think this is  Child  I don't know. JO  If the kids don't know what stuff is  then they will never eat it. JO  Normal. England and America  England and America. Guess what fixed that. Two one hour sessions. We've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools  period. I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in  guys  OK  I want to talk about something so basic as milk. Every kid has the right to milk at school. Your kids will be having milk at school  breakfast and lunch  right  They'll be having two bottles  OK  And most kids do. But milk ain't good enough anymore. Don't get me wrong  I support milk    but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings  colorings and sugar in milk  more kids will drink it. Yeah. Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well. Do you know what I mean  For me  there isn't any need to flavor the milk. Okay  There's sugar in everything. I know the ins and outs of those ingredients. It's in everything. Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern day problems. There's our milk. There's our carton. In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop  and they are having two a day. So  let me just show you. We've got one kid  here    having  you know  eight tablespoons of sugar a day. You know  there's your week. There's your month. And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar  just from milk. Now  I don't know about you guys  but judging the circumstances  right  any judge in the whole world  would look at the statistics and the evidence  and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse. That's my belief. Now  if I came up here  and I wish I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer  you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me. This  all this bad news  is preventable. That's the good news. It's very  very preventable. So  let's just think about  we got a problem here  we need to reboot. Okay so  in my world  what do we need to do  Here is the thing  right  it cannot just come from one source. To reboot and make real tangible change  real change  so that I could look you in the white of the eyes and say   In    years' time  the history of your children's lives  happiness    and let's not forget  you're clever if you eat well  you know you're going to live longer    all of that stuff  it will look different. OK   So  supermarkets. Where else do you shop so religiously  Week in  week out. How much money do you spend  in your life  in a supermarket  Love them. They just sell us what we want. All right. They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket. They need to help us shop. They need to show us how to cook quick  tasty  seasonal meals for people that are busy. This is not expensive. It is done in some  and it needs to be done across the board in America soon  and quick. The big brands  you know  the food brands  need to put food education at the heart of their businesses. I know  easier said than done. It's the future. It's the only way. Fast food. With the fast food industry you know  it's very competitive. I've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants. I know how they do it. I mean  basically they've weaned us on to these hits of sugar  salt and fat  and x  y  and z  and everyone loves them  right  So  these guys are going to be part of the solution. But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry  and over a five  six  seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat  sugar and all the other non food ingredients. Now  also  back to the sort of big brands  labeling  I said earlier  is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted. OK  school. Obviously  in schools  we owe it to them to make sure those     days of the year  from that little precious age of four  until             whatever  they need to be cooked proper  fresh food from local growers on site  OK  There needs to be a new standard of fresh  proper food for your children  yeah  Under the circumstances  it's profoundly important that every single American child leaves school knowing how to cook    recipes that will save their life. Life skills. That means that they can be students  young parents  and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking  no matter what recession hits them next time. If you can cook  recession money doesn't matter. If you can cook  time doesn't matter. The workplace  we haven't really talked about it. You know  it's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff. The staff are the moms and dads of America's children. Marissa  her father died in her hand  I think she'd be quite happy if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly. Definitely they shouldn't be left out. Let's go back to the home. Now  look  if we do all this stuff  and we can  it's so achievable. You can care and be commercial. Absolutely. But the home needs to start passing on cooking again  for sure. For sure  pass it on as a philosophy. And for me  it's quite romantic  but it's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something  and they teach three of their mates  that only has to repeat itself    times  and that's the whole population of America. Romantic  yes  but most importantly  it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference. We've got to put back what's been lost. Huntington's Kitchen. Huntington  where I made this program  we've got this prime time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change. I truly believe that change will happen. Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community. I worked in the schools. I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area from the junk  onto the fresh food  six and a half grand per school. That's all it takes  six and a half grand per school. The Kitchen is    grand a month. Okay  This can do       people a year  which is    percent of their population  and it's people on people. You know  it's local cooks teaching local people. It's free cooking lessons  guys  in the Main Street. This is real  tangible change  real  tangible change. Around America  if we just look back now  there is plenty of wonderful things going on. There is plenty of beautiful things going on. There are angels around America doing great things in schools    farm to school set ups  garden set ups  education    there are amazing people doing this already. The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school  but there's no cash. We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly  identify them  and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they're already doing  and doing well. Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do. And look  I know it's weird having an English person standing here before you talking about all this. All I can say is  I care. I'm a father  and I love this country. And I believe truly  actually  that if change can be made in this country  beautiful things will happen around the world. If America does it  other people will follow. It's incredibly important. When I was in Huntington  trying to get a few things to work when they weren't  I thought  If I had a magic wand  what would I do   And I thought   You know what  I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America.  And a month later  TED phoned me up and gave me this award. I'm here. So  my wish. Dyslexic  so I'm a bit slow. My wish is for you to help a strong  sustainable movement to educate every child about food  to inspire families to cook again  and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity. Thank you. About a year and a half ago  Stephen Lawler  who also gave a talk here at TED in      on Virtual Earth  brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps  which is Microsoft's online mapping effort. In the past two and a half  we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to. So  the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning  which  if you're familiar at all with Seadragon  that's where it comes from. Mapping is  of course  not just about cartography  it's also about imagery. So  as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City like virtual view at    degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the  D structure of the city  all the facades. Now  we see this space  this three dimensional environment  as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out  and map's directions are really just one of them. If you click on this  you'll see some of the ones that we've put out  just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So  for example  a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti  we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper local blogs in real time and mapping those stories  those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful. But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. So  we see the imagery  of course  not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either  but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. And so  when you fly down    Thank you. When you fly down to the ground  and you see this kind of panoramic imagery  the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture  there's just as much three dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three dimensional city from above  so if I click on something to get a closer view of it  then  the fact that that transition looks as it does  is a function of all of that geometry  all of that  D understanding behind this model. Now  I'll show you a fun app that    we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr  georegistered imagery and uses photosynth like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery  so    I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up  but    But notice    this is  of course  a popular tourist site  and there are lots of photos around here  and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo  that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd sourced imagery is integrating  in a very deep way  into the map itself. Thank you. There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them  of course  is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here  but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that  not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users  but it also is the foundation for augmented reality  and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK  notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera  so  we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars  but we're also imaging inside. And from here  we're able to do the same sorts of registration  not only of still images  but also of video. So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time  live  and this is really  truly  very frightening. OK. All right  guys  are you there  All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So  these are our friends in Pike Place Market  the lab. So they're broadcasting this live. OK  George  can you pan back over to the corner market  Because I want to show points of interest. No  no. The other way. Yeah  yeah  back to the corner  back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK  OK  back to the corner  back to the corner  back to the corner. OK  never mind. What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way  if you're actually on the spot  you can think about this    this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. What the hell are you guys    oh  sorry. We're doing two different    OK  I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ... All right  let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside  I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence  but you can equally well use this on the spot  for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot  it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here  we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast  by the way  on a  G network from the market. All right  and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong  WorldWide Telescope. So  we're going to head over to the dumpsters  where it's traditional  after a long day at the market  to go out for a break  but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. This is the current    thank you    this is the current time. If we scrub the time  then we can see how the sky will look at different times  and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times  different dates  Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky  maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So  this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth. All right now  I've overrun my time  so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much. Someone once said that politics is  of course   showbiz for ugly people.  So  on that basis  I feel like I've really arrived. The other thing to think of is what an honor it is  as a politician  to give a TED talk  particularly here in the U.K.  where the reputation of politics  with the expenses scandal  has sunk so low. There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked  Why   and they said   Well  there's no shortage of politicians  no one really minds what happens to them and  after all  there are some things that rats just won't do.  Now  I know you all love data  so I'm starting with a data rich slide. This  I think  is the most important fact to bear in mind in British politics or American politics  and that is  We have run out of money. We have vast budget deficits. This is my global public debt clock  and  as you can see  it's    trillion and counting. And I think what this leads to is a very simple recognition  that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other  and it's this one  How do we make things better without spending more money  Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services  or to improve government  or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about. So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money    you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money  you can only measure progress by spending money    you're going to have a pretty miserable time. But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being    things like your family relationships  friendship  community  values    then  actually  this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics. And the really simple argument I want to make tonight  the really straightforward argument is this  That if we combine the right political philosophy  the right political thinking  with the incredible information revolution that has taken place  and that all of you know so much more about than I do  I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics  remake government  remake public services  and achieve what's up on that slide  which is a big increase in our well being. That's the argument I want to make tonight. So  starting with the political philosophy. Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers. Of course we don't. But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy that are really relevant to this whole debate. The first is this  We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives  if you give people more choice  if you put them in the driving seat  then actually  you can create a stronger and better society. And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today  I think you can completely  as I've said  remake politics  remake government  remake your public services. The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature. Politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are  rather than as they would like them to be. Now  if you combine this very simple  very conservative thought    go with the grain of human nature    with all the advances in behavioral economics  some of which we were just hearing about  again  I think we can achieve a real increase in well being  in happiness  in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money. Now  why do I think now is the moment to make this argument  Well  I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short  condensed history lesson about what I would say are the three passages of history  the pre bureaucratic age  the bureaucratic age and what we now live in  which I think is a post bureaucratic age. A simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control  then we went to a world of central control  and now we're in a world of people control. Local power  central power  now  people power. Now  here is King Cnut  king a thousand years ago. Thought he could turn back the waves  couldn't turn back the waves. Couldn't actually turn back very much  because if you were king a thousand years ago  while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country  there wasn't much you were in charge of. You weren't in charge of policing  justice  education  health  welfare. You could just about go to war and that was about it. This was the pre bureaucratic age  an age in which everything had to be local. You had to have local control because there was no nationally available information because travel was so restricted. So this was the pre bureaucratic age. Next part of the cold history lesson  the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution. Suddenly  all sorts of transport  travel information were possible  and this gave birth to  what I like to call  the bureaucratic age. And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are. Suddenly  you have the big  strong  central state. It was able    but only it was able    to organize health care  education  policing  justice. And it was a world of  as I say  not local power  but now central power. It had sucked all that power up from the localities. It was able to do that itself. The next great stage  which all of you are so familiar with  the massive information revolution. Just consider this one fact  One hundred years ago  sending these    words cost    dollars. Right now  here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else  and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost  and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without it costing anything. So we're now living in a post bureaucratic age  where genuine people power is possible. Now  what does this mean for our politics  for our public services  for our government  Well I can't  in the time I've got  give huge numbers of examples  but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change. And this is so obvious  in a way  because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop  the way we travel  the way that business is done. That is already happened  the information and Internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways  but it hasn't  in every way  yet touched our government. So  how could this happen  Well  I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference  in transparency  in greater choice and in accountability  in giving us that genuine people power. If we take transparency  here is one of my favorite websites  the Missouri Accountability Portal. In the old days  only the government could hold the information  and only a few elected people could try and grab that information and question it and challenge it. Now here  on one website  one state in America  every single dollar spent by that government is searchable  is analyzable  is checkable. Think of the huge change that means  Any business that wants to bid for a government contract can see what currently is being spent. Anyone thinking   I could do that service better  I could deliver it cheaper   it's all available there. We have only  in government and in politics  started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution. So  complete transparency will make a huge difference. In this country  if we win the election  we are going to make all government spending over        pounds transparent and available online  searchable for anyone to see. We're going to make every contract    we're announcing this today    available on the Internet so anyone can see what the terms are  what the conditions are  driving huge value for money  but also huge increases  I believe  in well being as well. Choice. Now you all shop online  compare online  do everything online  and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education  or health care or policing  and you're going to see this change massively. We should be making this change with the information revolution in our country  with searchable health sites  so you can see what operations work out properly  what records doctors have  the cleanliness of hospitals  who does best at infection control    all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health is now available for all of us to see. And the third of these big changes  accountability. This  I think  is a huge change. It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago. So  instead of having a situation where only the police have the information about which crimes are committed where  and we have to employ people in government to try and hold the police to account  suddenly  we've got this vast opportunity for people power  where we  as citizens  can see what crimes are being committed    where  when and by whom    and we can hold the police to account. And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat  but actually that's an assault  the one in blue. You can see what crime is committed where  and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account. So those three ways    transparency  accountability and choice    will make a huge difference. Now I also said the other principle that I think we should work on is understanding of people  is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more. Now  we're got a huge revolution in understanding of why people behave in the way that they do  and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use. We're working with some of these people. We're being advised by some of these people  as was said  to try and bring all the experience to book. Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple  and I love. We want to get people to be more energy efficient. Why  It cuts fuel poverty  it cuts their bills  and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time. How do you do it  Well  we've had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home. We even had    one government minister once told us to brush our teeth in the dark. I don't think they lasted very long. Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics. The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending  to show them what their neighbors are spending  and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending. That sort of behavioral economics can transform people's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve. Other examples are recycling. We all know we need to recycle more. How do we make it happen  All the proof from America is that actually  if you pay people to recycle  if you give them a carrot rather than a stick  you can transform their behavior. So what does all this add up to  Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last    years. Obviously  here we have JFK with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation   Ask not what your country can do for you  ask what you can do for your country   an incredibly noble sentiment. But when he made that speech  what could you do to build the stronger  better society  You could fight for your country  you could die for your country  you could serve in your country's civil service  but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now. And I think an even more wonderful speech  which I'm going to read a big chunk of  which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money  and more that we should try and measure than money. And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little  It  does not allow for the health of our children  the quality of their education  or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages  the intelligence of our public debate. It measures neither our wit nor our courage  neither our wisdom nor our learning  neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything  in short  except that which makes life worthwhile.  Again  a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put    years ago  and a beautiful dream    years ago  but now with the huge advances in information technology  with the massive changes in behavioral economics  with all that we know about how you advance well being  that if we combine those insights of giving power to people  and using information to make that possible  and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature  while at the same time  understanding why people behave in the way they do  it is a dream more easy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech    years ago. Thank you. I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired. I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything  but I'd already finished editing the piece  and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word  disabled  to see what I'd find. Let me read you the entry.  Disabled  adjective  crippled  helpless  useless  wrecked  stalled  maimed  wounded  mangled  lame  mutilated  run down  worn out  weakened  impotent  castrated  paralyzed  handicapped  senile  decrepit  laid up  done up  done for  done in cracked up  counted out  see also hurt  useless and weak. Antonyms  healthy  strong  capable.  I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing  it was so ludicrous  but I'd just gotten past  mangled   and my voice broke  and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed. You know  of course  this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date  right  But  in fact  the print date was the early     s  when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me. And  needless to say  thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then. I mean  from this entry  it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them  when in fact  today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured. So  I immediately went to look up the      online edition  expecting to find a revision worth noting. Here's the updated version of this entry. Unfortunately  it's not much better. I find the last two words under  Near Antonyms   particularly unsettling   whole  and  wholesome.  So  it's not just about the words. It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words. It's about the values behind the words  and how we construct those values. Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people. In fact  many ancient societies  including the Greeks and the Romans  believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful  because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence. So  what reality do we want to call into existence  a person who is limited  or a person who's empowered  By casually doing something as simple as naming a person  a child  we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power. Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead  One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington  Delaware. His name was Dr. Pizzutillo  an Italian American  whose name  apparently  was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce  so he went by Dr. P. And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children. I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital  with the exception of my physical therapy sessions. I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick  elastic bands    different colors  you know    to help build up my leg muscles  and I hated these bands more than anything    I hated them  had names for them. I hated them. And  you know  I was already bargaining  as a five year old child  with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises  unsuccessfully  of course. And  one day  he came in to my session    exhaustive and unforgiving  these sessions    and he said to me   Wow. Aimee  you are such a strong and powerful little girl  I think you're going to break one of those bands. When you do break it  I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.  Now  of course  this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward  but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me. And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong  powerful and athletic person well into the future. This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child. But  in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries  our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want  the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable. Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society  many of which have been brought about by technology. Certainly  from a medical standpoint  my legs  laser surgery for vision impairment  titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities  and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them    not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify  to claim their own descriptions of themselves  so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing. So  perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth  that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society  and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. The human ability to adapt  it's an interesting thing  because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity  and I'm going to make an admission  This phrase never sat right with me  and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it  and I think I'm starting to figure out why. Implicit in this phrase of  overcoming adversity  is the idea that success  or happiness  is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience  as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics  or what other people perceive as my disability. But  in fact  we are changed. We are marked  of course  by a challenge  whether physically  emotionally or both. And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing. Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life. It's part of our life. And I tend to think of it like my shadow. Sometimes I see a lot of it  sometimes there's very little  but it's always with me. And  certainly  I'm not trying to diminish the impact  the weight  of a person's struggle. There is adversity and challenge in life  and it's all very real and relative to every single person  but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity  but how you're going to meet it. So  our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity  but preparing them to meet it well. And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt. There's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled. And  truthfully  the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions. In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold  hard truth about their medical prognosis  or  indeed  a prognosis on the expected quality of their life  we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone. Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it  serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself. By not treating the wholeness of a person  by not acknowledging their potency  we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have. We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community. So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability. And  most importantly  there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability. So it's not about devaluing  or negating  these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug  but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity. So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it  embracing it  grappling with it  to use a wrestling term  maybe even dancing with it. And  perhaps  if we see adversity as natural  consistent and useful  we're less burdened by the presence of it. This year we celebrate the    th birthday of Charles Darwin  and it was     years ago  when writing about evolution  that Darwin illustrated  I think  a truth about the human character. To paraphrase  It's not the strongest of the species that survives  nor is it the most intelligent that survives  it is the one that is most adaptable to change. Conflict is the genesis of creation. From Darwin's work  amongst others  we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation. So  again  transformation  adaptation  is our greatest human skill. And  perhaps  until we're tested  we don't know what we're made of. Maybe that's what adversity gives us  a sense of self  a sense of our own power. So  we can give ourselves a gift. We can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times. Maybe we can see it as change. Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet. I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy. Now  who's normal  There's no normal. There's common  there's typical. There's no normal  and would you want to meet that poor  beige person if they existed  I don't think so. If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility    or potency  to be even a little bit more dangerous    we can release the power of so many more children  and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community. Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use  to be able to contribute. There's evidence that Neanderthals         years ago  carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury  and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community. They didn't view these people as broken and useless  they were seen as rare and valuable. A few years ago  I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania  and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. It was summertime  I had shorts on. I hear this guy  his voice behind me say   Well  if it isn't Aimee Mullins.  And I turn around  and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is. And I said   I'm sorry  sir  have we met  I don't remember meeting you.  He said   Well  you wouldn't remember meeting me. I mean  when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb.  Oh  that guy. And  but of course  actually  it did click. This man was Dr. Kean  a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day  because  of course  typical fashion  I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks. And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation  so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents. And  because I was born without the fibula bones  and had feet turned in  and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that  he had to be the bearer    this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news. He said to me   I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk  and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence  and you've been making liar out of me ever since.  The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood  whether winning a second grade spelling bee  marching with the Girl Scouts  you know  the Halloween parade  winning my college scholarship  or any of my sports victories  and he was using it  and integrating it into teaching resident students  med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School. And he called this part of the course the X Factor  the potential of the human will. No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone's life. And Dr. Kean went on to tell me  he said   In my experience  unless repeatedly told otherwise  and even if given a modicum of support  if left to their own devices  a child will achieve.  See  Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking. He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it. And there's been a shift in my thinking over time  in that  if you had asked me at    years old  if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs  I wouldn't have hesitated for a second. I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then. But if you ask me today  I'm not so sure. And it's because of the experiences I've had with them  not in spite of the experiences I've had with them. And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me. See  all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power  and you're off. If you can hand somebody the key to their own power    the human spirit is so receptive    if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment  you are educating them in the best sense. You're teaching them to open doors for themselves. In fact  the exact meaning of the word  educate  comes from the root word  educe.  It means  to bring forth what is within  to bring out potential.  So again  which potential do we want to bring out  There was a case study done in     s Britain  when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools. It's called the streaming trials. We call it  tracking  here in the States. It's separating students from A  B  C  D and so on. And the  A students  get the tougher curriculum  the best teachers  etc. Well  they took  over a three month period  D level students  gave them A's  told them they were  A's   told them they were bright  and at the end of this three month period  they were performing at A level. And  of course  the heartbreaking  flip side of this study  is that they took the  A students  and told them they were  D's.  And that's what happened at the end of that three month period. Those who were still around in school  besides the people who had dropped out. A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too. The teachers didn't know a switch had been made. They were simply told   These are the 'A students ' these are the 'D students.'  And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them. So  I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit  a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope  it doesn't see beauty  it no longer has our natural  childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine. If instead  we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope  to see beauty in themselves and others  to be curious and imaginative  then we are truly using our power well. When a spirit has those qualities  we are able to create new realities and new ways of being. I'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend  Jacques Dembois told me about  and the poem is called  The God Who Only Knows Four Words    Every child has known God  not the God of names  not the God of don'ts  but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them  saying  'Come dance with me. Come  dance with me. Come  dance with me.'  Thank you. I'm going to talk today about energy and climate. And that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds  about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. But energy and climate are extremely important to these people    in fact  more important than to anyone else on the planet. The climate getting worse means that many years  their crops won't grow  There will be too much rain  not enough rain  things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support. And that leads to starvation  it leads to uncertainty  it leads to unrest. So  the climate changes will be terrible for them. Also  the price of energy is very important to them. In fact  if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of  to reduce poverty  by far you would pick energy. Now  the price of energy has come down over time. Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution  and  even in the     s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity  and that's why we have refrigerators  air conditioning  we can make modern materials and do so many things. And so  we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. But  as we make it cheaper    and let's go for making it twice as cheap    we need to meet a new constraint  and that constraint has to do with CO . CO  is warming the planet  and the equation on CO  is actually a very straightforward one. If you sum up the CO  that gets emitted  that leads to a temperature increase  and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects  the effects on the weather  perhaps worse  the indirect effects  in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes  and so you get ecosystem collapses. Now  the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO  to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are  there's some uncertainty there  but not very much. And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be  but they will be extremely bad. I asked the top scientists on this several times  Do we really have to get down to near zero  Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter  And the answer is that until we get near to zero  the temperature will continue to rise. And so that's a big challenge. It's very different than saying  We're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge  and we can just sort of squeeze under.  This is something that has to get to zero. Now  we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year  over    billion tons. For each American  it's about    tons  for people in poor countries  it's less than one ton. It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. And  somehow  we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. It's been constantly going up. It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all  so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling  and falling all the way to zero. This equation has four factors  a little bit of multiplication  So  you've got a thing on the left  CO   that you want to get to zero  and that's going to be based on the number of people  the services each person's using on average  the energy on average for each service  and the CO  being put out per unit of energy. So  let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably  one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. Now that's back from high school algebra  but let's take a look. First  we've got population. The world today has  .  billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now  if we do a really great job on new vaccines  health care  reproductive health services  we could lower that by  perhaps     or    percent  but there we see an increase of about  . . The second factor is the services we use. This encompasses everything  the food we eat  clothing  TV  heating. These are very good things  getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. And it's a great thing for this number to go up. In the rich world  perhaps the top one billion  we probably could cut back and use less  but every year  this number  on average  is going to go up  and so  over all  that will more than double the services delivered per person. Here we have a very basic service  Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework  And  in fact  these kids don't  so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps. Now  efficiency  E  the energy for each service  here finally we have some good news. We have something that's not going up. Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting  through different types of cars  different ways of building buildings    there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially. Some individual services even bring it down by    percent. There are other services like how we make fertilizer  or how we do air transport  where the rooms for improvement are far  far less. And so  overall here  if we're optimistic  we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even  perhaps  a factor of six. But for these first three factors now  we've gone from    billion to  at best  maybe    billion tons  and that just won't cut it. So let's look at this fourth factor    this is going to be a key one    and this is the amount of CO  put out per each unit of energy. And so the question is  Can you actually get that to zero  If you burn coal  no. If you burn natural gas  no. Almost every way we make electricity today  except for the emerging renewables and nuclear  puts out CO . And so  what we're going to have to do at a global scale  is create a new system. And so  we need energy miracles. Now  when I use the term  miracle   I don't mean something that's impossible. The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. The Internet and its services are a miracle. So  the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. Usually  we don't have a deadline  where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. Usually  you just kind of stand by  and some come along  some don't. This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline. Now  I thought   How could I really capture this  Is there some kind of natural illustration  some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here   I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos  and somehow people enjoyed that. It really got them involved in the idea of  you know  there are people who live with mosquitos. So  with energy  all I could come up with is this. I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. So here we have some natural fireflies. I'm told they don't bite  in fact  they might not even leave that jar. Now  there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one  but they don't really add up to much. We need solutions    either one or several    that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability  and  although there's many directions people are seeking  I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. I've left out tide  geothermal  fusion  biofuels. Those may make some contribution  and if they can do better than I expect  so much the better  but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five  and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting  because they all have significant challenges. Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels  either burning coal or burning natural gas. What you need to do there  seems like it might be simple  but it's not  and that's to take all the CO   after you've burned it  going out the flue  pressurize it  create a liquid  put it somewhere  and hope it stays there. Now we have some pilot things that do this at the    to    percent level  but getting up to that full percentage  that will be very tricky  and agreeing on where these CO  quantities should be put will be hard  but the toughest one here is this long term issue. Who's going to be sure  Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things  This is a lot of volume. So that's a tough one. Next would be nuclear. It also has three big problems  Cost  particularly in highly regulated countries  is high  the issue of the safety  really feeling good about nothing could go wrong  that  even though you have these human operators  that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. And then what do you do with the waste  And  although it's not very large  there are a lot of concerns about that. People need to feel good about it. So three very tough problems that might be solvable  and so  should be worked on. The last three of the five  I've grouped together. These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. And they actually    although it's great they don't require fuel    they have some disadvantages. One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. This is energy farming  so you're talking about many square miles  thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. Also  these are intermittent sources. The sun doesn't shine all day  it doesn't shine every day  and  likewise  the wind doesn't blow all the time. And so  if you depend on these sources  you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available. So  we've got big cost challenges here  we have transmission challenges  for example  say this energy source is outside your country  you not only need the technology  but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere. And  finally  this storage problem. And  to dimensionalize this  I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made    for cars  for computers  for phones  for flashlights  for everything    and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses  and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than    minutes of all the energy. And so  in fact  we need a big breakthrough here  something that's going to be a factor of     better than the approaches we have now. It's not impossible  but it's not a very easy thing. Now  this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above  say     to    percent of what you're using. If you're counting on it for     percent  you need an incredible miracle battery. Now  how we're going to go forward on this    what's the right approach  Is it a Manhattan Project  What's the thing that can get us there  Well  we need lots of companies working on this  hundreds. In each of these five paths  we need at least a hundred people. And a lot of them  you'll look at and say   They're crazy.  That's good. And  I think  here in the TED group  we have many people who are already pursuing this. Bill Gross has several companies  including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities  and I'm trying to help back that. Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that  perhaps surprisingly  is actually taking the nuclear approach. There are some innovations in nuclear  modular  liquid. And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago  so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. The idea of TerraPower is that  instead of burning a part of uranium    the one percent  which is the U       we decided   Let's burn the    percent  the U   .  It is kind of a crazy idea. In fact  people had talked about it for a long time  but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not  and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that  yes  with the right material's approach  this looks like it would work. And  because you're burning that    percent  you have greatly improved cost profile. You actually burn up the waste  and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. So  instead of worrying about them  you just take that. It's a great thing. It breathes this uranium as it goes along  so it's kind of like a candle. You can see it's a log there  often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. In terms of fuel  this really solves the problem. I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. This is the leftover  the    percent  where they've taken out the part they burn now  so it's called depleted uranium. That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years. And  simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process  you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet. So  you know  it's got lots of challenges ahead  but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. So let's think  How should we measure ourselves  What should our report card look like  Well  let's go out to where we really need to get  and then look at the intermediate. For       you've heard many people talk about this    percent reduction. That really is very important  that we get there. And that    percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries  still some agriculture  hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry  cement. So  to get to that    percent  the developed countries  including countries like China  will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. So  the other grade is  Are we deploying this zero emission technology  have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere  That's super important. That's a key element of making that report card. So  backing up from there  what should the      report card look like  Well  again  it should have the two elements. We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions  The less we emit  the less that sum will be of CO   and  therefore  the less the temperature. But in some ways  the grade we get there  doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions  is only equally  or maybe even slightly less  important than the other  which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs. These breakthroughs  we need to move those at full speed  and we can measure that in terms of companies  pilot projects  regulatory things that have been changed. There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. The Al Gore book   Our Choice  and the David McKay book   Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.  They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly  because we need broad backing for this. There's a lot that has to come together. So this is a wish. It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish for the next    years    I could pick who's president  I could pick a vaccine  which is something I love  or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO  gets invented    this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don't get this wish  the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible  between the U.S. and China  between poor countries and rich  and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse. So  what do we have to do  What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive  We need to go for more research funding. When countries get together in places like Copenhagen  they shouldn't just discuss the CO . They should discuss this innovation agenda  and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. We do need the market incentives    CO  tax  cap and trade    something that gets that price signal out there. We need to get the message out. We need to have this dialogue be a more rational  more understandable dialogue  including the steps that the government takes. This is an important wish  but it is one I think we can achieve. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower  right    I mean  first of all  can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is  Bil Gates  To actually do the software  buy the supercomputer  hire all the great scientists  which we've done  that's only tens of millions  and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly  then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. The tough thing is building the pilot reactor  finding the several billion  finding the regulator  the location that will actually build the first one of these. Once you get the first one built  if it works as advertised  then it's just clear as day  because the economics  the energy density  are so different than nuclear as we know it. CA  And so  to understand it right  this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel  of this sort of spent uranium  and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down  BG  That's right. Today  you're always refueling the reactor  so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong  that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out  that's not good. So  if you have very cheap fuel that you can put    years in    just think of it as a log    put it down and not have those same complexities. And it just sits there and burns for the    years  and then it's done. CA  It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. BG  Yeah. Well  what happens with the waste  you can let it sit there    there's a lot less waste under this approach    then you can actually take that  and put it into another one and burn that. And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today  that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors    that's our fuel to begin with. So  the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours  and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process. CA  I mean  you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here. Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this  BG  Well  we haven't picked a particular place  and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called  nuclear   so we've got a lot of interest  that people from the company have been in Russia  India  China    I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here  talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. So I'm optimistic. You know  the French and Japanese have done some work. This is a variant on something that has been done. It's an important advance  but it's like a fast reactor  and a lot of countries have built them  so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. CA  So  in your mind  timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live  BG  Well  we need    for one of these high scale  electro generation things that's very cheap  we have    years to invent and then    years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. And  you know  TerraPower  if things go well    which is wishing for a lot    could easily meet that. And there are  fortunately now  dozens of companies    we need it to be hundreds    who  likewise  if their science goes well  if the funding for their pilot plants goes well  that they can compete for this. And it's best if multiple succeed  because then you could use a mix of these things. We certainly need one to succeed. CA  In terms of big scale possible game changes  is this the biggest that you're aware of out there  BG  An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. It would have been  even without the environmental constraint  but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. In the nuclear space  there are other innovators. You know  we don't know their work as well as we know this one  but the modular people  that's a different approach. There's a liquid type reactor  which seems a little hard  but maybe they say that about us. And so  there are different ones  but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of  say  coal  and so    if you can deal with the negatives  which are essentially the radiation    the footprint and cost  the potential  in terms of effect on land and various things  is almost in a class of its own. CA  If this doesn't work  then what  Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable  BG  If you get into that situation  it's like if you've been over eating  and you're about to have a heart attack  Then where do you go  You may need heart surgery or something. There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering  which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us    or    years to get our act together. Now  that's just an insurance policy. You hope you don't need to do that. Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy  that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. I'm not sure that's wise  given the importance of the problem  but there's now the geoengineering discussion about    should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster  or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect  CA  Climate skeptics  If you had a sentence or two to say to them  how might you persuade them that they're wrong  BG  Well  unfortunately  the skeptics come in different camps. The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things  There are very  very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. The main problem we have here  it's kind of like AIDS. You make the mistake now  and you pay for it a lot later. And so  when you have all sorts of urgent problems  the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later  and a somewhat uncertain pain thing    in fact  the IPCC report  that's not necessarily the worst case  and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say   OK  that isn't that big of a deal.  The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. But my dream here is that  if you can make it economic  and meet the CO  constraints  then the skeptics say   OK  I don't care that it doesn't put out CO   I kind of wish it did put out CO   but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before.  CA  And so  that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument  that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO  problem  it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth  it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. BG  Well  the actual spending on the R D piece    say the U.S. should spend    billion a year more than it is right now    it's not that dramatic. It shouldn't take away from other things. The thing you get into big money on  and this  reasonable people can disagree  is when you have something that's non economic and you're trying to fund that    that  to me  mostly is a waste. Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap  I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. If the trade off you get into is   Let's make energy super expensive   then the rich can afford that. I mean  all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. The disaster is for that two billion. And even Lomborg has changed. His shtick now is   Why isn't the R D getting more discussed   He's still  because of his earlier stuff  still associated with the skeptic camp  but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp  and so  he's making the R D point. And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. The R D piece  it's crazy how little it's funded. CA  Well Bill  I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much. BG  Thank you. I want to talk about my investigations into what technology means in our lives    not just our immediate life  but in the cosmic sense  in the kind of long history of the world and our place in the world  What is this stuff  What is the significance  And so  I want to kind of go through my little story of what I found out. And one of the first things that I started to investigate was the history of the name of technology. And in the United States there is a State of the Union address given by every president since     . And each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the United States at that time. If you search for the word  technology   it was not used until     . So  technology was sort of absent from everybody's thinking until       which happened to be the year of my birth. And obviously  technology had existed before then  but we weren't aware of it  and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life. I actually did research to find out the first use of the word  technology.  It was in       and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum    a course  bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts  and industry    and he called it  Technology.  And that's the very first use of the word. So  what is this stuff that we're all consumed by  and bothered by  Alan Kay calls it   Technology is anything that was invented after you were born.  Which is sort of the idea that we normally have about what technology is  It's all that new stuff. It's not roads  or penicillin  or factory tires  it's the new stuff. My friend Danny Hillis says kind of a similar one  he says   Technology is anything that doesn't work yet.  Which is  again  a sense that it's all new. But we know that it's just not new. It actually goes way back  and what I want to suggest is it goes a long way back. So  another way to think about technology  what it means  is to imagine a world without technology. If we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today    and I mean everything  from blades to scrapers to cloth    we as a species would not live very long. We would die by the billions  and very quickly  The wolves would get us  we would be defenseless  we would be unable to grow enough food  or find enough food. Even the hunter gatherers used some elementary tools. And so  they had minimal technology  but they had some technology. And if we study those hunter gatherer tribes and the Neanderthal  which are very similar to early man  we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology  and this is a kind of a curve of their average age. There are no Neanderthal fossils that are older than    years old that we've ever found  and the average age of most of these hunter gatherer tribes is    to   . There are very few young infants because they die    high mortality rate    and there's very few old people. And so the profile is sort of for your average San Francisco neighborhood  a lot of young people. And if you go there  you say   Hey  everybody's really healthy.  Well  that's because they're all young. And the same thing with the hunter gatherer tribes and early man is that you didn't live beyond the age of   . So  it was a world without grandparents. And grandparents are very important  because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information. Imagine a world and basically everybody was    to    years old. How much learning can you do  You can't do very much learning in your own life  it's so short  and there's nobody to pass on what you do learn. So  that's one aspect. It was a very short life. But at the same time anthropologists know that most hunter gatherer tribes of the world  with that very little technology  actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food that they needed  three to six hours a day. Some anthropologists call that the original affluent society. Because they had banker hours basically. So  it was possible to get enough food. But when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came  then people went into starvation. And that's why they didn't live very long. So  what technology brought  through the very simple tools like these stone tools here    even something as small as this    the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about     megafauna animals in North America when they first arrived        years ago. So  long before the industrial age we've been affecting the planet on a global scale  with just a small amount of technology. The other thing that the early man invented was fire. And fire was used to clear out  and again  affected the ecology of grass and whole continents  and was used in cooking. It enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things. It was sort of  in a certain sense  in a McLuhan sense  an external stomach  in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise. And if we don't have fire  we actually could not live. Our bodies have adapted to these new diets. Our bodies have changed in the last        years. So  with that little bit of technology  humans went from a small band of        or so    the same number as Neanderthals everywhere    and we suddenly exploded. With the invention of language around        years ago  the number of humans exploded  and very quickly became the dominant species on the planet. And they migrated into the rest of the world at two kilometers per year until  within several tens of thousands of years  we occupied every single watershed on the planet and became the most dominant species  with a very small amount of technology. And even at that time  with the introduction of agriculture                years ago we started to see climate change. So  climate change is not a new thing. What's new is just the degree of it. Even during the agricultural age there was climate change. And so  already small amounts of technology were transforming the world. And what this means  and where I'm going  is that technology has become the most powerful force in the world. All the things that we see today that are changing our lives  we can always trace back to the introduction of some new technology. So  it's a force that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet  and in such a degree that I think that it's become our    who we are. In fact  our humanity  and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we've invented. So  we've invented ourselves. Of all the animals that we have domesticated  the most important animal that we've domesticated has been us. Okay  So  humanity is our greatest invention. But of course we're not done yet. We're still inventing  and this is what technology is allowing us to do    it's continually to reinvent ourselves. It's a very  very strong force. I call this entire thing    us humans as our technology  everything that we've made  gadgets in our lives    we call that the technium. That's this world. My working definition of technology is  anything useful that a human mind makes.  It's not just hammers and gadgets  like laptops. But it's also law. And of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us. While this is something that comes from our mind  it also has its roots deeply into the cosmos. It goes back. The origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang  in this way  in that they are part of this self organizing thread that starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars  into life  into us. And the three major phases of the early universe was energy  when the dominant force was energy  then it became  the dominant force  as it cooled  became matter  and then  with the invention of life  four billion years ago  the dominant force in our neighborhood became information. That's what life is  It's an information process that was restructuring and making new order. So  those energy  matter Einstein show were equivalent  and now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information and matter and energy are all interrelated  so it's one long continuum. You put energy into the right kind of system and out comes wasted heat  entropy and extropy  which is order. It's the increased order. Where does this order come from  Its roots go way back. We actually don't know. But we do know that the self organization trend throughout the universe is long  and it began with things like galaxies  they maintained their order for billions of years. Stars are basically nuclear fusion machines that self organize and self sustain themselves for billions of years  this order against the entropy of the world. And flowers and plants are the same thing  extended  and technology is basically an extension of life. One trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this  is actually increasing. The amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence. And that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life is actually greater than a star    because of the star's long lifespan  the energy density in life is actually higher than a star. And the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a PC chip. There is more energy flowing through  per gram per second  than anything that we have any other experience with. What I would suggest is that if you want to see where technology is going  we continue that trajectory  and we say  Well what's going to become more energy dense  that's where it's going.  And so what I've done is  I've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say   What are the general trends in evolutionary life   And there are things moving towards greater complexity  moving towards greater diversity  moving towards greater specialization  sentience  ubiquity and most important  evolvability  Those very same things are also present in technology. That's where technology is going. In fact  technology is accelerating all the aspects of life  and we can see that happening  just as there's diversity in life  there's more diversity in things we make. Things in life start out being general cell  and they become specialized  You have tissue cells  you have muscle  brain cells. And same things happens with say  a hammer  which is general at first and becomes more specific. So  I would like to say that while there is six kingdoms of life  we can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life. It's a branching off from the human form. But technology has its own agenda  like anything  like life itself. For instance  right now  three quarters of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself. In transportation  it's not to move us  it's to move the stuff that we make or buy. I use the word  want.  Technology wants. This is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power. Your cat wants more food. A bacterium  which has no consciousness at all  wants to move towards light. It has an urge  and technology has an urge. At the same time  it wants to give us things  and what it gives us is basically progress. You can take all kinds of curves  and they're all pointing up. There's really no dispute about progress  if we discount the cost of that. And that's the thing that bothers most people  is that progress is really real  but we wonder and question  What are the environmental costs of it  I did a survey of a number of species of artifacts in my house  and there's      . Other people have come up with       . When King Henry of England died  he had        things in his house  but that was the entire wealth of England. And with that entire wealth of England  King Henry could not buy any antibiotics  he could not buy refrigeration  he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles. Whereas this rickshaw wale in India could save up and buy antibiotics and he could buy refrigeration. He could buy things that King Henry  in all his wealth  could never buy. That's what progress is about. So  technology is selfish  technology is generous. That conflict  that tension  will be with us forever  that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do  and sometimes it's going to do things for us. We have confusion about what we should think about a new technology. Right now the default position about when a new technology comes along  is we    people talk about the precautionary principle  which is very common in Europe  which says  basically   Don't do anything. When you meet a new technology  stop  until it can be proven that there's no harm.  I think that really leads nowhere. But a better way is to  what I call proactionary principle  which is  You engage with technology. You try it out. You obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests  you try to anticipate it  but after anticipating it  you constantly asses it  not just once  but eternally. And when it diverts from what you want  we prioritize risk  we evaluate not just the new stuff  but the old stuff. We fix it  but most importantly  we relocate it. And what I mean by that is that we find a new job for it. Nuclear energy  fission  is really bad idea for bombs. But it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy for electricity  instead of burning coal. When we have a bad idea  the response to a bad idea is not no ideas  it's not to stop thinking. The response to a bad idea    like  say  a tungsten light bulb    is a better idea. OK  So  better ideas is really    always the response to technology that we don't like is basically  better technology. And actually  in a certain sense  technology is a kind of a method for generating better ideas  if you can think about it that way. So  maybe spraying DDT on crops is a really bad idea. But DDT sprayed on local homes  there's nothing better to eliminate malaria  besides insect DDT impregnated mosquito nets. But that's a really good idea  that's a good job for technology. So  our job as humans is to parent our mind children  to find them good friends  to find them a good job. And so  every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job. That's actually my son  right here. There are no bad technologies  just as there are no bad children. We don't say children are neutral  children are positive. We just have to find them the right place. And so  what technology gives us  over the long term  over the sort of extended evolution    from the beginning of time  through the invention of the plants and animals  and the evolution of life  the evolution of brains    what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences  It's increasing diversity  it's increasing options  it's increasing choices  opportunities  possibilities and freedoms. That's what we get from technology all the time. That's why people leave villages and go into cities  is because they are always gravitating towards increased choices and possibilities. And we are aware of the price. We pay a price for that  but we are aware of it  and generally we will pay the price for increased freedoms  choices and opportunities. Even technology wants clean water. Is technology diametrically opposed to nature  Because technology is an extension of life  it's in parallel and aligned with the same things that life wants. So that I think technology loves biology  if we allow it to. Great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go  and our choice  so to speak  in technology  is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves. So  technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket. It's more than just gadgets  it's more than just things that people invent. It's actually part of a very long story  a great story  that began billions of years ago. And it's moving through us  this self organization  and we're extending and accelerating it  and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it. I really appreciate your attention today. Thank you. I've always been interested in the relationship of formal structures and human behavior. If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town  people will move there. Well  law is also a powerful driver of human behavior. And what I'd like to discuss today is the need to overhaul and simplify the law to release the energy and passion of Americans  so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society. You might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two. If you run a business  it's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel. Indeed  there is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs. It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. You need a lawyer to run the company  because there's so much law. But it's not just business that's affected by this  it's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people. A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody  Wyoming. It was in a grizzly bear preserve  although no one told me that before we went. And our guide was a local science teacher. She was wholly unconcerned about the bears  but she was terrified of lawyers. The stories started pouring out. She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by    percent when he turned the paper in late. The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings. So  she had to go to meeting after meeting  same arguments made over and over again. After    days of sleepless nights  she finally capitulated and raised the grade. She said   Life's too short  I just can't keep going with this.  About the same time  she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in Laramie  which is a couple of hours away  and she was going to drive them in her car  but the school said   No  you can't drive them in the car for liability reasons. You have to go in a school bus.  So  they provided a bus that held    people and drove the three of them back and forth several hours to Laramie. Her husband is also a science teacher  and he takes his biology class on a hike in the nearby national park. But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled  so the other    students didn't get to go on the hike either. At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher. Now  we've been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom. But somehow or another  in the last couple of decades  the land of the free has become a legal minefield. It's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible  and yet  when you pull back  you see it all the time. It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a pediatrician friend in North Carolina. He said   Well you know  I don't deal with patients the same way anymore. You wouldn't want to say something off the cuff that might be used against you.  This is a doctor  whose life is caring for people. My own law firm has a list of questions that I'm not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates  such as the sinister question  bulging with hidden motives and innuendo   Where are you from   Now for    years  tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control. And we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits  like the guy in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for    million dollars because they lost his pair of pants. The case went on for two years  I think he's still appealing the case. But the reality is  these crazy cases are relatively rare. They don't usually win. And the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent  which is twice as much as in other countries but  as taxes go  hardly crippling. But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg. What's happened here  again  almost without our knowing  is our culture has changed. People no longer feel free to act on their best judgment. So  what do we do about it  We certainly don't want to give up the rights  when people do something wrong  to seek redress in the courts. We need regulation to make sure people don't pollute and such. We lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem  and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference. We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute  every issue  is a matter of kind of individual rights. And so we peer through a legal microscope  and look at everything. Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances that explain why Johnny turned his paper in late in Cody  Wyoming  Is it possible that the doctor might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker  And of course the hindsight bias is perfect. There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out where it's possible that something could have been done differently. And yet  we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope  hoping that we can judge any dispute against the standard of a perfect society  where everyone will agree what's fair  and where accidents will be extinct  risk will be no more. Of course  this is Utopia  it's a formula for paralysis  not freedom. It's not the basis of the rule of law  it's not the basis of a free society. So  now I have the first of four propositions I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law  You've got to judge law mainly by its effect on the broader society  not individual disputes. Absolutely vital. So  let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above. Is it working  What does the macro data show us  Well  the healthcare system has been transformed  a culture pervaded with defensiveness  universal distrust of the system of justice  universal practice of defensive medicine. It's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives. Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes  and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong. But reliable estimates range between    billion and     billion dollars per year. That's enough to provide care to all the people in America who don't have it. The trial lawyers say   Well  this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine.  Well that's been studied too  by the Institute of Medicine and others. Turns out that's not the case. The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up   Are you sure that's the right dosage   Because they're not sure  and they don't want to take legal responsibility. Let's go to schools. As we saw with the teacher in Cody  Wyoming  she seems to be affected by the law. Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law. You could have a separate section of a law library around each of the following legal concepts  due process  special education  no child left behind  zero tolerance  work rules ... it goes on. We did a study of all the rules that affect one school in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea. Tens of thousands of discreet rules     steps to suspend a student from school  It's a formula for paralysis. What's the effect of that  One is a decline in order. Again  studies have shown it's directly attributable to the rise of due process. Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that    percent of the high school teachers in America say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom. That means those students are getting half the learning they're supposed to  because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn. And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order  They're threatened with a legal claim. We also surveyed that. Seventy eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in America have been threatened by their students with violating their rights  with lawsuits by their students. They are threatening  their students. It's not that they usually sue  it's not that they would win  but it's an indication of the corrosion of authority. And how has this system of law worked for government  It doesn't seem to be working very well does it  Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington. The other day at the State of the Union speech  President Obama said  and I think we could all agree with this goal   From the first railroads to the interstate highway system  our nation has always been the first to compete. There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains.  Well  actually there is a reason  Environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project taking the better part of a decade  then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn't like the project. Then  just staying above the Earth for one more second  people are acting like idiots  all across the country. Idiots. A couple of years ago  Broward County  Florida  banned running at recess. That means all the boys are going to be ADD. I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure. My favorite  though  are all the warning labels.  Caution  Contents are hot   on billions of coffee cups. Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff  but they'll see all these labels   Contents are extremely hot.  They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac. That's the only explanation. Because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot  My favorite warning was one on a five inch fishing lure. I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing. Five inch fishing lure  it's a big fishing lure  with a three pronged hook in the back  and outside it said   Harmful if swallowed.  So  none of these people are doing what they think is right. And why not  They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law  Because it gives us the worst of both worlds  It's random    anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury  not even an effort at consistency    and it's also too detailed. In the areas that are regulated  there are so many rules no human could possibly know it. Well how do you fix it  We could spend        lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle. But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law  because the hurdle for success is trust. People    for law to be the platform for freedom  people have to trust it. So  that's my second proposition  Trust is an essential condition to a free society. Life is complicated enough without legal fear. But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties  because it carries with it the power of state. And so the state can come in. It actually changes the way people think. It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long  whispering in your ear   Could that go wrong  Might that go wrong   It drives people from the smart part of the brain    that dark  deep well of the subconscious  where instincts and experience  and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are    it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic. Pretty soon the doctor's saying   Well  I doubt if that headache could be a tumor  but who would protect me if it were  So maybe I'll just order the MRI.  Then you've wasted     billion dollars in unnecessary tests. If you make people self conscious about their judgments  studies show you will make them make worse judgments. If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes when she's playing the piece  she can't play the piece. Self consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment. Edison stated it best. He said   Hell  we ain't got no rules around here  we're trying to accomplish something.  So  how do you restore trust  Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough  and tort reform  which is a great idea  lowers your cost if you're a businessperson  but it's like a Band Aid on this gaping wound of distrust. States with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies. So  what's needed is not just to limit claims  but actually create a dry ground of freedom. It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure. And it is this  Law sets boundaries  and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can't do or must do    you can't steal  you've got to pay your taxes    but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom. Isaiah Berlin put it this way   Law sets frontiers  not artificially drawn  within which men shall be inviolable.  We've forgotten that second part. Those dikes have burst. People wade through law all day long. So  what's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries. And it's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits. Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else's freedom. If someone brings a lawsuit over   A kid fell off the seesaw   it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit  all the seesaws will disappear. Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit. And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws  jungle gyms  merry go rounds  climbing ropes  nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four  because there's no risk associated with it. So  how do we rebuild it  Life is too complex for... Life is too complex for a software program. All these choices involve value judgments and social norms  not objective facts. And so here is the fourth proposition. This is what we have  the philosophy we have to change to. And there are two essential elements of it  We have to simplify the law. We have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals. The constitution is only    pages long. Worked pretty well for     years. Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices. If they can't internalize it  they won't trust it. And how do you make it simple  Because life is complex  and here is the hardest and biggest change  We have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law. We have to rehumanize the law. To make law simple so that you feel free  the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms. As you're going down  and walking down the sidewalk during the day  you have to think that if there is a dispute  there's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you're acting reasonably. That person doesn't exist today. This is the hardest hurdle. It's actually not very hard. Ninety eight percent of cases  this is a piece of cake. Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court for your lost pair of pants for       but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars. Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court. Takes five minutes. That's it  it's not that hard. But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the     s to all these really bad values  racism  gender discrimination  pollution    they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore. The problem is  we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values. It doesn't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want. They're still bounded by legal goals and principles  The teacher is accountable to the principal  the judge is accountable to an appellate court  the president is accountable to voters. But the accountability's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody  not just on the disgruntled person. You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator. So  what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy. We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy. We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom. It's not true. Authority  in fact  is essential to freedom. Law is a human institution  responsibility is a human institution. If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom  to maintain order  everybody's learning suffers. If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims  then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders. If the environmental agency can't decide that the power lines are good for the environment  then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city. A free society requires red lights and green lights  otherwise it soon descends into gridlock. That's what's happened to America. Look around. What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices. It's the only way to get our freedom back  and it's the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time. Thank you. Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented  Any guesses      . And what I can say is  in       doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes. There's a whole lot better technology coming  and that's part of the change in medicine. What has changed our society has been wireless devices. But the future are digital medical wireless devices  OK  So  let me give you some examples of this to kind of make this much more concrete. This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram. And  as a cardiologist  to think that you could see in real time a patient  an individual  anywhere in the world on your smartphone  watching your rhythm    that's incredible  and it's with us today. But that's just the beginning. You check your email while you're sitting here. In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs  all your vital signs  your heart rhythm  your blood pressure  your oxygen  your temperature  etc. This is already available today. This is AirStrip Technologies. It's now wired    or I should say  wireless    by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital  in the intensive care unit  and putting it on a smartphone for physicians. If you're an expectant parent  what about the ability to monitor  continuously  fetal heart rate  or intrauterine contractions  and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy  and moving over into the time of delivery  And then as we go further  today we have continuous glucose sensors. Right now  they are under the skin  but in the future  they won't have to be implanted. And of course  the desired range    trying to keep glucose between    and less than      checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor    you'll see how that can impact diabetes. And what about sleep  We're going to zoom in on that a little bit. We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep. What if  on your phone  which will be available in the next few weeks  you had every minute of your sleep displayed  And this is  of course  as you can see  the awake is the orange. The REM sleep  rapid eye movement  dream state  is in light green  and light is gray  light sleep  and deep sleep  the best restorative sleep  is that dark green. How about counting every calorie  And this is ability  in real time  to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure  through a Band Aid. Now  what I've talked about are physiologic metrics. But what I want to get to  the next frontier  very quickly  and why the stethoscope is on its way out  is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds  and the breath sounds  because now  introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra sound. Why is this important  Because this is so much more sensitive. Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound  and also a cardiac echo  which can be sent wireless  and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone. So  we're not just talking about physiologic metrics    the key measurements of vital signs  and all those things in physiology    but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone. Now  this is an example of another obsolete technology  soon to be buried  the Holter Monitor. Twenty four hour recording  lots of wires. This is now a little tiny patch. You can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail. Now  how does this work  Well  there is these smart Band Aids or these sensors that one would put on  on a shoe or on the wrist. And this sends a signal and it creates a body area network to a gateway. Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway  as today many of these things are dedicated gateways  because they are not so well integrated. That signal goes to the web  the cloud  and then it can be processed and sent anywhere  to a caregiver  to a physician  back to the patient  etc. So  that's basically very simplistic technology of how this works. Now  I have this device on. I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you  but I can tell you it's on. This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm  as you saw already  but it also goes well beyond that. This is me now. And you can see the ECG. Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend  to the right of that is a bioconductant. That's the fluid status  fluid status  that's really important if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure. And below that's temperature  and respiration  and oxygen  and then the position activity. So  this is really striking  because this device measures seven things that are very much vital signs for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK  And why is this important  Well  this is the most expensive bed. What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds  Well  we can. First of all  heart failure is the number one reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country. The cost of heart failure is    billion dollars a year  which is    percent related to hospitalization. And in the course of    days after a hospital stay for a Medicare greater than    years or older  is       percent are readmitted in    days  and by six months  over    percent are readmitted. So  can we improve that  Well the idea is we take this device that I'm wearing  and we put it on     patients with heart failure  randomly assigned  versus     patients who don't have active monitoring  and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions  and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial  and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that  but that's a type of wireless device trial that could change medicine in the years ahead. Why now  Why has this all of a sudden become a reality  an exciting direction in the future of medicine  What we have is  in a way  a perfect positive storm. This sets up consumer driven healthcare. That's where this is all starting. Let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you're not aware of it   .  million Americans have gotten a Nike shoe  which is a body area network that connects the shoe  the sole of the shoe to the iPhone  or an iPod. And this Wired Magazine cover article really captured a lot of this  it talked a lot about the Nike shoe and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure. Here are some things  the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind   A data driven health revolution promises to make us all better  faster  and stronger. Living by numbers.  And this one  which is really telling  this was from July  this cover article   The personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet of life  from sleep to mood to pain          .  Well  I tried this device. A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life. I didn't have one of those  but I got the Fitbit. That looks like this. It's like a wireless accelerometer  pedometer. And I want to just give you the results of that testing  because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement. I hope the  by the way  the Phillips Direct Life works better    I hope so. But this monitors food  it monitors activity and tracks weight. However you have to put in most of this stuff. The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity  and even then  it's not complete. So  you exercise and it picks up the exercise. You put in your height and weight  it calculates BMI  and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending from the exercise  and how many you took in  if you go in and enter all the foods. But it really wants you to enter all your activity. And so I went to this  and of course I was gratified that it picked up the    minutes of exercise  elliptical exercise I did  but then it wants more information. So  it says   You want to log sexual activity. How long did you do it for   And it says   How hard was it   Furthermore it says   Start time.  Now  this doesn't appear    this just doesn't work  I mean  this just doesn't work. So  now I want to move to sleep. Who would ever have thought you could have your own EEG at your home  tagged to a very nice alarm clock  by the way  This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock. It monitors your brainwaves continuously  when you're sleeping. So  I did this thing for seven days getting ready for TEDMed. This is an important part of our life  one third you're supposed to be sleeping. Of course how many here have any problems with sleeping  It's usually    percent. So  you tell me you sleep better than expected. Okay  well this was a week of my life in sleeping  and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score  you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up. You say   Oh  OK.  And a Z.Q. score is adjusted to age  and you want to get as high as you possibly can. So this is the moment by moment  or minute by minute sleep. And you see that Z.Q. there was    odd. And the wake time is in orange. And this can be a problem  as I learned. Because it not only helps you with quantifying your sleep  but also tells others you're awake. So  when my wife came in and she could tell you're awake.  Eric  I want to talk. I want to talk.  And I'm trying to play possum. This thing is very  very impressive. OK. So  that's the first night. And this one is now     and that's not a good score. And this tells you  of course  how much you had in REM sleep  in deep sleep  and all this sort of thing. This was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep. So  it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group. It's like a managed competition of sleep. And really interesting stuff. Look at this thing and say   Well  I didn't think I was a very good sleeper  but actually I did better than average in    to    year olds.  OK  And the key thing was  what I didn't know  was that I was a really good dreamer. OK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases. Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease  or    percent of age greater than    have two or more chronic disease      million Americans have one or more chronic disease  and    percent of our  .   whatever  trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease. Now  diabetes is one of the big ones. Almost    million people have diabetes. And here is the latest map. It was published just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times  and it isn't looking good. That is  for men     percent in the country over    have Type II diabetes  and women  although it's less  it's terribly high. But of course we have a way to measure that now on a continuous basis  with a sensor that detects blood glucose  and it's important because we could detect hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known  and also hypoglycemia. And you can see the red dots  in this particular patient's case  were finger sticks  which would have missed both ends. But by continuous monitoring  it captures all that vital information. The future of this though  is being able to move this to a Band Aid type phenomenon  and that's not so far away. So  let me just give you  very quickly     top targets for wireless medicine. All these things are possible    some of them are very close  or already  as you heard  are available today  in some way or form. Alzheimer's disease  there's five million people affected  and you can check vital signs  activity  balance. Asthma  large number  we could detect things like pollen count  air quality  respiratory rate. Breast cancer  I'll show you an example of that real quickly. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Depression  there's a great approach to that in mood disorders. Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension     million people could have continuous blood pressure monitoring to come up with much better management and prevention. And obesity we already talked about  the ways to get to that. And sleep disorders. This is effective around the world. The access to smartphones and cell phones today is extraordinary. And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world   Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people  more quickly  than any previous technology.  And that's before we got going on the m health world. Aging  The problem is enormous          broken hips per year  but the solutions are extraordinary  and they include so many different things. One of the ones I just wanted to mention  The iShoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling. One of many different techniques using wireless sensors. So  we can change medicine across the continuum of care  across the ages from premies or unborn children to seniors  the pharmaceutical arena changes  the full spectrum of disease    I hope I've given you a sense of that    across the globe. There are two things that can really accelerate this whole process. One of them    we're very fortunate    is to develop a dedicated institute and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ... and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West  to get behind this wireless health institute. San Diego is an extraordinary place for this. There's over     wireless companies      of which or more are working in wireless health. It's the number one source of commerce  and interestingly it dovetails beautifully with over     life science companies. The wireless institute  the West Wireless Health Institute  is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening  Gary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this. Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible  and this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open. It looks like this  this whole building dedicated. And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era  to take unmet medical needs  to work and innovate    and we just appointed the chief engineer  Mehran Mehregany  it was announced on Monday    then to move up with development  clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice  the most challenging thing of all  requiring attention to reimbursement  healthcare policy  healthcare economics. The other big thing  besides having this fantastic institute to catalyze this process is guidance  and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital. If we understand biology from genomics and omics and wireless through physiologic phenotyping  that's big. Because what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before. Over    major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level  but this is quite extraordinary  More has been learned about the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man. And when you put that together with  for example  now an app for the iPhone with your genotype to guide drug therapy ... but  the future    we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes from all the common variants  and that's going to get filled in more with low frequency variants in the future. We can tell who's going to get breast cancer from the various genes. We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation. And finally  another example  sudden cardiac death. Each of these has a sensor. We can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it. We can prevent  or have the earliest detection possible  for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient. An iPatch  iRhythm  for atrial fibrillation. And vital signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death. We lose         people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death. So  I hope I've convinced you of this  of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more. It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it's hyper innovative  and I think it represents the black swan of medicine. Thanks for your attention. I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is. Autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe    the child remains non verbal    all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers. And I actually feel at home here  because there's a lot of autism genetics here. You wouldn't have any... It's a continuum of traits. When does a nerd turn into Asperger  which is just mild autism  I mean  Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today. And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things  you know  that Bill Gates talked about this morning. OK. Now  if you want to understand autism  animals. And I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking. You have to get away from verbal language. I think in pictures  I don't think in language. Now  the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details. OK  this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters  or pick out the little letters  and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly. And the thing is  the normal brain ignores the details. Well  if you're building a bridge  details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details. And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract. People are getting away from doing hands on stuff. I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands on classes  because art  and classes like that  those are the classes where I excelled. In my work with cattle  I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle balk. Like  for example  this flag waving  right in front of the veterinary facility. This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility  all they needed to do was move the flag. Rapid movement  contrast. In the early '  s when I started  I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing. People thought that was crazy. A coat on a fence would make them balk  shadows would make them balk  a hose on the floor ... people weren't noticing these things    a chain hanging down    and that's shown very  very nicely in the movie. In fact  I loved the movie  how they duplicated all my projects. That's the geek side. My drawings got to star in the movie too. And actually it's called  Temple Grandin   not  Thinking In Pictures.  So  what is thinking in pictures  It's literally movies in your head. My mind works like Google for images. Now  when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different. I thought everybody thought in pictures. And then when I did my book   Thinking In Pictures   I start interviewing people about how they think. And I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different. Like if I say   Think about a church steeple  most people get this sort of generalized generic one. Now  maybe that's not true in this room  but it's going to be true in a lot of different places. I see only specific pictures. They flash up into my memory  just like Google for pictures. And in the movie  they've got a great scene in there where the word  shoe  is said  and a whole bunch of '  s and '  s shoes pop into my imagination. OK  there is my childhood church  that's specific. There's some more  Fort Collins. OK  how about famous ones  And they just kind of come up  kind of like this. Just really quickly  like Google for pictures. And they come up one at a time  and then I think   OK  well maybe we can have it snow  or we can have a thunderstorm   and I can hold it there and turn them into videos. Now  visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle handling facilities. And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant. I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides. I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it. But  one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind  just like a virtual reality computer system. And this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie. That was like just so super cool. And there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set too. But one of the things that really worries me is  Where's the younger version of those kids going today  They're not ending up in Silicon Valley  where they belong. Now  one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social  is I had to sell my work  and not myself. And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings  I showed off pictures of things. Another thing that helped me as a little kid is  boy  in the '  s  you were taught manners. You were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around. Now  when kids get to be in third or fourth grade  you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker  drawing in perspective. Now  I want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker. Now  I had this brain scan done several years ago  and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex. This is tensor imaging. And my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's. The red lines there are me  and the blue lines are the sex and age matched control. And there I got a gigantic one  and the control over there  the blue one  has got a really small one. And some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex. Now  the thing is  the visual thinker's just one kind of mind. You see  the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind    good at one thing  bad at something else. And where I was bad was algebra. And I was never allowed to take geometry or trig. Gigantic mistake  I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra  go right to geometry and trig. Now  another kind of mind is the pattern thinker. More abstract. These are your engineers  your computer programmers. Now  this is pattern thinking. That praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper    no scotch tape  no cuts. And there in the background is the pattern for folding it. Here are the types of thinking  photo realistic visual thinkers  like me  pattern thinkers  music and math minds. Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading. You also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic. You'll see these different kinds of minds. And then there's a verbal mind  they know every fact about everything. Now  another thing is the sensory issues. I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face. And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it  and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin. But sensory is an issue. Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights  others have problems with sound sensitivity. You know  it's going to be variable. Now  visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind. Because think about it  An animal is a sensory based thinker  not verbal    thinks in pictures  thinks in sounds  thinks in smells. Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant. He knows who's been there  when they were there. Are they friend or foe  Is there anybody he can go mate with  There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant. It's all very detailed information  and  looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals. Now  the animal mind  and also my mind  puts sensory based information into categories. Man on a horse and a man on the ground    that is viewed as two totally different things. You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider. They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer  but you can't ride him. You have another horse  where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground  with the veterinarian  but a person can ride him. Cattle are the same way. Man on a horse  a man on foot    they're two different things. You see  it's a different picture. See  I want you to think about just how specific this is. Now  this ability to put information into categories  I find a lot of people are not very good at this. When I'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant  they don't seem to be able to figure out   Do I have a training people issue  Or do I have something wrong with the equipment   In other words  categorize equipment problem from a people problem. I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that. Now  let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem. Is it a minor problem  with something simple I can fix  Or is the whole design of the system wrong  People have a hard time figuring that out. Let's just look at something like  you know  solving problems with making airlines safer. Yeah  I'm a million mile flier. I do lots and lots of flying  and if I was at the FAA  what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of  It would be their airplane tails. You know  five fatal wrecks in the last    years  the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way. It's tails  pure and simple. And when the pilots walk around the plane  guess what  They can't see that stuff inside the tail. You know  now as I think about that  I'm pulling up all of that specific information. It's specific. See  my thinking's bottom up. I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle. Now  here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats. He'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat. White cowboy hats  that was absolutely fine. Now  the thing is  the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together. We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds. And one of the things that is driving me really crazy  as I travel around and I do autism meetings  is I'm seeing a lot of smart  geeky  nerdy kids  and they just aren't very social  and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science. And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher. My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie. I was a goofball student. When I was in high school I just didn't care at all about studying  until I had Mr. Carlock's science class. He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie. And he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room. This brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids interesting stuff. You know  one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED  and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on. Because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids  and the teachers out in the Midwest  and the other parts of the country  when you get away from these tech areas  they don't know what to do with these kids. And they're not going down the right path. The thing is  you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind  or your mind can be wired to be more social. And what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back here  in the really brilliant mind  and we lose a few social circuits here. It's kind of a trade off between thinking and social. And then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be non verbal. In the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals. This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller. And he studied Alzheimer's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia. And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain  and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars. Now  Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics  but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence  which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head. And the Wolfram stuff    I was taking notes and I was writing down all the search words I could use  because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures. We've got to show these kids interesting stuff. And they've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class. I mean art was my best subject in school. We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds  and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds  because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future. And let's talk about jobs. OK  my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball that didn't want to study. But you know what  I was getting work experience. I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things  like how to be on time. I was taught that when I was eight years old. You know  how to have table manners at granny's Sunday party. I was taught that when I was very  very young. And when I was     I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes. I did internships in college  I was building things  and I also had to learn how to do assignments. You know  all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little. My mother said   Well let's do a picture of something else.  They've got to learn how to do something else. Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos. Let's get him working on building different things. The thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated. Like if a kid loves racecars  let's use racecars for math. Let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance. In other words  use that fixation in order to motivate that kid  that's one of the things we need to do. I really get fed up when they  you know  the teachers  especially when you get away from this part of the country  they don't know what to do with these smart kids. It just drives me crazy. What can visual thinkers do when they grow up  They can do graphic design  all kinds of stuff with computers  photography  industrial design. The pattern thinkers  they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians  your software engineers  your computer programmers  all of those kinds of jobs. And then you've got the word minds. They make great journalists  and they also make really  really good stage actors. Because the thing about being autistic is  I had to learn social skills like being in a play. It's just kind of    you just have to learn it. And we need to be working with these students. And this brings up mentors. You know  my science teacher was not an accredited teacher. He was a NASA space scientist. Now  some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology  or a degree in chemistry  you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry. We need to be doing that. Because what I'm observing is the good teachers  for a lot of these kids  are out in the community colleges  but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools. Another thing that can be very  very  very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry  and they can teach your kid. And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old  because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark. You're getting that kid turned on. And you get him turned on  then he'll learn all the new stuff. Mentors are just essential. I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me. And we've got to mentor them  hire them. And if you bring them in for internships in your companies  the thing about the autism  Asperger y kind of mind  you've got to give them a specific task. Don't just say   Design new software.  You've got to tell them something a lot more specific   Well  we're designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing. And it can only use so much memory.  That's the kind of specificity you need. Well  that's the end of my talk. And I just want to thank everybody for coming. It was great to be here. Oh  you've got a question for me  OK. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much for that. You know  you once wrote  I like this quote   If by some magic  autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth  then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave.  Temple Grandin  Because who do you think made the first stone spears  The Asperger guy. And if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics there would be no more Silicon Valley  and the energy crisis would not be solved. CA  So  I want to ask you a couple other questions  and if any of these feel inappropriate  it's okay just to say   Next question.  But if there is someone here who has an autistic child  or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them  what advice would you give them  TG  Well  first of all  you've got to look at age. If you have a two  three or four year old you know  no speech  no social interaction  I can't emphasize enough  Don't wait  you need at least    hours a week of one to one teaching. You know  the thing is  autism comes in different degrees. There's going to be about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn to talk  and they're not going to be working Silicon Valley  that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do. But then you get the smart  geeky kids that have a touch of autism  and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things. I got social interaction through shared interest. I rode horses with other kids  I made model rockets with other kids  did electronics lab with other kids  and in the '  s  it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show. That was like  we considered that super cool. CA  Is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them  as some might  as most  wish  TG  Well let me tell you  that child will be loyal  and if your house is burning down  they're going to get you out of it. CA  Wow. So  most people  if you ask them what are they most passionate about  they'd say things like   My kids  or  My lover.  What are you most passionate about  TG  I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place. When I have a mother of an autistic child say   My kid went to college because of your book  or one of your lectures   that makes me happy. You know  the slaughter plants  I've worked with them in the '  s  they were absolutely awful. I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes  How many cattle fell down  How many cattle got poked with the prodder  How many cattle are mooing their heads off  And it's very  very simple. You directly observe a few simple things. It's worked really well. I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world. We need a lot more of that  and a lot less abstract stuff. CA  When we were talking on the phone  one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms. Tell me about that. TG  Well the reason why I got really excited when I read about that  it contains knowledge. It's libraries. And to me  knowledge is something that is extremely valuable. So  maybe  over    years ago now our library got flooded. And this is before the Internet got really big. And I was really upset about all the books being wrecked  because it was knowledge being destroyed. And server farms  or data centers are great libraries of knowledge. CA  Temple  can I just say it's an absolute delight to have you at TED. TG  Well thank you so much. Thank you. If you are a blind child in India  you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news. The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none  and that's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults  and there are very  very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children. In fact  if you were to be treated  you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates. This is a three year old orphan girl who had cataracts. So  her caretakers took her to the village medicine man  and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital  the person decided to burn her abdomen with red hot iron bars to drive out the demons. The second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists  who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age  that even if you have your eye corrected  the chances of your brain learning how to see are very  very slim    again  slim or none. So when I heard these two things  it troubled me deeply  both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons. So let me first start with the personal reason. It'll sound corny  but it's sincere. That's my son  Darius. As a new father  I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are  what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child. I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius  and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment  that's just viscerally wrong. So that's the personal reason. Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods    that if the brain is older than four or five years of age  it loses its ability to learn    that doesn't sit well with me  because I don't think that idea has been tested adequately. The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work  two researchers who were at Harvard  and they got the Nobel Prize in      for their studies of visual physiology  which are remarkably beautiful studies  but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely. So  they did their work with kittens  with different kinds of deprivation regiments  and those studies  which date back to the '  s  are now being applied to human children. So I felt that I needed to do two things. One  provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment. That's the humanitarian mission. And the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity. And these two missions  as you can tell  thread together perfectly. One adds to the other  in fact  one would be impossible without the other. So  to implement these twin missions  a few years ago  I launched Project Prakash. Prakash  as many of you know  is the Sanskrit word for light  and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children  we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience. And the logo    even though it looks extremely Irish  it's actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya  an earthen lamp. The Prakash  the overall effort has three components  outreach  to identify children in need of care  medical treatment  and in subsequent study. And I want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work. This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind. Pawan Sinha  So  because this is a school for the blind  many children have permanent conditions. That's a case of microphthalmos  which is malformed eyes  and that's a permanent condition  it cannot be treated. That's an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos. But  every so often  we come across children who show some residual vision  and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable. So  after that screening  we bring the children to the hospital. That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi  the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital. It has a very well equipped pediatric ophthalmic center  which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity. So  eating burgers actually helps. eye health in many children  and ... ... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.  PS  So  as I zoom in to the eyes of this child  you will see the cause of his blindness. The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts  so opacities of the lens. In our eyes  the lens is clear  but in this child  the lens has become opaque  and therefore he can't see the world. So  the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye. Here's the eye with the opaque lens  the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted. And here's the same child three weeks post operation  with the right eye open. Thank you. So  even from that little clip  you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible  and we have now provided treatment to over     children  and the story repeats itself. After treatment  the child gains significant functionality. In fact  the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation. We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right  SRD  and she got her sight late in life  and her vision is remarkable at this age. I should add a tragic postscript to this    she died two years ago in a bus accident. So  hers is just a truly inspiring story    unknown  but inspiring story. So when we started finding these results  as you might imagine  it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press. Here's an article in Nature that profiled this work  and another one in Time. So  we were fairly convinced    we are convinced    that recovery is feasible  despite extended visual deprivation. The next obvious question to ask  What is the process of recovery  So  the way we study that is  let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity. The child is provided treatment  and I want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional  there is no quid pro quo. We treat many more children then we actually work with. Every child who needs treatment is treated. After treatment  about every week  we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line. And we try to do this for as long as possible. This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up. What might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones  And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies  but I want to highlight one particular one  and that is image parsing into objects. So  any image of the kind that you see on the left  be it a real image or a synthetic image  it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column  regions of different colors  different luminances. The brain has this complex task of putting together  integrating  subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful  into what we would consider to be objects  as you see on the right. And nobody knows how this integration happens  and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash. So  here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight. Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago  and you see Ethan Myers  a graduate student from MIT  running the experiment with him. His visual motor coordination is quite poor  but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out. If you show him real world images  if you show others like him real world images  they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over fragmented  it's made up of a collage  a patchwork  of regions of different colors and luminances. And that's what's indicated in the green outlines. When you ask them   Even if you can't name the objects  just point to where the objects are   these are the regions that they point to. So the world is this complex patchwork of regions. Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object. Interestingly enough  you give them a few months  and this is what happens. Doctor  How many are these  Patient  These are two things. Doctor  What are their shapes  Patient  Their shapes ... This one is a circle  and this is a square. PS  A very dramatic transformation has come about. And the question is  What underlies this transformation  It's a profound question  and what's even more amazing is how simple the answer is. The answer lies in motion and that's what I want to show you in the next clip. Doctor  What shape do you see here  Patient  I can't make it out. Doctor  Now  Patient  Triangle. Doctor  How many things are these  Now  how many things are these  Patient  Two. Doctor  What are these things  Patient  A square and a circle. PS  And we see this pattern over and over again. The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information. So the inference we are deriving from this  and several such experiments  is that dynamic information processing  or motion processing  serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing  it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition. This simple idea has far reaching implications. And let me just quickly mention two  one  drawing from the domain of engineering  and one from the clinic. So  from the perspective of engineering  we can ask  Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system  can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine based vision systems that can learn on their own  that don't need to be programmed by a human programmer  And that's what we're trying to do. I'm at MIT  at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain. So we are creating Dylan  which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive  and autonomously discovering  What are the objects in this visual input  So  don't worry about the internals of Dylan. Here  I'm just going to talk about how we test Dylan. The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs  as I said  of the same kind that a baby  or a child in Project Prakash would get. But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out  Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs  So  I thought  could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier  and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan  So that's what we did. I had to have long conversations with my wife. In fact  Pam  if you're watching this  please forgive me. So  we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity. As some of you might know  babyies are born pretty much legally blind. Their acuity    our acuity is        babies' acuity is like         so they are looking at the world in a very  very blurry fashion. Here's what a baby cam video looks like. Thankfully  there isn't any audio to go with this. What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input  the baby  very quickly  is able to discover meaning in such input. But then two or three days afterward  babies begin to pay attention to their mother's or their father's face. How does that happen  We want Dylan to be able to do that  and using this mantra of motion  Dylan actually can do that. So  given that kind of video input  with just about six or seven minutes worth of video  Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces. So  it's an important demonstration of the power of motion. The clinical implication  it comes from the domain of autism. Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers. When we saw that  we asked  Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath  of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism  Because  if that hypothesis were to be true  it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype. What you're going to see are video clips of two children    one neurotypical  one with autism  playing Pong. So  while the child is playing Pong  we are tracking where they're looking. In red are the eye movement traces. This is the neurotypical child  and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go. Even before the ball gets to a place  the child is already looking there. Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game. Instead of anticipating  the child always follows where the ball has been. The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism. So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon. Looking ahead  if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we've treated so far  this is the magnitude of the problem. The red dots are the children we have not treated. So  there are many  many more children who need to be treated  and in order to expand the scope of the project  we are planning on launching The Prakash Center for Children  which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital  a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting edge research facility. The Prakash Center will integrate health care  education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts. So  to summarize  Prakash  in its five years of existence  it's had an impact in multiple areas  ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain  to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism  the development of autonomous machine vision systems  education of the undergraduate and graduate students  and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness. And for my students and I  it's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research  while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with. Thank you very much. I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo. I was sent straight away to my school principal  and my school principal  a sweet nun  looked at my book with disgust  flipped through the pages  saw all the nudes    you know  I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her    and the nun slapped me on my face and said   Sweet Jesus  this kid has already begun.  I had no clue what she was talking about  but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again until the ninth grade. Thanks to a really boring lecture  I started caricaturing my teachers in school. And  you know  I got a lot of popularity. I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports. I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home. I'm not on top of the class. So for me  cartooning gave me a sense of identity. I got popular  but I was scared I'd get caught again. So what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I had drawn  glorified my school principal  put him right on top  and gifted it to him. He had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board. This is a part of that. And I became a school hero. All my seniors knew me. I felt really special. I have to tell you a little bit about my family. That's my mother. I love her to bits. She's the one who taught me how to draw and  more importantly  how to love. She's a bit of a hippie. She said   Don't say that   but I'm saying it anyway. The rest of my family are boring academics  busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car. My father's a little different. My father believed in a holistic approach to living  and  you know  every time he taught us  he'd say   I hate these books  because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution.  While he still held that worldview  I was     I got the best lawyer in town  my older brother Karthik  and I sat him down  and I said   Pa  from today onwards I've decided I'm going to be disciplined  I'm going to be curious  I'm going to learn something new every day  I'm going to be very hard working  and I'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially.  And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me. And I said   Hold that thought.  I said   Can I quit school then   But  to cut a long story short  I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist. I must have done about        caricatures. I would do birthday parties  weddings  divorces  anything for anyone who wanted to use my services. But  most importantly  while I was traveling  I taught children cartooning  and in exchange  I learned how to be spontaneous. And mad and crazy and fun. When I started teaching them  I said let me start doing this professionally. When I was    I started my own school. However  an    year old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter. So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my home town  Bangalore. And  you know  just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here  and if you had to meet Bush  it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight. I had to meet my Prime Minister. I went to the place where his helicopter was about to land. I saw layers of security. I caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards  but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third. And what happened was  to my luck  I saw a nuclear scientist at whose party I had done cartoons. I ran up to him  and said   Hello  sir. How do you do   He said   What are you doing here  Raghava   I said   I'm here to meet the Prime Minister.  He said   Oh  so am I.  I hopped into his car  and off we went through the remaining layers of security. Thank you. I sat him down  I caricatured him  and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities. This is one I remember fondly. Salman Rushdie was pissed off I think because I altered the map of New York  if you notice. Anyway  the next slide I'm about to show you    Should I just turn that off  The next slide I'm about to show you  is a little more serious. I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after     . What was  for me  a very naive observation  turned out to be a disaster. That evening  I came home to hundreds of hate mails  hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this. I was also asked to leave the organization  a cartoonists' organization in America  that for me was my lifeline. That's when I realized  you know  cartoons are really powerful  art comes with responsibility. Anyway  what I did was I decided that I need to take a break. I quit my job at the papers  I closed my school  and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks  and I decided to go traveling. When I went traveling  I remember  I met this fabulous old man  who I met when I was caricaturing  who turned out to be an artist  in Italy. He invited me to his studio. He said   Come and visit.  When I went  I saw the ghastliest thing ever. I saw this dead  naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling. I said   Oh  my God. What is that   And I asked him  and he said   Oh  that thing  In the night  I die. In the morning  I am born again.  I thought he was koo koo  but something about that really stuck. I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that. So I said   I am dead  so I need to be born again.  So  I wanted to be a painter like him  except  I don't know how to paint. So  I tried going to the art store. You know  there are a hundred types of brushes. Forget it  they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. So I decided  I'm going to learn to paint by myself. I'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how I painted and a little bit about my city  Bangalore. They had to be larger than life. Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger. And even bigger. And for me it was  I had to dance while I painted. It was so exciting. Except  I even started painting dancers. Here for example is a Flamenco dancer  except there was one problem. I didn't know the dance form  so I started following them  and I made some money  sold my paintings and would rush off to France or Spain and work with them. That's Pepe Linares  the renowned Flamenco singer. But I had one problem  my paintings never danced. As much energy as I put into them while making them  they never danced. So I decided    I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning. I called my friends  painted on their bodies  and had them dance in front of a painting. And  all of a sudden  my paintings came alive. And then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus. And I sat like you guys there in the audience. And I saw my work come alive. You know  normally you work in isolation  and you show at a gallery  but here  the work was coming alive  and it had some other artists working with me. The collaborative effort was fabulous. I said  I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet. I started doing fashion. This is a fashion show we held in London. The best collaboration  of course  is with children. They are ruthless  they are honest  but they're full of energy and fun. This is a work  a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation. And I must say  I spent time in the Bronx working with these kids. And  in exchange for me working with them  they taught me how to be cool. I don't think I've succeeded  but they've taught me. They said   Stop saying sorry. Say  my bad.  Then I said  all this is good  but I want to paint like a real painter. American education is so expensive. I was in India  and I was walking down the streets  and I saw a billboard painter. And these guys paint humongous paintings  and they look really good. And I wondered how they did it from so close. So  one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys  and I said   How do you paint like that  Who taught you   And he said   Oh  it's very easy. I can teach you  but we're leaving the city  because billboard painters are a dying  extinct bunch of artists  because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them.  I said  in exchange for education in how to paint  I will support them  and I started a company. And since then  I've been painting all over the place. This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment. This is another painting. And  in fact  I started painting on anything  and started sending them around town. Since I mentioned my wife  the most important collaboration has been with her  Netra. Netra and I met when she was   . I must have been    and a half then  and it was love at first sight. I lived in India. She lived in America. She'd come every two months to visit me  and then I said I'm the man  I'm the man  and I have to reciprocate. I have to travel seven oceans  and I have to come and see you. I did that twice  and I went broke. So then I said   Nets  what do I do   She said   Why don't you send me your paintings  My dad knows a bunch of rich guys. We'll try and con them into buying it  and then...  But it turned out  after I sent the works to her  that her dad's friends  like most of you  are geeks. I'm joking. No  they were really big geeks  and they didn't know much about art. So Netra was stuck with    paintings of mine. So what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it. She contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work. She made enough money  she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers  a company  everything  and she became my manager. That's us in New York. Notice one thing  we're equal here. Something happened along the line. But this brought me    with Netra managing my career    it brought me a lot of success. I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar. I loved the attention. This is all the press we got  and we said  it's time to celebrate. And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra. I said   Let's get married.  And I said   Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us  all the people who bought our work.  And you won't believe it  we put together a list of       people  who had made a difference    a ridiculous list  but I was determined to bring them to India  so    a lot of them were in India.     artists volunteered to help me with my wedding. We had fashion designers  installation artists  models  we had makeup artists  jewelry designers  all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation. And I had a special installation in tribute to my in laws. I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me. But all this excitement led to the press writing about us. We were in the papers  we're still in the news three years later  but  unfortunately  something tragic happened right after. My mother fell very ill. I love my mother and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die. And they said you have to say bye to her  you have to do what you have to do. And I was devastated. I had shows booked up for another year. I was on a high. And I couldn't. I could not. My life was not exuberant. I could not live this larger than life person. I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind. Of course  my work turned ugly  but another thing happened. I lost all my audiences. The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared. The collectors  the friends  the press  everyone said   Nice  but thank you.   No thank you   was more like it. But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut  because I was painting it from my gut. If they wanted beauty  I said  this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized. Of course  none of them liked it. My works also turned autobiographical. At this point  something else happened. A very  very dear friend of mine came out of the closet  and in India at that time  it was illegal to be gay  and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person. I was very upset. I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl    that's me there    because she wanted a girl  and she has only boys. Anyway  I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk. It's a secret. So  after this  my works turned a little violent. I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform. And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality. This time  not only did my collectors disappear  the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing. It turned nasty  and I'm a bit of a chicken. I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat. So  I decided it was time to end and go back home. This time I said let's try something different. I need to be reborn again. And I thought the best way  as most of you know who have children  the best way to have a new lease on life  is to have a child. I decided to have a child  and before I did that  I quickly studied what can go wrong. How can a family get dysfunctional  And Rudra was born. That's my little son. And two magical things happened after he was born. My mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation  and this man was elected president of this country. You know I sat at home and I watched. I teared up and I said that's where I want to be. So Netra and I wound up our life  closed up everything we had  and we decided to move to New York. And this was just eight months ago. I moved back to New York  my work has changed. Everything about my work has become more whimsical. This one is called  What the Fuck Was I Thinking   It talks about mental incest. You know  I may appear to be a very nice  clean  sweet boy. But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything. But I'm very civil in my action  I assure you. These are just different cartoons. And  before I go  I want to tell you a little story. I was talking to mother and father this morning  and my dad said   I know you have so much you want to say  but you have to talk about your work with children.  So I said  okay. I work with children all over the world  and that's an entirely different talk  but I want to leave you with one story that really  really inspired me. I met Belinda when she was   . I was   . I was in Australia  and Belinda had cancer  and I was told she's not going to live very long. They  in fact  told me three weeks. I walk into her room  and there was a shy girl  and she was bald  and she was trying to hide her baldness. I whipped out my pen  and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her. And then  we started talking  and we spent a lovely time    I told her how I ended up in Australia  how I backpacked and who I conned  and how I got a ticket  and all the stories. And I drew it out for her. And then I left. Belinda died and within a few days of her death  they published a book for her  and she used my cartoon on the cover. And she wrote a little note  she said   Hey Rags  thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world.  For me  my art is my magic carpet ride. I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride  and touch children and be honest. Thank you so much.
