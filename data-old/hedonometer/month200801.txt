Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart. I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion. There's a Jewish saying that I love. What is truer than truth  Answer  The story. I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity. All stories interest me  and some haunt me until I end up writing them. Certain themes keep coming up  justice  loyalty  violence  death  political and social issues  freedom. I'm aware of the mystery around us  so I write about coincidences  premonitions  emotions  dreams  the power of nature  magic. In the last    years I have published a few books  but I have lived in anonymity until February of       when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy. That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's  and my grandchildren think that I'm cool. Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame. One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony  of the opening ceremony  called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag bearers. I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete. Actually  I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker. I was told that this was no laughing matter. This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag. Five women  representing five continents  and three Olympic gold medal winners. My first question was  naturally  what was I going to wear  A uniform  she said  and asked for my measurements. My measurements. I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak  looking like the Michelin Man. By the middle of February  I found myself in Turin  where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the    Olympic teams was in the street. Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games. They all deserved to win  but there's the element of luck. A speck of snow  an inch of ice  the force of the wind  can determine the result of a race or a game. However  what matters most    more than training or luck    is the heart. Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal. It is all about passion. The streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics. Passion lives here. Isn't it always true  Heart is what drives us and determines our fate. That is what I need for my characters in my books  a passionate heart. I need mavericks  dissidents  adventurers  outsiders and rebels  who ask questions  bend the rules and take risks. People like all of you in this room. Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters. They only make good former spouses. In the green room of the stadium  I met the other flag bearers  three athletes  and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren. Also  two women with passionate hearts  Wangari Maathai  the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya who has planted    million trees. And by doing so  she has changed the soil  the weather  in some places in Africa  and of course the economic conditions in many villages. And Somaly Mam  a Cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution. When she was    years old  her grandfather sold her to a brothel. She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS. And of brothels where children are forced to receive five     clients per day  and if they rebel  they are tortured with electricity. In the green room I received my uniform. It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear  but it was far from the Michelin Man suit that I had anticipated. Not bad  really. I looked like a refrigerator. But so did most of the flag bearers  except Sophia Loren  the universal symbol of beauty and passion. Sophia is over    and she looks great. She's sexy  slim and tall  with a deep tan. Now  how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles  I don't know. When asked in a TV interview   How could she look so good   She replied   Posture. My back is always straight  and I don't make old people's noises.  So  there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth. No grunting  no coughing  no wheezing  no talking to yourselves  no farting. Well  she didn't say that exactly. At some point around midnight  we were summoned to the wings of the stadium  and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag  and the music started    by the way  the same music that starts here  the Aida March. Sophia Loren was right in front of me    she's a foot taller than I am  not counting the poofy hair. She walked elegantly  like a giraffe on the African savannah  holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind    on my tiptoes    holding the flag on my extended arm  so that my head was actually under the damn flag. All the cameras were  of course  on Sophia. That was fortunate for me  because in most press photos I appear too  although often between Sophia's legs. A place where most men would love to be. The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium. My husband is offended when I say this    although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes       so he shouldn't take it personally. I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes  because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells. I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics    passion. So here's a tale of passion. The year is       the place is a prison camp for Tutsi refugees in Congo. By the way     percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls. We can call this place in Congo a death camp  because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation. The protagonists of this story are a young woman  Rose Mapendo  and her children. She's pregnant and a widow. Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed. Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive  and a few months later  she gives birth to premature twins. Two tiny little boys. She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick  and ties it with her own hair. She names the twins after the camp's commanders to gain their favor  and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them. When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter  she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go  even when they hold a gun to her head. Somehow  the family survives for    months  and then  by extraordinary luck  and the passionate heart of a young American man  Sasha Chanoff  who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane  Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix  Arizona  where they're now living and thriving. Mapendo  in Swahili  means great love. The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Mapendo. I don't make them up. There's no need for that. I look around and I see them everywhere. I have worked with women and for women all my life. I know them well. I was born in ancient times  at the end of the world  in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family. No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist    although the term had not reached Chile yet  so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me. I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom  and for questioning the patriarchy. But I was happy to pay it  because for every blow that I received  I was able to deliver two. Once  when my daughter Paula was in her twenties  she said to me that feminism was dated  that I should move on. We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated  Yes  for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today  but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage  prostitution  forced labor    they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed. They have no control over their bodies or their lives. They have no education and no freedom. They are raped  beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity. For most Western young women of today  being called a feminist is an insult. Feminism has never been sexy  but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting  and I have seldom suffered from lack of men. Feminism is not dead  by no means. It has evolved. If you don't like the term  change it  for Goddess' sake. Call it Aphrodite  or Venus  or bimbo  or whatever you want  the name doesn't matter  as long as we understand what it is about  and we support it. So here's another tale of passion  and this is a sad one. The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh. The year is     . Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three week vacation. She's prepared to clean teeth  but when she gets there  she finds out that there are no doctors  no dentists  and the clinic is just a hut full of flies. Outside  there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated. The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars. Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth. She's not licensed for that  she has never done it. She risks a lot and she's terrified. She doesn't even have the proper instruments  but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine. Jenny has a brave and passionate heart. She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation. At the end  the relieved patient kisses her hands. That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth. The next morning  when she comes again to the so called clinic  her first patient is waiting for her with her husband. The woman's face looks like a watermelon. It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes. The husband  furious  threatens to kill the American. Jenny is horrified at what she has done  but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation. The day before  her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him. Millions of women live like this today. They are the poorest of the poor. Although women do two thirds of the world's labor  they own less than one percent of the world's assets. They are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all  and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence  and they are constantly threatened by exploitation  violence and abuse. It is a fact that giving women education  work  the ability to control their own income  inherit and own property  benefits the society. If a woman is empowered  her children and her family will be better off. If families prosper  the village prospers  and eventually so does the whole country. Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya. She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees. She gets the women to plant new trees and water them  drop by drop. In a matter of five or six years  they have a forest  the soil is enriched  and the village is saved. The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down. Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy. For every dollar given to a women's program     dollars are given to men's programs. Women are    percent of humankind. Empowering them will change everything    more than technology and design and entertainment. I can promise you that women working together    linked  informed and educated    can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet. In any war today  most of the casualties are civilians  mainly women and children. They are collateral damage. Men run the world  and look at the mess we have. What kind of world do we want  This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking. Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order  We want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody  not only for the privileged. In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings at the UC Berkeley library. No museum or gallery in the United States  except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work  has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the Abu Ghraib prison. They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power  in the voluminous Botero style. I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart. What I fear most is power with impunity. I fear abuse of power  and the power to abuse. In our species  the alpha males define reality  and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules. The rules change all the time  but they always benefit them  and in this case  the trickle down effect  which does not work in economics  works perfectly. Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom. Women and children  especially the poor  are at the bottom. Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse    a woman or a child. I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender  income  race  and class. I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization. But for real change  we need feminine energy in the management of the world. We need a critical number of women in positions of power  and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men. I'm talking about men with young minds  of course. Old guys are hopeless  we have to wait for them to die off. Yes  I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs and legendary breasts. But given a choice  I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai  Somaly Mam  Jenny and Rose Mapendo. I want to make this world good. Not better  but to make it good. Why not  It is possible. Look around in this room    all this knowledge  energy  talent and technology. Let's get off our fannies  roll up our sleeves and get to work  passionately  in creating an almost perfect world. Thank you. We are going to talk today about the sequel of  Inconvenient Truth.  It's time again to talk about  Inconvenient Truth   a truth that everyone is concerned about  but nobody is willing to talk about. Somebody has to take the lead  and I decided to do it. If you are scared by global warming  wait until we learn about local warming. We will talk today about local warming. Important health message  blogging may be hazardous to your health  especially if you are a male. This message is given as a public service. Blogging affects your posture. We start with the posture. This is the posture of ladies who are not blogging  this is the posture of ladies who are blogging. This is the natural posture of a man sitting  squatting for ventilation purposes. And this is the natural posture of a standing man  and I think this picture inspired Chris to insert me into the lateral thinking session. This is male blogging posture sitting  and the result is   For greater comfort  men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women  when working on laptop. However  they will adopt a less natural posture in order to balance it on their laps  which resulted in a significant rise of body heat between their thighs.  This is the issue of local warming. This is a very serious newspaper  it's Times of England    very serious. This is a very       gentlemen and ladies  be serious. This is a very serious research  that you should read the underline. And be careful  your genes are in danger. Will geeks become endangered species  The fact  population growth in countries with high laptop    I need Hans Rosling to give me a graph. Global warming fun. But let's keep things in proportion. How to take care in five easy steps  first of all  you can use natural ventilation. You can use body breath. You should stay cool with the appropriate clothing. You should care about your posture    this is not right. Can you extract from Chris another minute and a half for me  because I have a video I have to show you. You are great. This is the correct posture. Another benefit of Wi Fi  we learned yesterday about the benefits of Wi Fi. Wi Fi enables you to avoid the processor. And there are some enhanced protection measures  which I would like to share with you  and I would like  in a minute  to thank Philips for helping. This is a research which was done in '    but it's still valid. Scrotal temperature reflects intratesticular temperature and is lowered by shaving. By the way  I must admit  my English is not so good  I didn't know what is scrotal  I understand it's a scrotum. I guess in plural it's scrotal  like medium and media. Digital scrotum  digital media. And only last year I recognized that I'm a proud scrotum owner. And this research is being precipitated by the U.S. government  so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes. Video  Man  The Philips Bodygroom has a sleek  ergonomic design for a safe and easy way to trim those scruffy underarm hairs  the untidy curls on and around your  bleep   as well as the hard to reach locks on the underside of your  bleep  and  bleep . Once you use the Bodygroom  the world looks different. And so does your  bleep . These days  with a hair free back  well groomed shoulders and an extra optical inch on my  bleep   well  let's just say life has gotten pretty darn cozy. Yossi Vardi  This is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year  known as the optical inch by Philips. Let's applaud Philips       for this gesture for humanity. And this is how they are promoting the product. This is    I didn't touch it  this is original. Laptop use to solve overpopulation. And if everything failed  there are some secondary uses. And then our next talk  our next TED if you invite me will be why you should not carry a cell phone in your pocket. And this is what the young generation says. And I just want to show you that I'm not just preaching  but I also practice.   am in the morning. You cannot use this picture. Now  I have some mini TED Prizes  this is the Philips Bodygroom  one for our leader. Anybody feels threatened  anybody really need it  Any lady  any lady  Thank you very much. I study ants  and that's because I like to think about how organizations work. And in particular  how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization. So  ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that  and there are many others. The web is one. There are many biological systems like that    brains  cells  developing embryos. There are about        species of ants. They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens  and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers. And all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control. Nobody tells anybody what to do. The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management. No ant directs the behavior of any other ant. And I try to figure out how that works. And I've been working for the past    years on a population of seed eating ants in southeastern Arizona. Here's my study site. This is really a picture of ants  and the rabbit just happens to be there. And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds. This is the nest of the mature colony  and there's the nest entrance. And they forage maybe for about    meters away  gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest  and store them. And every year I go there and make a map of my study site. This is just a road. And it's not very big  it's about     meters on one side      on the other. And every colony has a name  which is a number  which is painted on a rock. And I go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before  and figure out which ones have died  and put all the new ones on the map. And by doing this I know how old they all are. And because of that  I've been able to study how their behavior changes as the colony gets older and larger. So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony. Ants never make more ants  colonies make more colonies. And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives    those are the ones with wings    on a mating flight. So every year  on the same day    and it's a mystery exactly how that happens    each colony sends out its virgin  unmated queens with wings  and the males  and they all fly to a common place. And they mate. And this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings. And she's in the process of mating with this male  and there's another male on top waiting his turn. Often the queens mate more than once. And after that  the males all die. That's it for them. And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere  drop their wings  dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs. And they will live for    or    years  continuing to lay eggs using the sperm from that original mating. So the queen goes down in there. She lays eggs  she feeds the larvae    so an ant starts as an egg  then it's a larva. She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves. Then  as soon as the ants    the first group of ants    emerge  they're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants. They go out  they get the food  they dig the nest  and the queen never comes out again. So this is a one year old colony    this happens to be    . There's the nest entrance  there's a pencil for scale. So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer. This is a three year old colony. There's the nest entrance  there's a pencil for scale. They make a midden  a pile of refuse    mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat. This is a five year old colony. This is the nest entrance  here's a pencil for scale. This is about as big as they get  about a meter across. And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes    so this is about        worker ants    changes as a function of colony age  in years. So it starts out with zero ants  just the founding queen  and it grows to a size of about    or    thousand ants when the colony is five. And it stays that size until the queen dies and there's nobody to make more ants  when she's about    or    years old. And it's when they reach this stable size  in numbers of ants  that they start to reproduce. That is  to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight. And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants.  Laughter  So that's not the most fun part of this research  although it's interesting. Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation. That's not just how is the colony organized  but how does it change what it's doing  How is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change  So  things happen to an ant colony. When it rains in the summer  it floods in the desert. There's a lot of damage to the nest  and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess. When extra food becomes available    and this is what everybody knows about picnics    then extra ants are allocated to collect the food. So  with nobody telling anybody what to do  how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task  And that's the process that I call task allocation. And in harvester ants  I divide the tasks of the ants I see just outside the nest into these four categories  where an ant is foraging  when it's out along the foraging trail  searching for food or bringing food back. The patrollers    that's supposed to be a magnifying glass    are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active. They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go  and by coming back    just by making it back    they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out. Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest  and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house. That is  that there are chambers inside  they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe like surface in it. It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area. And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest  and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles. So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand  put it down  turn around  and go back in. And finally  the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage. So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse. On one day  it'll all be here  and then the next day they'll move it over there  and then they'll move it back. So that's what the midden workers do. And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest. So that's only about    percent of the colony  and they're the oldest ants. So  an ant starts out somewhere near the queen. And when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep as the colony is wide  so about a meter deep for the big old nests. And then there's another long tunnel and a chamber  where we often find the queen  after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes. I don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes  but instead because when there's flooding  occasionally the colony has to go down deep. So there's this whole network of chambers. The queen's in there somewhere  she just lays eggs. There's the larvae  and they consume most of the food. And this is true of most ants    that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating. They bring it back and feed it to the larvae. When the foragers come in with food  they just drop it into the upper chamber  and other ants come up from below  get the food  bring it back  husk the seeds  and pile them up. There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest. And curiously  and interestingly  it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing. So  despite what it says in the Bible  about  you know   Look to the ant  thou sluggard   in fact  you could think of those ants as reserves. That is to say  if something happened    and I've never seen anything like this happen  but I've only been looking for    years    if something happened  they might all come out if they were needed. But in fact  mostly they're just hanging around in there. And I think it's a very interesting question    what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing  And they sort of stand as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside. And if you mark ants that are working outside  and dig up a colony  you never see them deep down. So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger. They somehow get into this reserve. And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce. And once they belong to the ants that work outside  they never go back down. Now ants    most ants  including these  don't see very well. They have eyes  they can distinguish between light and dark  but they mostly work by smell. So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true    you know  even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do  there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest. So that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony. So when I first set out to work on task allocation  my first question was   What's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks  Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing  Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing   And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others  knowing its place on the assembly line. And instead I wanted to ask   How are the different task groups interdependent   So I did experiments where I changed one thing. So for example  I created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance  early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active. This is what it looks like about    minutes later. Here it is about    minutes later. And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there. And what I wanted to know was   OK  here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited    is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks   Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked. So here's some blue nest maintenance workers. And lately we've gotten more sophisticated and we have this three color system. And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which. We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers  and they work really well. And so just to summarize the result  well it turns out that yes  the different tasks are interdependent. So  if I change the numbers performing one task  it changes the numbers performing another. So for example  if I make a mess that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up  then I see fewer ants out foraging. And this was true for all the pair wise combinations of tasks. And the second result  which was surprising to a lot of people  was that ants actually switch tasks. The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life. So for example  if I put out extra food  everybody else    the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food  they become foragers. The nest maintenance workers become foragers. The patrollers become foragers. But not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works. Like I just said  if there is more food to collect  the patrollers  the midden workers  the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage. If there's more patrolling to do    so I created a disturbance  so extra patrollers were needed    the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol. But if more nest maintenance work is needed    for example  if I put out a bunch of toothpicks    then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance  they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest. So foraging acts as a sink  and the ants inside the nest act as a source. And finally  it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not. So  for example  when there's extra nest maintenance work to do  it's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that. But the foragers somehow decide not to come out. And here was the most intriguing result  the task allocation. This process changes with colony age  and it changes like this. When I do these experiments with older colonies    so ones that are five years or older    they're much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic. The worse things get  the more I hassle them  the more they act like undisturbed colonies. Whereas the young  small colonies    the two year old colonies of just       ants    are much more variable. And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year. It could be this year  or this year. So  the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony. It's not due to the experience of older  wiser ants. Instead  something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older. And the obvious thing that's changing is its size. So since I've had this result  I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kinds of decision rules    very simple  local  probably olfactory  chemical rules could an ant could be using  since no ant can assess the global situation    that would have the outcome that I see  these predictable dynamics  in who does what task. And it would change as the colony gets larger. And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact. So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae. They smell with their antennae. When one ant touches another  it's smelling it  and it can tell  for example  whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other  through grooming  with a layer of grease  which carries a colony specific odor. And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts  the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks  in deciding what to do. And so what the message is  is not any message that they transmit from one ant to another  but the pattern. The pattern itself is the message. And I'll tell you a little bit more about that. But first you might be wondering  how is it that an ant can tell  for example  I'm a forager. I expect to meet another forager every so often. But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers  I'm less likely to forage. So it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker. And we've learned that  in this species    and I suspect in others as well    these hydrocarbons  this layer of grease on the outside of ants  is different as ants perform different tasks. And we've done experiments that show that that's because the longer an ant stays outside  the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change  and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks. And they can use that task specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons    they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks. And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads  and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate. And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it  as they would to contact with real ants. So I want now to show you a bit of film    and this will start out  first of all  showing you the nest entrance. So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance. They've gone out to do different tasks  and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines  or influences  each ant's decision about whether to go out  and which task to perform. This is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest. In the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope. But the idea is that the ants are in there  and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it    a stream of contacts with other ants. And the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out  and what it does when it comes back out. You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these. Each ant  then  as it comes back in  is contacting other ants. And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip  are contacting the ants coming in. So  what's interesting about this system is that it's messy. It's variable. It's noisy. And  in particular  in two ways. The first is that the experience of the ant    of each ant    can't be very predictable. Because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside. And the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting. So  we do a lot of simulation and modeling  and also experimental work  to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to  in the aggregate  produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies. Again  I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork. In fact  if you watch ants at all  you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it. So it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts  perfection arises. But it works pretty well. Ants have been around for several hundred million years. They cover the earth  except for Antarctica. Something that they're doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts  in the aggregate  produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants. And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns    this network of interaction patterns    to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies. So the one thing  though  that I want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size. The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony    and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule  like  I expect to meet another forager every three seconds.  But in a small colony  it's likely to meet fewer foragers  just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet. So this is the kind of rule that  as the colony develops and gets older and larger  will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one. Thank you. I wanna start today    here's my thing. Hold on. There I go. Hey. I wanna start today    talk about the structure of a polypeptide.  Laughter  I get a lot of people asking me  in terms of  Lost   you know   What the hell's that island   You know  it's usually followed by   No  seriously  what the hell is that island   Why so many mysteries  What is it about mystery that I seem to be drawn to  And I was thinking about this  what to talk about at TED. When I talked to the kind rep from TED  and I said   Listen  you know  what should I talk about   He said   Don't worry about it. Just be profound.  So thank you  if you're here. I was trying to think  what do I talk about  It's a good question. Why do I do so much stuff that involves mystery  And I started trying to figure it out. And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do  and I started thinking about my grandfather. I loved my grandfather. Harry Kelvin was his name  my mother's father. He died in     . He was an amazing guy. And one of the reasons he was amazing  After World War II he began an electronics company. He started selling surplus parts  kits  to schools and stuff. So he had this incredible curiosity. As a kid I saw him come over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things. And he'd open them up  he'd unscrew them  and reveal the inner workings    which many of us  I'm sure  take for granted. But it's an amazing gift to give a kid. To open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is. He was the ultimate deconstructer  in many ways. And my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart  but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts  like  you know  printing  like the letter press. I'm obsessed with printing. I'm obsessed with silk screening and bookbinding and box making. When I was a kid  I was always  like  taking apart boxes and stuff. And last night in the hotel  I took apart the Kleenex box. I was just looking at it. And I'm telling you ...  Laughter  It's a beautiful thing. I swear to God. I mean  when you look at the box  and you sort of see how it works. Rives is here  and I met him years ago at a book fair  he does pop up books. And I'm obsessed with  like  engineering of paper. But like  the scoring of it  the printing of it  where the thing gets glued  you know  the registration marks for the ink. I just love boxes. My grandfather was sort of the guy who  you know  kind of got me into all sorts of these things. He would also supply me with tools. He was this amazing encourager    this patron  sort of  to make stuff. And he got me a Super   camera when I was    years old. And in       that was sort of an anomaly  to be a    year old kid that had access to a camera. And you know  he was so generous  I couldn't believe it. He wasn't doing it entirely without some manipulation. I mean  I would call him  and I'd be like   Listen  Grandpa  I really need this camera. You don't understand. This is  like  you know  I want to make movies. I'll get invited to TED one day. This is like       Laughter  And you know  and my grandmother was the greatest. Because she'd be like  you know    she'd get on the phone. She'd be like   Harry  it's better than the drugs. He should be doing      She was fantastic.  Laughter  So I found myself getting this stuff  thanks to her assist  and suddenly  you know  I had a synthesizer when I was    years old    this kind of stuff. And it let me make things  which  to me  was sort of the dream. He sort of humored my obsession to other things too  like magic. The thing is  we'd go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen's Magic. It was this great magic store. It was a crappy little building in Midtown  but you'd be in the elevator  the elevator would open    there'd be this little  small magic store. You'd be in the magic store. And it was just  it was a magical place. So I got all these sort of magic tricks. Oh  here. I'll show you. This is the kind of thing. So it would be like  you know. Right  Which is good  but now I can't move. Now  I have to do this  the rest of the thing  like this. I'm like   Oh  wow. Look at my computer over there    Laughter  Anyway  so one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this  Tannen's Mystery Magic Box. The premise behind the mystery magic box was the following     dollars buys you    dollars worth of magic. Which is a savings.  Laughter  Now  I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding. If you look at this  you'll see it's never been opened. But I've had this forever. Now  I was looking at this  it was in my office  as it always is  on the shelf  and I was thinking  why have I not opened this  And why have I kept it  Because I'm not a pack rat. I don't keep everything but for some reason I haven't opened this box. And I felt like there was a key to this  somehow  in talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before  and bored people elsewhere. So I thought  maybe there's something with this. I started thinking about it. And there was this giant question mark. I love the design  for what it's worth  of this thing. And I started thinking  why haven't I opened it  And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important    to me. It represents my grandfather. Am I allowed to cry at TED  Because    no  I'm not going to cry. But     Laughter     the thing is  that it represents infinite possibility. It represents hope. It represents potential. And what I love about this box  and what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do  is I find myself drawn to infinite possibility  that sense of potential. And I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination. Now  it's not the most ground breaking idea  but when I started to think that maybe there are times when mystery is more important than knowledge  I started getting interested in this. And so I started thinking about  Lost   and the stuff that we do  and I realized  oh my God  mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do  In how    in the creation of  Lost   Damon Lindelof and I  who created the show with me  we were basically tasked with creating this series that we had very little time to do. We had    and a half weeks to write it  cast it  crew it  shoot it  cut it  post it  turn in a two hour pilot. So it was not a lot of time. And that sense of possibility    what could this thing be  There was no time to develop it. I'm sure you're all familiar with those people who tell you what you can't do and what you should change. And there was no time for that  which is kind of amazing. And so we did this show  and for those of you who  you know  who haven't seen it  or don't know it  I can show you this one little clip from the pilot  just to show you some stuff that we did. Claire  Help  Please help me  Help me  Help me  Jack  Get him out of here  Get him away from the engine  Get him out of here  C  I'm having contractions  J  How many months pregnant are you  C  I'm only eight months. J  And how far apart are they coming  C  I don't know. I think it just happened. Man  Hey  Hey  Hey  get away from    JJA  Now     years ago  if we wanted to do that  we'd have to kill a stuntman. We'd actually     Laughter  it would be harder. It would take    Take   would be a bitch. So the amazing thing was  we were able to do this thing. And part of that was the amazing availability of technology  knowing we could do anything. I mean  we could never have done that. We might have been able to write it  we wouldn't have been able to depict it like we did. And so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process  technology is  like  mind blowingly inspiring to me. I realize that that blank page is a magic box  you know  It needs to be filled with something fantastic. I used to have the  Ordinary People  script that I'd flip through. The romance of the script was amazing to me  it would inspire me. I wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script did. You know  I love Apple computers. I'm obsessed. So the Apple computer    like those    the PowerBook    this computer  right  it challenges me. It basically says  what are you going to write worthy of me   Laughter  I guess I feel this    I'm compelled. And I often am like  you know  dude  today I'm out. I got nothing. You know   Laughter  So there's that. In terms of the content of it  you look at stories  you think  well  what are stories but mystery boxes  There's a fundamental question    in TV  the first act is called the teaser. It's literally the teaser. It's the big question. So you're drawn into it. Then of course  there's another question. And it goes on and on. Look at  Star Wars.  You got the droids  they meet the mysterious woman. Who's that  We don't know. Mystery box  You know  Then you meet Luke Skywalker. He gets the Droid  you see the holographic image. You learn  oh  it's a message  you know. She wants to  you know  find Obi Wan Kenobi. He's her only hope. But who the hell's Obi Wan Kenobi  Mystery box  So then you go and he meets Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi. Holy shit  You know    so it keeps us    So there's this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled. Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination    the withholding of information. You know  doing that intentionally is much more engaging. Whether it's like the shark in  Jaws     if Spielberg's mechanical shark  Bruce  had worked  it would not be remotely as scary  you would have seen it too much. In  Alien   they never really showed the alien  terrifying  Even in a movie  like a romantic comedy   The Graduate   they're having that date  remember  And they're in the car  and it's loud  and so they put the top up. They're in there    you don't hear anything they're saying  You can't hear a word  But it's the most romantic date ever. And you love it because you don't hear it. So to me  there's that. And then  finally  there's this idea    stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit    but the idea of the mystery box. Meaning  what you think you're getting  then what you're really getting. And it's true in so many movies and stories. And when you look at  E.T.   for example     E.T.  is this  you know  unbelievable movie about what  It's about an alien who meets a kid  right  Well  it's not.  E.T.  is about divorce.  E.T.  is about a heartbroken  divorce crippled family  and ultimately  this kid who can't find his way.  Die Hard   right  Crazy  great  fun  action adventure movie in a building. It's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce. He's showing up to L.A.  tail between his legs. There are great scenes    maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time  but pretty great scenes. There's a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you're  you know  expecting. When you look at a movie like  Jaws   the scene that you expect    we have the screen  These are the kind of  you know  scenes that you remember and expect from  Jaws.  And she's being eaten  there's a shark. The thing about  Jaws  is  it's really about a guy who is sort of dealing with his place in the world    with his masculinity  with his family  how he's going to  you know  make it work in this new town. This is one of my favorite scenes ever  and this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of when you think of  Jaws.  But it's an amazing scene. Father  C'mere. Give us a kiss. Son  Why  Father  'Cause I need it. JJA  C'mon.  Why  'Cause I need it   Best scene ever  right  Come on  So you think of  Jaws     so that's the kind of stuff that  like  you know  the investment of character  which is the stuff that really is inside the box  you know  It's why when people do sequels  or rip off movies  you know  of a genre  they're ripping off the wrong thing. You're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster. You gotta rip off    you know  if you rip something off    rip off the character. Rip off the stuff that matters. I mean  look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you. Because ultimately  you know  the mystery box is all of us. So there's that. Then the distribution. What's a bigger mystery box than a movie theater  You know  You go to the theater  you're just so excited to see anything. The moment the lights go down is often the best part  you know  And you're full of that amazing    that feeling of excited anticipation. And often  the movie's  like  there and it's going  and then something happens and you go   Oh    and then something else  and you're   Mmm ...  Now  when it's a great movie  you're along for the ride 'cause you're willing to give yourself to it. So to me  whether it's that  whether it's a TV  an iPod  computer  cell phone    it's funny  I'm an    as I said  Apple fanatic    and one day  about a year or so ago  I was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs' keynote  'cause I always do. And he came on  he was presenting the video iPod  and what was on the enormous iPod behind him   Lost   I had no idea  And I realized  holy shit  it'd come full circle. Like  the inspiration I get from the technology is now using the stuff that I do  inspired by it  to sell technology. I mean  it's nuts   Laughter  I was gonna show you a couple of other things I'm gonna skip through. I just want to show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything. This is something online  I don't know if you've seen it before. Six years ago they did this. This is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience. But the point was  that they were doing things that were using these mystery boxes that they had    everyone has now. What I've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid  everyone has access to now. You don't need to have my grandfather  though you wished you had. But I have to tell you    this is a guy doing stuff on a Quadra     computer    the resolution's a little bit low    using Infinity software they stopped making    years ago. He's doing stuff that looks as amazing as stuff I've seen released from Hollywood. The most incredible sort of mystery  I think  is now the question of what comes next. Because it is now democratized. So now  the creation of media is    it's everywhere. The stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid is now ubiquitous. And so  there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there. And when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would have been silenced  you know    who have been silenced in the past    it's a very exciting thing. I used to say in classes and lectures and stuff  to someone who wants to write   Go  Write  Do your thing.  It's free  you know  you don't need permission to go write. But now I can say   Go make your movie   There's nothing stopping you from going out there and getting the technology. You can lease  rent  buy stuff off the shelf that is either as good  or just as good  as the stuff that's being used by the  you know  quote unquote  legit people.  No community is best served when only the elite have control. And I feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there. When I did  Mission  Impossible III   we had amazing visual effects stuff. ILM did the effects  it was incredible. And sort of like my dream to be involved. And there are a couple of sequences in the movie  like these couple of moments I'll show you. There's that. Okay  obviously I have an obsession with big crazy explosions. So my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you. And it's a scene in which Tom's character wakes up. He's drowsy. He's crazy    out of it. And the guy wakes up  and he shoves this gun in his nose and shoots this little capsule into his brain that he's going to use later to kill him  as bad guys do. Bad Guy  Good morning. JJA  OK  now. When we shot that scene  we were there doing it  the actor who had the gun  an English actor  Eddie Marsan    sweetheart  great guy    he kept taking the gun and putting it into Tom's nose  and it was hurting Tom's nose. And I learned this very early on in my career  Don't hurt Tom's nose.  Laughter  There are three things you don't want to do. Number two is  Don't hurt Tom's nose. So Eddie has this gun    and he's the greatest guy    he's this really sweet English guy. He's like   Sorry  I don't want to hurt you.  I'm like    you gotta    we have to make this look good. And I realized that we had to do something 'cause it wasn't working just as it was. And I literally  like  thought back to what I would have done using the Super   camera that my grandfather got me sitting in that room  and I realized that hand didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's. It could be Tom's. And Tom would know just how hard to push the gun. He wouldn't hurt himself. So we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie's. We put it in Eddie's sleeve  and so the hand that you see    I'll show you again  that's not Eddie's hand  that's Tom's. So Tom is playing two roles.  Laughter  And he didn't ask for any more money. So here  here. Watch it again. There he is. He's waking up. He's drowsy  been through a lot. Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand.  Laughter  Anyway. So. Thanks. So you don't need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies. And the mystery box  in honor of my grandfather  stays closed. Thank you.  Applause  We're going to go on a dive to the deep sea  and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down  it's a perfectly positively pitch black world. And we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn't describe  these blinking lights    a world of bioluminescence  like fireflies. Dr. Edith Widder    she's now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association    was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals  and that's what you're seeing here on the screen. That's all bioluminescence. Like I said  just like fireflies. There's a flying turkey under a tree. I'm a geologist by training. But I love that. And you see  some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten  some they use to attract prey  but all of it  from an artistic point of view  is just positively amazing. And a lot of what goes on inside    There's a fish with glowing eyes  pulsating eyes. Some of the colors are designed to hypnotize  these lovely patterns. And then this last one  one of my favorites  this pinwheel design. Just absolutely amazing  every single dive. That's the unknown world  and today we've only explored about   percent of what's out there in the ocean. Already we've found the world's highest mountains  the world's deepest valleys  underwater lakes  underwater waterfalls    a lot of that we shared with you from the stage. And in a place where we thought no life at all  we find more life  we think  and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest  which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all. There's still    percent  and either that    percent is empty or just full of surprises. But I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing. Cephalopods    head foots. As a kid I knew them as calamari  mostly. This is an octopus. This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab  and it's just fascinating how cephalopods can  with their incredible eyes  sense their surroundings  look at light  look at patterns. Here's an octopus moving across the reef  finds a spot to settle down  curls up and then disappears into the background. Tough thing to do. In the next bit  we're going to see a couple squid. Now males  when they fight  if they're really aggressive  they turn white. And these two males are fighting. They do it by bouncing their butts together  which is an interesting concept. Now  here's a male on the left and a female on the right  and the male has managed to split his coloration so the female only always sees the kinder  gentler squid in him. Let's take a look at it again. Watch the coloration  white on the right  brown on the left. He takes a step back  he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body  and comes up on the other side    Bingo  Now  I'm told that's not not just a squid phenomenon with males  but I don't know. Cuttlefish. I love cuttlefish. This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish. And there he is  his droopy little eyes up here. But they can do pretty amazing things  too. Here we're going to see one backing into a crevice  and watch his tentacles    he just pulls them in  makes them look just like algae. Disappears right into the background. Positively amazing. Here's two males fighting. Once again  they're smart enough  these cephalopods  they know not to hurt each other. But look at the patterns that they can do with their skin. That's an amazing thing. Here's an octopus. Sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move  because predators can see them. This guy can make himself look like a rock  and  looking at his environment  can actually slide across the bottom  using the waves and the shadows so he can't be seen. His motion blends right into the background    the moving rock trick. So  we're learning lots new from the shallow water. Still exploring the deep  but learning lots from the shallow water. There's a good reason why  the shallow water's full of predators    here's a barracuda    and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod  you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide. In the next scene  you're going to see a nice coral bottom. And you see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage  use your skin to change color and texture. Here's some algae in the foreground    and an octopus. Ain't that amazing  Now  Roger spooked him  so he took off in a cloud of ink  and when he lands  the octopus says   Oh  I've been seen. The best thing to do is to get as big as I can get.  That big brown makes his eyespot very big. So  he's bluffing. Let's do it backwards. I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me. I thought it was all graphics. So here it is in reverse. Watch the skin color  watch the skin texture. Just an amazing animal  it can change color and texture to match the surroundings. Watch him blend right into this algae. One  two  three. And now he's gone  and so am I. Thank you very much. Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be. And in my idea  heaven is satisfied curiosity. I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down  like I was watching TV when I was a child  and my elbows up. And I can basically look everywhere I want  see every movie I've always wanted to see. And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you're reading  there's something really soothing and easy. Well  the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life  in a way  because I discovered ... it took me a while to understand it  but when I discovered around    years of age that I was much more comfortable with objects than with people  I finally decided to really embrace this passion. And I basically live my life in sort of a trance  and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story. Just to give you an example  this is the exhibition  Humble Masterpieces  as it was at MoMA in     . We were in Queens  we were building the big  big  big  big building in Midtown  so we were in the small  small  small boondocks. That was one of the funnest moments of my career. But it's not only that. The typeface    the typeface is Helvetica  it's its   th anniversary this year. And so I start thinking    Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together  trying to outdo Akzidenz Grotesk  and come up with a new sans serif typeface    and the movie starts playing in my head already. And of course  you can imagine  with Humble Masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred. And I do hope  by the way  that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you. The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ... you know when they do homeworks at home  Instead of having a tray with two peas  I was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag and do their museum quality design collection on a tray. So  everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces  and at MoMA we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces. And when you do that  usually you get    percent porn and    percent real suggestions  and instead it was all    almost    all good suggestions. And a lot of nationalism came in. For instance  I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop  but they were very proud so every Spaniard said  la frego.  And Italians did the pizza. And I wanted to show you  also  the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good    they had moonshine  laundry detergents and liquid nails. And I keep it going  and I just got  also  this suggestion from Milan  it's our traffic divider  which we call  panettone   and it's painted  it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan to define all the lanes of traffic. So  think of your own  send them on if you want to    they're always welcome. But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I've been thinking of for    years ever since I got to MoMA. I'm Italian. In Italy  design is normal. Different parts of the world have a knack for different things. I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay  and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you don't see elsewhere  but the contemporary art was terrible. In Italy  in Milan especially  contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place. But design    oh  my God. What you find at the store at the corner  without going to any kind of fancy store  is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated. It's just what you find at the store. And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art. I'm always amazed    three year olds know who Richard Serra is and take you to the galleries. But design  for some reason  is still misunderstood for decoration. It's really interesting  what many people think when I say the word  design  is they think of this kind of overdesigned    in this case  it's overdesigned on purpose  but    decoration  interior decoration. They think of somebody choosing fabrics. Design can be that  of course  but it can also be this. It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people  because  as you know  Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies. So  what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline  so that instead of being completely strangled  a teenager can also sip a Coke. They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important. And then they make a little tent for the baby. However cruel  however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design  and it is miles away from the fancy furniture  but still  it's part of my same field of passion. What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to harness the power of MoMA because it's great to work there. You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions  and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors. I'm very well aware that    percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse  and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there. But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in       which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better. There have been many episodes  and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience  but in two instances  his great grandfather  grandfather    I'm always a little perplexed about the relation  exactly    Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions  one in       it was about organic furniture  and the second one in      was low cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture. And then there was good design for very low price. There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life. So  I started out in '   with this exhibition that was called Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design. It was about a new phase  in my opinion  in the world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves. And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California  at that time  they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market. And at the same time  the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro  who did these beautiful salt and pepper containers that are made of rice dough. So you see  the range is really quite diverse. And then  for instance  this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in       where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time. And you see IDEO there. It was beautiful    it was called Personal Skies. The idea was that if you had a cubicle  you could project a sky on top of your head and have your own  Cielo in Una Stanza     a sky in a room    it's a very famous Italian song. And other examples  this was Marti Guixe about working on the go  and Hella Jongerius  my favorite  about how to work at home. And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design  designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world. What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs  current conditions in economy  in materials  in sustainability issues  and then what they do at the end    if they are good    is much more than the sum of its parts. Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious. The idea behind her work was that at that time  everybody was saying you have to really divide your life. Instead  she said   No  no. Work and leisure can be together.  Yeah  that's particularly gorgeous    it's the TV dinner of     . There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime  but I don't want to focus on my shows. I would like  instead  to talk about how great some designers are. I've always had a hard time with the word  maverick.  I came to the United States    years ago  and to this day I have to ask   What does that mean   So  this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle. Therefore  he was not following everybody's lead  and therefore  he was a maverick. So  designers do need to be mavericks  because the best way to design a successful object    and also an object that we were missing before    is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it. So  Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA and it ended at the beginning of last year. It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection. It's a long story because it started before      and it was called Emergency. And then when      happened  I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition until  slowly but surely  it came back    as a half full glass instead of half empty    and it was about protection and safety. But it ranged from such items as a complete de mining equipment to these kind of water sterilizing straws  so it was really wide ranging. It also had ... you know  Cameron and I worked a little bit together  and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition. But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore  design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point. It's a sense of economy and a sense  also  of humor. This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland  who's South African. It's a suit for civil disobedience. The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you  you're wearing this thing    it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified    and the police is reminded  it's like having a flower in front of the rifle. And also  you can imagine  a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police. So  designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional  but they're functional to our understanding of issues. Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia  like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away  or even better  the huggable atomic mushroom  which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States    I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA  or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations. But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self  and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic. This is Cindy van den Bremen  who is a Dutch designer that's done this series of Capsters. They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski  play tennis  do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves. And sometimes by doing this kind of research  you encounter such beautiful ideas of design. Twan Verdonck is really young  I think he's     and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments. They're quite beautiful. They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you    because autistic children like to be hugged tight  so it has a spring inside    all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self. Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges. I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul. And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury  and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality. And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury  and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much. I want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy    very  very clear limits. This is Cuba  and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell  and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks. So they're quite beautiful  but they're beautiful because they're so smart and economical. And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo  Fernando and Humberto Campana  who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money. But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself. So really  design takes everything into account  and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances  as we become more and more wireless and impalpable  designers  instead  want us to be hands on. Sometimes hammer on. This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically. Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint  all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona. From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes. It's quite beautiful because somehow  this is a gorgeous moment for design. Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna  whose name was Marchetti  explain how the innovation in the military industry    therefore  secret innovation    and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed. And that makes sense. In moments of war there's great technological innovation  and in the world you have to do without    well  during the Second World War  you had to do without steel  you had to do without aluminum. And then as peace comes  all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market. Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance  fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden. I think that this is a strange moment. The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously  just like the rhythm of our life in the past    years  so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is. But it surely is a very important moment for design  because not only is the technology proceeding  not only is computing technology making open source possible also in the world of design  but also the idea of sustainability    which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO  emissions and footprint  but also sustainability of human interrelationships    is very much part of the work of so many designers. And that's why designers  more and more  are working on behaviors rather than on objects. Especially the good ones  not all of them. I wanted to show you  for instance  the work of Mathieu Lehanneur  which is quite fantastic. He's another young designer from France who's working    and at this point he's working  also  with pharmaceutical companies    on new ways to engage patients  especially children  in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty. For instance  this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine  so the child has to go    pffff     to release and relieve the container itself. And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin  so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery. Similarly  there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste  orally. The next show that I'm going to work on    and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here    is about the relationship between design and science. I'm trying to find not the metaphors  but  rather  the points in common    the common gripes  the common issues  the common preoccupations    and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction  as a direction rather than a prescription of form. And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this. I've sent an email already to quite a few of you. But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales  and therefore  really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful. Thank you.  Applause  Frank Gehry  I listened to this scientist this morning. Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments  and I realized that I almost became a scientist. When I was    my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water. So  I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator  and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in. And the glass    luckily I turned around    I had it all in my back and I was about    feet away. The wall was covered with ... I had an explosion. Richard Saul Wurman  Really  FG  People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay. RSW  ... huh.  Laughter  I'd like to start this session again. The gentleman to my left is the very famous  perhaps overly famous  Frank Gehry. And Frank  you've come to a place in your life  which is astonishing. I mean it is astonishing for an artist  for an architect  to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time. I mean you have become  whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny ... you know  it's a strange thought  but your building is an icon    you can draw a little picture of that building  it can be used in ads    and you've had not rock star status  but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life. And I know the road was extremely difficult. And it didn't seem  at least  that your sell outs  whatever they were  were very big. You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody. But that's an interesting thing for a creative person. A lot of us work for people  we're in the hands of other people. And that's one of the great dilemmas    we're in a creativity session    it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity  how to do work that's big enough and not sell out. And you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big  triply big. It's not quite a question but you can comment on it. It's a big issue. FG  Well  I've always just ... I've never really gone out looking for work. I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head. And when I started out  I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff. And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff  and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars. But I couldn't do anything else. That was my response to the people in the time. And actually  it was responding to clients that I had who didn't have very much money  so they couldn't afford very much. I think it was circumstantial. Until I got to my house  where the client was my wife. We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like    grand I built a house around it. And a few people got excited about it. I was visiting with an artist  Michael Heizer  out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere. He's building this huge concrete place. And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink. We were standing out in the desert all alone and  thinking about my house  he said   Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent  somewhere in      years somebody's going to like it   So  I thought   Yeah  that's probably a good idea.  Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money  so the stuff was a little more permanent. But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long  this guy was telling us the other day. So where do we go now  Back to    everything's so temporary. I don't see it the way you characterized it. For me  every day is a new thing. I approach each project with a new insecurity  almost like the first project I ever did  and I get the sweats  I go in and start working  I'm not sure where I'm going    if I knew where I was going  I wouldn't do it. When I can predict or plan it  I don't do it. I discard it. So I approach it with the same trepidation. Obviously  over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK. I do run a kind of a business    I've got     people and you've got to pay them  so there's a lot of responsibility involved    but the actual work on the project is with  I think  a healthy insecurity. And like the playwright said the other day    I could relate to him  you're not sure. When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it  I saw all the mistakes  I saw ... They weren't mistakes  I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it. I felt an embarrassment     How could I have done that  How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that   It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say    as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street  and it appears to have a relationship    that I started to like it. RSW  What's the status of the New York project  FG  I don't really know. Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me  and I thought he was nuts. I didn't think he knew what he was doing  and he pulled it off. So  I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy. He gets up there and then he ... comes back up. They're still talking about it. September    generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero  and I'm totally against that. I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time. RSW  The picture on the screen  is that Disney  FG  Yeah. RSW  How much further along is it than that  and when will that be finished  FG  That will be finished in         September  October    and I'm hoping Kyu  and Herbie  and Yo Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place. Luckily  today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like. Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me. He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time. There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients. If you think about the world  and even just in this audience  most of us are involved with buildings. Nothing that you would call architecture  right  And so to find one  a guy like that  you hang on to him. He's become the head of Art Center  and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there. I knew Craig and respected him. They want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that    it's a beautiful  minimalist  black steel building    and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it's a lot of acreage. I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal  Alvaro Siza. RSW  Why did you want that  FG  I knew you'd ask that question. It was intuitive. Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture. I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work  and his early work had a resemblance to my early work. When I came out of college  I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California  and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that. I tried to understand that language as a beginning  as a place to jump off  and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ... I just stopped. I mean  Charlie Moore did a bunch of it  but it didn't feel good to me. Siza  on the other hand  continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language. And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building. I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out. I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you. I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra  who doesn't think architecture is art. Did you see that thing  RSW  No. What did he say  FG  He calls architecture  plumbing.  FG  Anyway  the Siza thing. It's a richer experience. It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians    it's similar to that I would imagine    where you ... huh  Audience  Liquid architecture. FG  Liquid architecture. Where you ... It's like jazz  you improvise  you work together  you play off each other  you make something  they make something. And I think for me  it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city. RSW  Is it going to be near the current campus  Or is it going to be down near ... FG  No  it's near the current campus. Anyway  he's that kind of patron. It's not his money  of course. RSW  What's his schedule on that  FG  I don't know. What's the schedule  Richard  Richard Koshalek   Unclear  starts from     . FG      . You can come to the opening. I'll invite you. No  but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos  right  Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment  and if you can figure out how to work off each other    if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other  you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect. Like the Rockefeller Center model  which is kind of from another era. RSW  I found the most remarkable thing. My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building  you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces. I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED. The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city. That was the surprise of going across the river  of going on the highway around it  of walking down the street and finding it. That was the real surprise of Bilbao. FG  But you know  Richard  most architects when they present their work    most of the people we know  you get up and you talk about your work  and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying   Look  I'm worried about the context  I'm worried about the city  I'm worried about my client  I worry about budget  that I'm on time.  Blah  blah  blah and all that stuff. And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ... by saying all that  it means your work is good somehow. And I think everybody    I mean that should be a matter of fact  like gravity. You're not going to defy gravity. You've got to work with the building department. If you don't meet the budgets  you're not going to get much work. If it leaks    Bilbao did not leak. I was so proud. The MIT project    they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao. I met them in Bilbao. They came for three days. RSW  This is the computer building  FG  Yeah  the computer building. They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around    I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things  and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden  you know  People put buckets out ... I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place  it was just fantastic. But you've got to    yeah  well up until then every building leaked  so this ... RSW  Frank had a sort of ... FG  Ask Miriam  RW  ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while. FG  You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story  when the woman called and said   Mr. Wright  I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head.  And he said   Madam  move your chair.  So  some years later I was doing a building  a little house on the beach for Norton Simon  and his secretary  who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady  called me and said   Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk and the water's coming in on his head.  And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story. RSW  Didn't get a laugh. FG  No. Not now either. But my point is that ... and I call it the  then what   OK  you solved all the problems  you did all the stuff  you made nice  you loved your clients  you loved the city  you're a good guy  you're a good person ... and then what  What do you bring to it  And I think that's what I've always been interested in  is that    which is a personal kind of expression. Bilbao  I think  shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city. That's what reminded me of it. And I think that's the issue  you know  it's the  then what  that most clients who hire architects    most clients aren't hiring architects for that. They're hiring them to get it done  get it on budget  be polite  and they're missing out on the real value of an architect. RSW  At a certain point a number of years ago  people    when Michael Graves was a fashion  before teapots ... FG  I did a teapot and nobody bought it. RSW  Did it leak  FG  No. RSW  ... people wanted a Michael Graves building. Is that a curse  that people want a Bilbao building  FG  Yeah. Since Bilbao opened  which is now four  five years  both Krens and I have been called with at least     opportunities    China  Brazil  other parts of Spain    to come in and do the Bilbao effect. And I've met with some of these people. Usually I say no right away  but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings. In one case  I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city  and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port. I asked them what kind of building it was.  When you get here we'll explain it.  Blah  blah  blah. So four of us went. And they took us    they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay  and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor. Each one was more beautiful than the other. And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga. Just before going to lunch with the mayor  we went to the harbor commissioner. It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here  and I was here  and my guys. We sat down  and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet. And the guy looked at me and said   Now what can I do for you  Mr. Gehry   RSW  Oh  my God. FG  So  I got up. I said to my team   Let's get out of here.  We stood up  we walked out. They followed    the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said   You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor   I said   Nope.   You're not going to have dinner at all   They just brought us there to hustle this group  you know  to create a project. And we get a lot of that. Luckily  I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel. I don't have my own plane yet. RSW  Well  I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long. But let me just say a couple words. FG  Can I say something  Are you going to talk about me or you  RSW  Once a shit  always a shit  FG  Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody  so ... RSW  You're going to get one  You're going to get one  I'm going to make it for you  FG  No  no. Wait a minute  It's really quite an honor to be here tonight  and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened because I've really been inspired. And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are  literally  world premieres. I've been working on my new record and I've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone. This is a song that I wrote about the meaning of technology  which goes perfectly with this gathering. I started thinking about    when I was in college  especially as a blind person  doing a research paper was a major undertaking. You had to go to the library  see if you could get them to find the books for you  you know  footnotes and all that. Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up. I wish I had that when I was in college. Anyway  this is a song about  we have all this  but what are we going to do with it  It's called  All the Answers.    What is the weather in Cincinnati      What is the time in Tokyo      Who is this little child's daddy      And who the hell needs to know      Why do memories of you linger     when I'm trying to reach my goal      And why must I move my fingers     to the music in my soul      I don't know.     I don't have to know.     'Cause here I go ...     and I got all the answers     right here in my hand.     And I got all the answers     and I don't have to understand     'cause I got all the answers.     Think I'll rummage through the century     while I listen to the sea.     Oh  it's good to be so free      so free.     Who was mayor of Chicago     back in           And why did Shakespeare create Iago     to tear apart a love so pure      How can my dreams be so vivid     in a psychosonic way      Why must I become so livid     about the news I hear today      I don't know.     I don't have to know.     And here I go ...     'cause I got all the answers     right here in my hand.     And I got all the answers.     See  I don't have to understand     'cause I got all the answers.     I think I'll browse on through     the tabloid news     while I sip my tea.     Mm  it's good to be so free.     I never ever have to be alone.     I can do it all right here in my home.     Yeah  mm hmm ...     Everything that's ever been known      I can punch it up right here on my phone.     Freedom train  coming soon     right here in my living room     from Baton Rouge to Saskatoon     and all points in between.     'Cause I got all the answers     right here on my screen.     And I got all the answers  yeah.     I got every book and magazine.     I got all  I got all  I got all ...     I got all the answers      all the answers  oh yeah.     Uh huh ...     But I tell you what I'm going to do      I'm going to find the capitol of Peru     or the latitude of Kathmandu.     I'm gonna Google it     'cause everybody's doing it.     And then I'll rummage through the century.     I got all  I got all  I got all ...     I got all the answers.     Yeah  yeah     I got all the answers.   Thank you. Whew  It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song. That's the first time I've ever played it. It's a  feel the fear and do it anyway  kind of thing. This next song is a song that started out as a dream    a childhood dream. It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record  except there's a couple of problems. One thing is  it's unpronounceable. And it's a made up word. It's called  Tembererana.  And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces. So  tembererana  was these dreams  in which I would be running away from bad feelings    is the only way I can put it. So this is called  Tembererana.  It's based on an Argentinian rhythm called  carnivalito.    A dream within a dream      a world within a world      the sound of a primal scream     travels out across the land.     Images flickering      the sound of the war machine      a procession of limousines     travels slowly across the land.     Another child could use a hand.     Reaching out from within     tembererana  hey  tembererana ...     Annihilation moves.     The earth is an open tomb.     The sound of the final boom     rumbles fiercely across the land.     Fear  you're the enemy.     Obliterating all but thee.     You see what you want to see.     Before I'm blinded  I will toast     the shade of power that I love most      the power of creation.     Tembererana  hey  tembererana ...     Da  da  da  da     Da  da  da  da  da  da  da     As a child  alone and afraid      escaping the impressions every feeling made      I would run  run away     into a world where the good was the aim of the game     and the sum of invisible power     had a name.     It's the same name.     Tembererana  hey  tembererana ...     Da  da  da  da  da  da  da     Tembere  tembere  tembere  tembererana     Tembere  tembere  tembere  tembererana  hey     Tembererana  hey     Tembererana ...   It's a great honor to be here with you. The good news is I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar. And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech  but I have a box of slides. I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living. I've learned through experience that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words  and so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes. The whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead. And on a Wednesday afternoon  I was walking down the corridor of my high school kind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching  who made a great big old ceramic vessel  and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room    and if you've ever seen clay done  it's magic    and I'd never seen anything like that before in my life. So  I walked in the art room and I said   What is that   And he said   Ceramics. And who are you   And I said   I'm Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that.  And he said   Well  get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that says you can come here  and I'll teach it to you.  And so for the remaining two years of my high school  I cut all my classes. But I had the presence of mind to give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made  and they gave me passing grades. And that's how I got out of high school. And Mr. Ross said   You're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience  so I'm leaving this school and I'm taking you with me.  And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation. Well  I'm now a trustee of the university  and at my installation ceremony I said   I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation. Don't give up on the poor kids  because you never know what's going to happen to those children in life.  What I'm going to show you for a couple of minutes is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh with the highest crime rate. One is called Bidwell Training Center  it is a vocational school for ex steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers. You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh  Well  we don't make any steel anymore  and the people who used to make the steel are having a very tough time of it. And I rebuild them and give them new life. Manchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood. I was adopted by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots  and he donated a row house. And in that row house I started Manchester Craftsmen's Guild  and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians  there's money in very close proximity. And the Bishop adopted me as his kid. And last year I spoke at his memorial service and wished him well in this life. I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright  the architect  and I asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh. And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport. And when you come to Pittsburgh    and you're all invited    you'll be flying into the blown up version of my building. That's the building. Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead. My view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on  you have to look like the solution and not the problem. As you can see  it has a fountain in the courtyard. And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one and I had the checkbook  so I bought one and put it there. And now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED  I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum. At a reception in their courtyard  I noticed that they had a fountain because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain. Well  I think that welfare mothers and at risk kids and ex steel workers deserve a fountain in their life. And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you    water is life and water of human possibility    and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech. So  from that fountain I built this building. As you can see  it has world class art  and it's all my taste because I raised all the money. I said to my boy   When you raise the money  we'll put your taste on the wall.  That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns  there's something beautiful looking back at you  that's deliberate. That's intentional. In my view  it is this kind of world that can redeem the soul of poor people. We also created a boardroom  and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto  Japan  and commissioned him to do    pieces of furniture for our building. We have since spun him off into his own business. He's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people. And I got    pieces out of it for my school because I felt that welfare moms and ex steel workers and single parents deserved to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day. Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech. We even have flowers in the hallway  and they're not plastic. Those are real and they're in my building every day. And now that I've given lots of speeches  we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me  and they said   Mr. Strickland  what an extraordinary story and what a great school. And we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there.  I said   Well  I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there.  You don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids. What you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life. The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge. And so in my building  which is full of sunlight and full of flowers  we believe in hope and human possibilities. That happens to be at Christmas time. And so the next thing you'll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the Heinz company    you've heard of them  They did all right in the ketchup business. And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz  who was our U.S. senator    who was tragically killed in a plane accident    he had heard about my desire to build a new building  because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site. And he called me into his office    which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz and John Heinz had     million dollars  and at the time I had about    cents. And he said   But we've heard about you. We've heard about your work with the kids and the ex steel workers  and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building. And you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program.  Because back then  we were building a trades program. He said   That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the Heinz company.  I said   Senator  I'm reluctant to go into a field that I don't know much about  but I promise you that if you'll support my school  I'll get it built and in a couple of years  I'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire.  And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said   Well  what would your reaction be if I said I'd give you a million dollars   I said   Senator  it appears that we're going into the food training business.  And John Heinz did give me a million bucks. And most importantly  he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company. And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America  which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools  and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city. And we've never looked back. I would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen. That happens to be our cafeteria line. That's puff pastry day. Why  Because the students made puff pastry and that's what the school ate every day. But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food. That good food's not for rich people    good food's for everybody on the planet  and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it. So at my school  we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs  but it's better for their heads. Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place I call my center. We have students who sit together  black kids and white kids  and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment  because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way. These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing after six months in the training program. No sophistication  no class  no dignity  no history. What we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they don't have any money  which happens to be a curable condition. It's all in the way that you think about people that often determines their behavior. That was done by a student after seven months in the program  done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef. I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good. They have no calories. That's our dining room. It looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in America. But this is my view of how students ought to be treated  particularly once they have been pushed aside. We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry  we train medical technicians for the medical industry  and we train chemical technicians for companies like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon. And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh    and you're all invited    you'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators    months from enrolling in the program. There is absolutely no reason why poor people can't learn world class technology. What we've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie's music  and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time. We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry. We even teach people how to read. The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago    he's now an instructor. And I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read. And so you must ask yourself the question  how is it possible in the   st century that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands  The reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end  not the children who read. I can take these children and in    weeks  demonstrated aptitude  I can get them high school equivalent. No big deal. That's our library with more handcrafted furniture. And this is the arts program I started in     . Remember I'm the black kid from the '  s who got his life saved with ceramics. Well  I went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood  the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm  you can bring them right back to life. I have     kids from the Pittsburgh public school system that come to me every day of the week for arts education. And these are children who are flunking out of public school. And last year I put    percent of those kids in college and I've averaged over    percent for    years. We've made a fascinating discovery  there's nothing wrong with the kids that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm and Herbie's music can't cure. For that I won a big old plaque    Man of the Year in Education. I beat out all the Ph.D.'s because I figured that if you treat children like human beings  it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way. And why we can't institute that policy in every school and in every city and every town remains a mystery to me. Let me show you what these people do. We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging. And these are all kids with no artistic ability  no talent  no imagination. And we bring in the world's greatest artists    Gordon Parks has been there  Chester Higgins has been there    and what we've learned is that the children will become like the people who teach them. In fact  I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican  an African American woman who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques  and let me show you what they did with the work. These were children who the whole world had given up on  who were flunking out of public school  and that's what they're capable of doing with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence. We teach photography. And these are examples of some of the kids' work. That boy won a four year scholarship on the strength of that photograph. This is our gallery. We have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery  so I designed this thing. We have smoked salmon at the art openings  we have a formal printed invitation  and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come. I couldn't buy a parent    years ago so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time. He was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the Lord. And I said   Bill  I want to hire you  man. You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit  but keep the enthusiasm. I can't get these parents to come to the school.  He said   I'll get them to come to the school.  So  he jumped in the van  he went to Miss Jones' house and said   Miss Jones  I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening but you probably didn't have a ride. So  I came to give you a ride.  And he got    parents and then    parents. At the last show that we did      parents showed up and we didn't pick up one parent. Because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild because people think you're bad parents. And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents. Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated  every time  every town  every city. I wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets. And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school  they've got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it's all up here. You have to change the way that people see themselves before you can change their behavior. And it's worked out pretty good up to this day. I even stuck another room on the building  which I'd like to show you. This is brand new. We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference. I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley and I did all right. And the woman came out of the audience  she said   That was a great story and I was very impressed with your presentation. My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old.  And I said   Well  what do you do for a living   She said   Well  I work for a company called Hewlett Packard.  And I said   You're in the computer business  is that right   She said   Yes  sir.  And I said   Well  there's an easy solution to that problem.  Well  I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP and a furniture company called Steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the United States of America. And that's the room that's initiating the relationship. We got it just done in time to show you  so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center. I only have a couple more slides  and this is where the story gets kind of interesting. So  I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here. In       I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while I was building it. And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here  Marty Ashby. And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check on a Wednesday afternoon  and I said   Dizzy  why would you come to a black run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn't even have a reputation in music   He said   Because I heard you built the center and I didn't believe that you did it  and I wanted to see for myself. And now that I have  I want to give you a gift.  I said   You're the gift.  He said   No  sir. You're the gift. And I'm going to allow you to record the concert and I'm going to give you the music  and if you ever choose to sell it  you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school.  And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later  but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing. And he showed up and said   Dizzy talking about you all over the country  man  and I want to help you.  And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up. Then a bass player named Ray Brown  and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine  and a piano player named Herbie Hancock  and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra  and a fellow named Tito Puente  and a guy named Gary Burton  and Shirley Horn  and Betty Carter  and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city. And I'm very pleased to tell you that  with their permission  I have now accumulated     recordings of the greatest artists in the world  including Joe Williams  who died  but not before his last recording was done at my school. And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said   God's picked you  man  to do this work. And I want my music to be with you.  And that worked out all right. When the Basie band came  the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music. And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy. And like a fool  I didn't go to the ceremony because I didn't think we were going to win. Well  we did win  and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden. Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back. So  we've become one of the hot  young jazz recording studios in the United States of America in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate. That's the place all filled up with Republicans. If you'd have dropped a bomb on that room  you'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania because it was all sitting there. Including my mother and father  who lived long enough to see their kid build that building. And there's Dizzy  just like I told you. He was there. And he was there  Tito Puente. And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there and they recorded with us. And that was our first recording studio  which was the broom closet. We put the mops in the hallway and re engineered the thing and that's where we recorded the first Grammy. And this is our new facility  which is all video technology. And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson  who recorded that album at our school last Christmas. And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey on Christmas Day  he was there and Nancy was there singing excerpts from this album  the rights to which she donated to our school. And I can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell        CDs. We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts  right behind Tony Bennett. And I think we're going to be fine. This was burned out during the riots    this is next to my building    and so I had another cardboard box built and I walked back out in the streets again. And that's the building  and that's the model  and on the right's a high tech greenhouse and in the middle's the medical technology building. And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done. It's also full of anchor tenants at    dollars a foot    triple that in the middle of the inner city. And there's the fountain. Every building has a fountain. And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants and they took half the building  and we now train medical technicians through all their system. And Mellon Bank's a tenant. And I love them because they pay the rent on time. And as a result of the association  I'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation that bought Dreyfus. And this is in the process of being built as we speak. Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse that's going to open in October this year because we're going to grow those flowers in the middle of the inner city. And we're going to have high school kids growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city. And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids in all     stores in six states. And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu  California  who are Hispanic. So  the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city. And I told my United States senator that there was a very high probability that if he could find some funding for this  we would become a left hand column in the Wall Street Journal  to which he readily agreed. And we got the funding and we open in the fall. And you ought to come and see it    it's going to be a hell of a story. And this is what I want to do when I grow up. The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake. I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park    which is less than       feet from the riverfront    for four million dollars and I didn't do it. And I built the first building  and guess what happened  I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody's expectations and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year  and said   Mr. Strickland  you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award because you've appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations. Thank you very much for that.  The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams  just in case they do come true. And finally  there's this picture. This is in a place called San Francisco. And the reason this picture's in here is I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit  and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me. He said   Man  that's a great story. I want one of those.  I said   Well  I'm very flattered. What do you do for a living   He says   I run the city of San Francisco. My name's Willie Brown.  And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind. And that weekend  I was going back home and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night    first time I'd met him. And he walked in and he says   What is this   And I said   Herbie  this is my concept of a training center for poor people.  And he said   As God as my witness  I've had a center like this in my mind for    years and you've built it. And now I really want to build one.  I said   Well  where would you build this thing   He said   San Francisco.  I said   Any chance you know Willie Brown   As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown  and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago  and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth. And Willie Brown said   As sure as I'm the mayor of San Francisco  I'm going to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people of this city.  And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board  and our friends from HP  and our friends from Steelcase  and our friends from Cisco  and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech. And along the way  I met this real short guy at my slide show in the Silicon Valley. He came up to me afterwards  he said   Man  that's a fabulous story. I want to help you.  And I said   Well  thank you very much for that. What do you do for a living   He said   Well  I built a company called eBay.  I said   Well  that's very nice. Thanks very much  and give me your card and sometime we'll talk.  I didn't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano  but I had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center. I said   Hey man  what is eBay   He said   Well  that's the electronic commerce network.  I said   Well  I met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card.  So  I called him up on the phone and I said   Mr. Skoll  I've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are and I'd like to become your friend.  And Jeff and I did become friends  and he's organized a team of people and we're going to build this center. And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview Hunters Point  and I said   The mayor sent me down here to work with you and I want to build a center with you  but I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it. And all I've got is a box of slides.  And so I stood up in front of     very angry  very disappointed people on a summer night  and the air conditioner had broken and it was     degrees outside  and I started showing these pictures. And after about    pictures they all settled down. And I ran the story and I said   What do you think   And in the back of the room  a woman stood up and she said   In    years of living in this God forsaken place  you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity. I'm going with you  man.  And she turned that audience around on a pin. And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing  and we're going to build it all right. And I think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh. But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way and I showed him the box of slides. And Quincy said   I want to help you  man. Let's do one in L.A.  And so he's assembled a group of people. And I've fallen in love with him  as I have with Herbie and with his music. And Quincy said   Where did the idea for centers like this come from   And I said   It came from your music  man. Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums when I was    years old in the pottery class  when the world was all dark  and your music got me to the sunlight.  And I said   If I can follow that music  I'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK. And if that's not true  how did I get here   I want you all to know that I think the world is a place that's worth living. I believe in you. I believe in your hopes and your dreams  I believe in your intelligence and I believe in your enthusiasm. And I'm tired of living like this  going into town after town with people standing around on corners with holes where eyes used to be  their spirits damaged. We won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around. In Pennsylvania it costs        dollars to keep people in jail  most of whom look like me. It's        dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School. It's        dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail. Do the math    it will never work. I am banking on you and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard and very decent people who still believe in something. And I want to do this in my lifetime  in every city and in every town. And I don't think I'm crazy. I think we can get home on this thing and I think we can build these all over the country for less money than we're spending on prisons. And I believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope. In my business it's very difficult work. You're always fighting upstream like a salmon    never enough money  too much need    and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work. And so I've figured out  over time  the solution to the depression  you make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely. And my hope is that I've made a few here tonight. And thanks for listening to what I had to say.  J  napot  pac k  Which  as somebody here must surely know  means  What's up  guys   in Magyar  that peculiar non Indo European language spoken by Hungarians for which  given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet  few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago. But there it is   J  napot  pac k  I said somebody here must surely know  because despite the fact that there aren't that many Hungarians to begin with  and the further fact that  so far as I know  there's not a drop of Hungarian blood in my veins  at every critical juncture of my life there has been a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside me. I even have dreams that take place in landscapes I recognize as the landscapes of Hungarian films  especially the early movies of Miklos Jancso. So  how do I explain this mysterious affinity  Maybe it's because my native state of South Carolina  which is not much smaller than present day Hungary  once imagined a future for itself as an independent country. And as a consequence of that presumption  my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army  an experience that has befallen many a Hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history. Or maybe it's because when I was a teenager back in the '  s  my uncle Henry    having denounced the Ku Klux Klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard  living under death threat    took his wife and children to Massachusetts for safety and went back to South Carolina to face down the Klan alone. That was a very Hungarian thing to do  as anyone will attest who remembers     . And of course  from time to time Hungarians have invented their own equivalent of the Klan. Well  it seems to me that this Hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for  but ultimately I ascribe it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness  with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado. It's not a typical mindset for most Americans  but it is perforce typical of virtually all Hungarians. So   J  napot  pac k   I went back to South Carolina after some    years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the     s  with the reckless condescension of that era thinking I would save my people. Never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving. I labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate South Carolina  a Methodist affiliated institution of higher learning called Wofford College. I knew nothing about Wofford and even less about Methodism  but I was reassured on the first day that I taught at Wofford College to find  among the auditors in my classroom  a    year old Hungarian  surrounded by a bevy of middle aged European women who seemed to function as an entourage of Rhinemaidens. His name was Sandor Teszler. He was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead and whose grandchildren lived far away. In appearance  he resembled Mahatma Gandhi  minus the loincloth  plus orthopedic boots. He had been born in      in the provinces of the old Austro Hungarian Empire  in what later would become Yugoslavia. He was ostracized as a child  not because he was a Jew    his parents weren't very religious anyhow    but because he had been born with two club feet  a condition which  in those days  required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and   . He went to the commercial business high school as a young man in Budapest  and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success. And after graduation when he went into textile engineering  the success continued. He built one plant after another. He married and had two sons. He had friends in high places who assured him that he was of great value to the economy. Once  as he had left instructions to have done  he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants. The night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks    it was a hosiery mill  and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was shoveling in mountains of socks. Mr. Teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said   But why do you steal from me  If you need money you have only to ask.  The night watchman  seeing how things were going and waxing indignant  said   Well  we're going to call the police  aren't we   But Mr. Teszler answered   No  that will not be necessary. He will not steal from us again.  Well  maybe he was too trusting  because he stayed where he was long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria and even after the arrests and deportations began in Budapest. He took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets that could be worn about the necks of himself and his family. And then one day  it happened  he and his family were arrested and they were taken to a death house on the Danube. In those early days of the Final Solution  it was handcrafted brutality  people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river. But none who entered that death house had ever come out alive. And in a twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film    the Gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill. It was a brutal beating. And midway through that brutality  one of Mr. Teszler's sons  Andrew  looked up and said   Is it time to take the capsule now  Papa   And the Gauleiter  who afterwards vanishes from this story  leaned down and whispered into Mr. Teszler's ear   No  do not take the capsule. Help is on the way.  And then resumed the beating. But help was on the way  and shortly afterwards a car arrived from the Swiss Embassy. They were spirited to safety. They were reclassified as Yugoslav citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the War  surviving burnings and bombings and  at the end of the War  arrest by the Soviets. Probably  Mr. Teszler had gotten some money into Swiss bank accounts because he managed to take his family first to Great Britain  then to Long Island and then to the center of the textile industry in the American South. Which  as chance would have it  was Spartanburg  South Carolina  the location of Wofford College. And there  Mr. Teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success  especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double knit. And then in the late     s  in the aftermath of Brown v. Board of Education  when the Klan was resurgent all over the South  Mr. Teszler said   I have heard this talk before.  And he called his top assistant to him and asked   Where would you say  in this region  racism is most virulent    Well  I don't rightly know  Mr. Teszler. I reckon that would be Kings Mountain.   Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there.  The man did as he was told  and shortly afterwards  Mr. Teszler received a visit from the white mayor of Kings Mountain. Now  you should know that at that time  the textile industry in the South was notoriously segregated. The white mayor visited Mr. Teszler and said   Mr. Teszler  I trust you re going to be hiring a lot of white workers.  Mr. Teszler told him   You bring me the best workers that you can find  and if they are good enough  I will hire them.  He also received a visit from the leader of the black community  a minister  who said   Mr. Teszler  I sure hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours.  He got the same answer   You bring the best workers that you can find  and if they are good enough  I will hire them.  As it happens  the black minister did his job better than the white mayor  but that's neither here or there. Mr. Teszler hired    men  eight white  eight black. They were to be his seed group  his future foremen. He had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain  and for two months these    men would live and work together  mastering the new process. He gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility and he asked if there were any questions. There was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet  and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said   Well  yeah. We ve looked at this place and there's only one place to sleep  there's only one place to eat  there's only one bathroom  there's only one water fountain. Is this plant going to be integrated or what   Mr. Teszler said   You are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region and this is how we do business. Do you have any other questions    No  I reckon I don't.  And two months later when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers  white and black  poured in to see the facility for the first time  they were met by the    foremen  white and black  standing shoulder to shoulder. They toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions  and inevitably the same question arose   Is this plant integrated or what   And one of the white foremen stepped forward and said   You are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business. Do you have any other questions   And there were none. In one fell swoop  Mr. Teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the South. It was an achievement worthy of Mahatma Gandhi  conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint. In his eighties  Mr. Teszler  having retired from the textile industry  adopted Wofford College  auditing courses every semester  and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved  becoming affectionately known as  Opi     which is Magyar for grandfather    by all and sundry. Before I got there  the library of the college had been named for Mr. Teszler  and after I arrived in       the faculty decided to honor itself by naming Mr. Teszler Professor of the College    partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses in the catalog  but mainly because he was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us. To me  it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little Methodist college in upstate South Carolina was a Holocaust survivor from Central Europe. Wise he was  indeed  but he also had a wonderful sense of humor. And once for an interdisciplinary class  I was screening the opening segment of Ingmar Bergman's  The Seventh Seal.  As the medieval knight Antonius Block returns from the wild goose chase of the Crusades and arrives on the rocky shore of Sweden  only to find the specter of death waiting for him  Mr. Teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students. And as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight in a ghastly embrace  I heard Mr. Teszler's tremulous voice   Uh oh   he said   This doesn't look so good.   Laughter  But it was music that was his greatest passion  especially opera. And on the first occasion that I visited his house  he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to. And I delighted him by rejecting  Cavalleria Rusticana  in favor of Bela Bartok's  Bluebeard's Castle.  I love Bartok's music  as did Mr. Teszler  and he had virtually every recording of Bartok's music ever issued. And it was at his house that I heard for the first time Bartok's Third Piano Concerto and learned from Mr. Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville  North Carolina in the last year of the composer's life. He was dying of leukemia and he knew it  and he dedicated this concerto to his wife  Dita  who was herself a concert pianist. And into the slow  second movement  marked  adagio religioso   he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring  he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part. And clearly this composition is his final statement to her    it was first performed after his death    and through her to the world. And just as clearly  it is saying   It's okay. It was all so beautiful. Whenever you hear this  I will be there.  It was only after Mr. Teszler's death that I learned that the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale  New York was paid for by Sandor Teszler.  J  napot  Bela   Not long before Mr. Teszler s own death at the age of     he heard me hold forth on human iniquity. I delivered a lecture in which I described history as  on the whole  a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality  and Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said   You know  Doctor  human beings are fundamentally good.  And I made a vow to myself  then and there  that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion  I would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow. And now he's dead  so I'm stuck with my vow.  J  napot  Sandor   I thought my skein of Hungarian mentors had come to an end  but almost immediately I met Francis Robicsek  a Hungarian doctor    actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte  North Carolina  then in his late seventies    who had been a pioneer in open heart surgery  and  tinkering away in his garage behind his house  had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures. He's also a prodigious art collector  beginning as an intern in Budapest by collecting   th  and   th century Dutch art and Hungarian painting  and when he came to this country moving on to Spanish colonial art  Russian icons and finally Mayan ceramics. He's the author of seven books  six of them on Mayan ceramics. It was he who broke the Mayan codex  enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on Mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script. On the occasion of my first visit  we toured his house and we saw hundreds of works of museum quality  and then we paused in front of a closed door and Dr. Robicsek said  with obvious pride   Now for the piece De resistance.  And he opened the door and we walked into a windowless    by    foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling  and crammed on every shelf his collection of Mayan ceramics. Now  I know absolutely nothing about Mayan ceramics  but I wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so I said   But Dr. Robicsek  this is absolutely dazzling.   Yes   he said.  That is what the Louvre said. They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece  but it was not a good one.   Laughter  Well  it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek to lecture at Wofford College on    what else     Leonardo da Vinci. And further  I should invite him to meet my oldest trustee  who had majored in French history at Yale some    odd years before and  at     still ruled the world's largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand. His name is Roger Milliken. And Mr. Milliken agreed  and Dr. Robicsek agreed. And Dr. Robicsek visited and delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success. And afterwards we convened at the President's House with Dr. Robicsek on one hand  Mr. Milliken on the other. And it was only at that moment  as we were sitting down to dinner  that I recognized the enormity of the risk I had created  because to bring these two titans  these two masters of the universe together    it was like introducing Mothra to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo. If they didn't like each other  we could all get trampled to death. But they did  they did like each other. They got along famously until the very end of the meal  and then they got into a furious argument. And what they were arguing about was this  whether the second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first.  Laughter  Mr. Milliken said it was not. Dr. Robicsek disagreed. I was still trying to take in the notion that these titans  these masters of the universe  in their spare time watch Harry Potter movies  when Mr. Milliken thought he would win the argument by saying   You just think it's so good because you didn't read the book.  And Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair  but quickly gathered his wits  leaned forward and said   Well  that is true  but I'll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild.   Well  yes  I did   conceded Mr. Milliken.  Aha   said Dr. Robicsek.  I went to the movie all by myself.   Laughter   Applause  And I realized  in this moment of revelation  that what these two men were revealing was the secret of their extraordinary success  each in his own right. And it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity  that irrepressible desire to know  no matter what the subject  no matter what the cost  even at a time when the keepers of the Doomsday Clock are willing to bet even money that the human race won't be around to imagine anything in the year       a scant    years from now.  Live each day as if it is your last   said Mahatma Gandhi.  Learn as if you'll live forever.  This is what I'm passionate about. It is precisely this. It is this inextinguishable  undaunted appetite for learning and experience  no matter how risible  no matter how esoteric  no matter how seditious it might seem. This defines the imagined futures of our fellow Hungarians    Robicsek  Teszler and Bartok    as it does my own. As it does  I suspect  that of everybody here. To which I need only add   Ez a mi munkank  es nem is keves.  This is our task  we know it will be hard.  Ez a mi munkank  es nem is keves. J  napot  pac k    Applause  Ladies and gentlemen  the history of music and television on the Internet in three minutes. A TED medley    a TEDley.   It's nine o' clock on a Saturday     The record store's closed for the night     So I fire up the old iTunes music store     And soon I am feelin' all right     I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody     With one dollar pricing that rocks     I can type in the track and get album names back     While still in my PJs and socks     Sell us a song  you're the music man     My iPod's still got    gigs to go     Yes  we might prefer more compatibility     But Steve likes to run the whole show     I heard  Desperate Housewives  was great last night     But I had a bad piece of cod     As I threw up my meal  I thought   It's no big deal      I'll watch it tonight on my 'Pod     And now all of the networks are joining in     Two bucks a show without ads     It's a business those guys always wanted to try     But only Steve Jobs had the 'nads     They say we're young  don't watch TV     They say the Internet is all we see     But that's not true  they've got it wrong     See  all our shows are just two minutes long     Hey     I got YouTube     I got YouTube   And now  ladies and gentlemen  a tribute to the Recording Industry Association of America    the RIAA    Young man  you were surfin' along     And then  young man  you downloaded a song     And then  dumb man  copied it to your 'Pod     Then a phone call came to tell you ...     You've just been sued by the R I A A     You've just been screwed by the R I A A     Their attorneys say you committed a crime     And there'd better not be a next time     They've lost their minds at the R I A A     Justice is blind at the R I A A     You're depriving the bands     You are learning to steal     You can't do whatever you feel     CD sales have dropped every year     They're not greedy  they're just quaking with fear     Yes indeedy  what if their end is near     And we download all our music     Yeah  that would piss off the R I A A     No plastic discs from the R I A A     What a way to make friends     It's a plan that can't fail     All your customers off to jail     Who'll be next for the R I A A      What else is vexing the R I A A      Maybe whistling a tune     Maybe humming along     Maybe mocking 'em in a song   I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums. I show a number of photographs and films  but I also make television programs  books and some advertising  all with the same concept. And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture  and the importance of the image  celebrity is born of photography. I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago  when Princess Diana died. There was a sort of a standstill in Britain the moment of her death  and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way. I was fascinated by this phenomenon  so I wondered  could one erase the image of Diana  actually quite crudely and physically  So  I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana  but I couldn't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche. Momentum was being built. The press wrote about her death in rather  I felt  pornographic ways    like   Which bit of artery left which bit of body   and  How did she die in the back of the car      and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism  so I made these rather gory images. I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image  so I got a look alike of Diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in  or existed in  the public imagination. So people were wondering  was she going to marry Dodi  Was she in love with him  Was she pregnant  Did she want his baby  Was she pregnant when she died  So I created this image of Diana  Dodi and their imaginary mixed race child and this image came out  which caused a huge public outcry at the time. I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery  so I started making reference to media imagery    made it grainy  shot through doorways and so on and so forth    to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism. So  this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband  and this was a sequence of images. And this gets shown in art galleries like this  as a sequence. And similarly with the Di Dodian baby imagery    this is another art gallery installation. I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception. This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs  for instance  but you think it's Camilla and the Queen  and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real. And the camera can lie  and it makes it very  very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths. So  I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter. And at the same time  it removes us from the real subject matter  and this acts as a sort of titillating thing. So  the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism  what you can't have  you want more. In the photograph  the real subject doesn't exist so it makes you want that person more. And that is the way  I think  that celebrity magazines work now  the more pictures you see of these celebrities  the more you feel you know them  but you don't know them and you want to know them further. Of course  the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ... watch her horses.  Laughter . And then I was sort of making imagery. In England there's an expression   you can't imagine the Queen on the loo.  So I'm trying to penetrate that. Well  here is the image. All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this  giving full pages about how terrible this was. Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle  I was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media    because we don't know the real people  very few of us know the real people    but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing  effectively  my filthy work. So  these are broadsheets  tabloids  debates were being had all about this work  films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work  politicians were getting involved    all sorts of things    great headlines. Then suddenly  it started to get on front pages. I was being asked and paid to do front covers. Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable  which I found also fascinating. How one moment    it was disgusting    journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me  saying my work was wonderful  and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me. But then this changed suddenly. I then started to work for magazines and newspapers. This was  for example  an image that went into Tatler. This was another newspaper image. It was an April fool actually  and to this day some people think it's real. I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day  and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen sitting outside William Hill. They thought it was real. I was exploring  at the time  the hyperbole of icons    and Diana and Marilyn    and the importance of celebrity in our lives. How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing  and how that should happen. I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself. There's me as Diana    I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley  I think  in this one.  Laughter . And me as the Queen. I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn    the biggest icon of all    and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth  and only showing certain angles to create a reality that  obviously  is completely constructed. This is the look alike  so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous. She looks nothing like Marilyn  but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on  she looks exactly like Marilyn  to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her    or recognize this look alike    in these photographs  which I find quite interesting. So  all this work is getting shown in art galleries. Then I made a book. I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time. Stills from the TV series went into this book. But there was a real legal problem because it looks real  but how do you get over that  Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now  that we can't tell what's real. How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not  So  from my point of view  it's important to publish it  but at the same time it does cause a confusion    intentional on my behalf  but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with. So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do  and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities and comments about our public figures. You know  what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru  And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about Bin Laden  Saddam Hussein  the links that were put about pre Iraq war. And what is going to happen to the monarchy  Because obviously the British public  I think  would prefer William to Charles on the throne. And it's that wish  or that desire  that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work. I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves. I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity. And with some look alikes  they are so good you don't know whether they're real or not. I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes  which is Coca Cola  and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities. It's highly commercial. But it was a difficulty for me    because this is my artwork  should I do advertising     at the time. So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same. But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on  you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that's all you're doing. When you take the logo off  you're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive  opposed to conclusive when you are advertising. This image is quite interesting  actually  because I think we made it three years ago. And it's Camilla in her wedding dress  which  again  nearly got re used now  recently prior to her wedding. Tony Blair and Cherie. And again  the legalities    we had to be very careful. It's obviously a very big commercial company  and so this little   Shh    it's not really them   was put on the side of the imagery. And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail. I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them  so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes    live scenes with look alikes inside the windows  and the windows were all steamed up. So  it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech  I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin  Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson  who he was having an affair with at that time. This was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper  broadsheets and tabloids. It was a bit of a road stopper  which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds  but huge fun    it was great for me to do a performance. Also  people were taking photographs of this  so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly  all this imagery. And the press were interviewing  and I was signing my book.  Laughter . Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen that I'm working on really for a sort of global market    my previous book was only for the U.K. market    that I suppose it could be called humorous. I suppose I come from a sort of non humorous background with serious intent  and then suddenly my work is funny. And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous  in a way  I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery. It's an extremely fast way of getting information. It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly  and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery. This image  for example  is sort of spot on because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private  and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein  and George Bush reading the Koran upside down. For example  George Bush target practice    shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore. And then you change the photograph he's shooting at  and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible.  Laughter . Tony Blair being used as a mounting block  and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind  and the seriousness  or the intellect  of Bush. And also  commenting on the behind the scenes    well  as we know now    what goes on in prisons. And in fact  George Bush and Tony Blair are having great fun during all of this. And really commenting  you know  based on the perception we have of the celebrities. What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life  and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and golf clubbed a driver the other day. I mean  it's extremely difficult to find these look alikes  so I'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs or films. And sometimes asking the real celebrity  mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person  which is highly embarrassing.  Laughter . I've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis    a page a week in their newspaper    which has been very interesting  working topically. So  Jamie Oliver and school dinners  Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture  the whole of the hunting issue  and the royal family refusing to stop hunting  and the tsunami issues  and obviously Harry  Blair's views on Gordon Brown  which I find very interesting  Condi and Bush. This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it. I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change  and there were a terrible thing that has happened  but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that. That's why this image was made one year ago  and what it means today. So  I'll leave you with these clips to have a look.  Music  Chris Anderson  Thank you. This is your conference  and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now  in this transition period  about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit. So  I'm just going to grab a chair here. Two years ago at TED  I think    I've come to this conclusion    I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion. I think that I may have believed unconsciously  then  that I was kind of a business hero. I had this company that I'd spent    years building. It's called Future  it was a magazine publishing company. It had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars  a number I didn't really understand. A magazine I'd recently launched called Business  .  was fatter than a telephone directory  busy pumping hot air into the bubble. And I was the    percent owner of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more. And all this had come from nothing. Fifteen years earlier  I was a science journalist who people just laughed at when I said   I really would like to start my own computer magazine.  And    years later  there are     of them and       people on staff and it was just such heady times. The date was February     . I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law    ever upward and to the right    it was going to go on forever. I mean  it had to. Right  I was in for quite a surprise. The dotcom  ironically called Snowball  was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before NASDAQ exploded  and I entered    months of business hell. I watched everything that I'd built crumbling  and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and    years work would have come for nothing. And it was gut wrenching. It took eight years of blood  sweat and tears to reach     employees  something which I was very proud of in the business. February         in one day we laid off     people  and before the bloodshed was finished        people had lost their jobs from my companies. I felt sick. I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day  every day  for    months. And worse than that  far worse than that  my sense of self worth was kind of evaporating. I was going around with this big sign on my forehead   LOSER.  And I think what disgusts me more than anything  looking back  is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing  Well  in the end  we were able to save Future and Snowball  but I was  at that point  ready to move on. And to cut a long story short  here's where I came to. And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe  from many conversations  that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster    emotional rollercoaster    in the last couple years. This has been a big  big transition time  and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next. The theme next year is re birth. It was at the same TED two years ago when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED. And at about the same time  and I think partly because of that  I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus  I started to read again. And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games  there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest  cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to ... all this stuff had changed. And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much  and it was incredibly exciting. And what was really most exciting    and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least    years before I did    was that all this stuff is connected. It's connected  it all hooks into each other. We talk about this a lot  and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So  just one example  Madame de Gaulle  the wife of the French president  was famously asked once   What do you most desire   And she answered   A penis.  And when you think about it  it's very true  what we all most desire is a penis    or  happiness  as we say in English. And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room. But something as basic as happiness  which    years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue  today it turns out that there's dozens of TED like questions that you can ask about it  which are really interesting. You can ask about what causes it biochemically  neuroscience  serotonin  all that stuff. You can ask what are the psychological causes of it  nature  Nurture  Current circumstance  Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind blowing. You can view it as a computing problem  an artificial intelligence problem  do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly  You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say  why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness  and whereas almost all the rest of them  regardless of how much money they have    whether it's two dollars a day or whatever    are almost equally happy on average  Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing  did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways  The ant's brain  parasitized  to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate  Are we the victims of a mass delusion  And so on  and so on. To understand even something as important to us as happiness  you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions  and there's nowhere that I've discovered    other than TED    where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions. And so  it's the profound thing that Richard talks about  to understand anything  you just need to understand the little bits  a little bit about everything that surrounds it. And so  gradually over these three days  you start off kind of trying to figure out   Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff   And at the end of the four days  your brain is humming and you feel energized  alive and excited  and it's because all these different bits have been put together. It's the total brain experience  we're going to ... it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage. Every mental organ addressed. It really is. Enough of the theory  Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do  all right  So  I will. Here's the vision for TED. Number one  do nothing. This thing ain't broke  so I ain't gonna fix it. Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me   Chris  TED is a really great conference. You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad.  So  I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason  and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with. Truth  curiosity  diversity  no selling  no corporate bullshit  no bandwagoning  no platforms. Just the pursuit of interest  wherever it lies  across all the disciplines that are represented here. That's not going to be changed at all. Number two  I am going to put together an incredible line up of speakers for next year. The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines. There's a year to do this  and already    I hope to show you a bit later    there's    or so terrific speakers signed up for next year. And I'm getting fantastic help from the community  this is just such a great community. And combined  our contacts reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country  if not the planet. It's true. Number three  I do want to  if I can  find a way of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit. And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club. Books kind of saved me in the last couple years  and that's a gift that I would like to pass on. So  when you sign up for TED      every six weeks you'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED. They may well be by a TED speaker  and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual  emotional journey. I think it will be great. And then  fourthly  I want to mention the Sapling Foundation  which is the new owner of TED. What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for. And more important  I think  the ideas that are exhibited and realized here are ideas that the foundation can use  because there's fantastic synergy. Already  just in the last few days  we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about  that they're passionate about  that can make a difference in the world  and the idea of getting this group of people together    some of the causes that we believe in  the money that this conference can raise and the ideas    I really believe that that combination will  over time  make a difference. I'm incredibly excited about that. In fact  I don't think  overall  that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life. I'm in this for the long run  and I would be greatly honored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me. I'm going to talk about two stories today. One is how we need to use market based pricing to affect demand and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions in the transportation sector. And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technologies  how we can generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce C   in the other sectors. I'm really scared. We need to reduce C   emissions in ten to fifteen years by    percent in order to avert catastrophic effects. And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that. What are catastrophic effects  A three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in    percent species extinction. It's not a movie. This is real life. And I'm really worried  because when people talk about cars    which I know something about    the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking   Let's use fuel efficient cars.  If we started today     years from now  at the end of this window of opportunity  those fuel efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent. That is not enough. But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things. Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes. So  Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago  but it's an example of something called car sharing. What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve  by the hour and by the day  instead of using their own car. How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar  It means that I pay only for what I need. All those hours when a car is sitting idle  I'm not paying for it. It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip. So  here's a woman that reserved MiniMia  and she had her day. I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients. I can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip. And the other remarkable thing is it's  I think  the highest status of car ownership. Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that I can have at my beck and call  but heaven forbid I would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it. It's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have. I get all the good stuff and none of the bad. So  what is the social result of this  The social result is that today's Zipcar has         members driving       cars parked in       parking spaces. Instead of driving        miles a year  which is what the average city dweller does  they drive     miles a year. Are they happy  The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it  or greater. People adore the company. And it's better  you know  They like it. So  how is it that people went from the        miles a year to     miles  It's because they said   It's eight to    dollars an hour and    dollars a day. If I'm going to go buy some ice cream  do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream  Or maybe I'll do without. Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand.  So  people really respond very quickly to it  to prices. And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology. It required that it was completely trivial  that it takes    seconds to reserve a car  go get it  drive it. And for me  as a service provider  I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything. So  without these wireless technologies  this  as a concept  could never happen. So  here's another example. This company is GoLoco    I'm launching it in about three weeks    and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing. This will apply to people across all of America. Today     percent of the trips are single occupancy vehicles  yet    percent of trips to work are currently carpool. And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems to completely change how people feel about ridesharing and make that trip much more efficient. And so when I think about the future  people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone is this incredibly great social event out of their day. You know  how did you get to TED  You went with other TEDsters. How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car  How did you go food shopping  You went with your neighbor  what a great social time. You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel  and it will also  I think  enhance our freedom of mobility. Where can I go today and who can I do it with  Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel. And the social benefits  the rate of single occupancy vehicles is  I told you     percent  I think we can get that down to    percent. The demand for parking  of course  is down  congestion and the CO  emissions. One last piece about this  of course  is that it's enabled by wireless technologies. And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this. The average American spends    percent of their income on their car  and there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost  yet they have no outlet today. So  the last example of this is congestion pricing  very famously done in London. It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads. In London  the day they turned the congestion pricing on  there was a    percent decrease in congestion overnight  and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing. And again  do people like the outcome  Ken Livingstone was reelected. So again  we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness to reduce their driving behavior. We've tripled the miles that we drive since      and doubled them since     . There's a huge slack in that system  with the right pricing we can undo that. Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world and is  again  wirelessly enabled. You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London and open and shut those gates. And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing. And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go  because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes. And as we get our cars more fuel efficient  that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes  so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive. Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies will be happening with road pricing. Why do we travel too much  Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over consumed. We need to put this better market feedback. And if we have it  you'll decide how many miles to drive  what mode of travel  where to live and work. And wireless technologies make this real time loop possible. So  I want to move now to the second part of my story  which is  when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing  Road pricing is coming. When are we going to do it  Are we going to wait    to    years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years  Because I'm going to say  that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight. And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use  This is my big vision. There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide  respond to emergencies  get traffic moving  provide a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce CO  emissions in every sector. And this is a moment from  The Graduate.  Do you remember this moment  You guys are going to be the handsome young guy and I'm going to be the wise businessman.  I want to say one word to you  just one word.   Yes  sir    Are you listening    Yes I am.   Ad hoc peer to peer self configuring wireless networks.  These are also called mesh networks. And in a mesh  every device contributes to and expands the network  and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before. I'm going to give you some examples. You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay. These laptops  when a child opens them up  they communicate with every single child in the classroom  within that school  within that village. And what is the cost of that communication system  Zero dollars a month. Here's another example  in New Orleans  video cameras were mesh enabled so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter. When the hurricane happened  the only communication system standing was the mesh network. Volunteers flew in  added a whole bunch of devices  and for the next    months  mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans. Another example is in Portsmouth  U.K. They mesh enabled     buses and they speak to these smart terminals. You can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street and when it's coming  and you can buy your tickets in real time. Again  all mesh enabled. Monthly communication cost  zero. So  the beauty of mesh networks  you can have these very low cost devices. Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable  you can just keep adding them  and as in Katrina  you can keep subtracting them    as long as there's some  we can still communicate. They're resilient  their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design. What are the incredible weaknesses  There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen    or in those municipalities  to build out their cities with these wireless networks    because there's zero ongoing communications cost. So  the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks  and networks are interesting only as they are big. How do we create a big network  Are you guys ready again     The Graduate   This time you will still play the handsome young thing  but I'll be the sexy woman. These are the next two lines in the movie.  Where did you do it    In his car.  So you know  when you stick this idea ...  Laughter  where would we expect me  Robin Chase  to be thinking is imagine if we put a mesh network device in every single car across America. We could have a coast to coast  free wireless communication system. I guess I just want you to think about that. And why is this going to happen  Because we're going to do congestion pricing  we are going to do road tolls  gas taxes are going to become road pricing. These things are going to happen. What's the wireless technology we're going to use  Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it  Maybe we shouldn't wait for the    or    years for this to happen. We should pull it forward. So  I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system  and require that this network be accessible to everyone  with open standards. Right now in the transportation sector  we're creating these wireless devices    I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane    that are single purpose devices in these closed networks. What is the point  We're transferring just a few little data bits when we're doing road controlling  road pricing. We have this incredible excess capacity. So  we can provide the lowest cost means of going wireless coast to coast  we can have resilient nationwide communication systems  we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors. Imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero. What you can do with that tool  we can create an economic engine. Information should be free  and access to information should be free  and we should be charging people for carbon. I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act  and I think this is as important and world changing to our economy as electrification. And if I had my druthers  we would have an open source version in addition to open standards. And this open source version means that it could be    if we did a brilliant job of it    it could be used around the world very quickly. So  going back to one of my earlier thoughts. Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network. When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize    his fabulous networks    imagine if there was an open source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks  to make all that happen. And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of things is going to be for free. We could make billions of dollars on top of it  but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source. So  let's take control of this nightmare  implement a gas tax immediately  transition across the nation to road tolling with this wireless mesh  require that the mesh be open to all  with open standards  and  of course  use mesh networks. Thank you.  Applause
