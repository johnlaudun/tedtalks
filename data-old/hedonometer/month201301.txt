One day in             miles off the coast of Chile  in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean     American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater. They'd been struck by a sperm whale  which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull. As their ship began to sink beneath the swells  the men huddled together in three small whaleboats. These men were        miles from home  more than       miles from the nearest scrap of land. In their small boats  they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water. These were the men of the whaleship Essex  whose story would later inspire parts of  Moby Dick.  Even in today's world  their situation would be really dire  but think about how much worse it would have been then. No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong. No search party was coming to look for these men. So most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves  but we all know what it's like to be afraid. We know how fear feels  but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean. As we grow up  we're often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness  just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates. And I think it's no accident that we think this way. Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard wired to be optimists. So maybe that's why we think of fear  sometimes  as a danger in and of itself.  Don't worry   we like to say to one another.  Don't panic.  In English  fear is something we conquer. It's something we fight. It's something we overcome. But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way  What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination  something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself  It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children  whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid. When I was a child  I lived in California  which is  you know  mostly a very nice place to live  but for me as a child  California could also be a little scary. I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake  and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night  terrified that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping. And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination. But at a certain point  most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up. We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed  and not every earthquake brings buildings down. But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults. The same incredible imaginations that produced  The Origin of Species    Jane Eyre  and  The Remembrance of Things Past   also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of Charles Darwin  Charlotte Bront   and Marcel Proust. So the question is  what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children  Well let's return to the year      for a moment  to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex. Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific. Twenty four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship. The time had come for the men to make a plan  but they had very few options. In his fascinating account of the disaster  Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth. The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the Marquesas Islands        miles away. But they'd heard some frightening rumors. They'd been told that these islands  and several others nearby  were populated by cannibals. So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner. Another possible destination was Hawaii  but given the season  the captain was afraid they'd be struck by severe storms. Now the last option was the longest  and the most difficult  to sail       miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of South America. But they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water. To be eaten by cannibals  to be battered by storms  to starve to death before reaching land. These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men  and as it turned out  the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died. Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name. What if instead of calling them fears  we called them stories  Because that's really what fear is  if you think about it. It's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do. And fears and storytelling have the same components. They have the same architecture. Like all stories  fears have characters. In our fears  the characters are us. Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends. You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails. Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel. Picture a cannibal  human teeth sinking into human skin  human flesh roasting over a fire. Fears also have suspense. If I've done my job as a storyteller today  you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship Essex. Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense. Just like all great stories  our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature  What will happen next  In other words  our fears make us think about the future. And humans  by the way  are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way  of projecting ourselves forward in time  and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling. As a writer  I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event in a story will affect all the other events  and fear works in that same way. In fear  just like in fiction  one thing always leads to another. When I was writing my first novel   The Age Of Miracles   I spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down. What would happen to our days  What would happen to our crops  What would happen to our minds  And then it was only later that I realized how very similar these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night. If an earthquake strikes tonight  I used to worry  what will happen to our house  What will happen to my family  And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story. So if we think of our fears as more than just fears but as stories  we should think of ourselves as the authors of those stories. But just as importantly  we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears  and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives. Now  some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others. I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs  and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called  productive paranoia   which meant that these people  instead of dismissing their fears  these people read them closely  they studied them  and then they translated that fear into preparation and action. So that way  if their worst fears came true  their businesses were ready. And sometimes  of course  our worst fears do come true. That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear. Once in a while  our fears can predict the future. But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct. So how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others  I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex offers an illuminating  if tragic  example. After much deliberation  the men finally made a decision. Terrified of cannibals  they decided to forgo the closest islands and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to South America. After more than two months at sea  the men ran out of food as they knew they might  and they were still quite far from land. When the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships  less than half of the men were left alive  and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism. Herman Melville  who used this story as research for  Moby Dick   wrote years later  and from dry land  quote   All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might in all human probability have been avoided had they  immediately after leaving the wreck  steered straight for Tahiti. But   as Melville put it   they dreaded cannibals.  So the question is  why did these men dread cannibals so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation  Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other  Looked at from this angle  theirs becomes a story about reading. The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments  the artistic and the scientific. A good reader has an artist's passion  a willingness to get caught up in the story  but just as importantly  the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist  which acts to temper and complicate the reader's intuitive reactions to the story. As we've seen  the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part. They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios. The problem was that they listened to the wrong story. Of all the narratives their fears wrote  they responded only to the most lurid  the most vivid  the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture  cannibals. But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears more like a scientist  with more coolness of judgment  they would have listened instead to the less violent but the more likely tale  the story of starvation  and headed for Tahiti  just as Melville's sad commentary suggests. And maybe if we all tried to read our fears  we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them. Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes  and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face  the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries  the gradual changes in our climate. Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest  so too might our subtlest fears be the truest. Read in the right way  our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination  a kind of everyday clairvoyance  a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out. Properly read  our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature  a little wisdom  a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing    the truth. Thank you.  Applause  So I'd like to start by focusing on the world's most dangerous animal. Now  when you talk about dangerous animals  most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks. But of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito. The mosquito has killed more humans than any other creature in human history. In fact  probably adding them all together  the mosquito has killed more humans. And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague. And you would think  would you not  that with all our science  with all our advances in society  with better towns  better civilizations  better sanitation  wealth  that we would get better at controlling mosquitos  and hence reduce this disease. And that's not really the case. If it was the case  we wouldn't have between     and     million cases of malaria every year  and we wouldn't have a million and a half deaths from malaria  and we wouldn't have a disease that was relatively unknown    years ago now suddenly turned into the largest mosquito borne virus threat that we have  and that's called dengue fever. So    years ago  pretty much no one had heard of it  no one certainly in the European environment. But dengue fever now  according to the World Health Organization  infects between    and     million people every year  so that's equivalent to the whole of the population of the U.K. being infected every year. Other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections. And dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally. In the last    years  the incidence of dengue has grown thirtyfold. Now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is  for those who don't know. Now let's assume you go on holiday. Let's assume you go to the Caribbean  or you might go to Mexico. You might go to Latin America  Asia  Africa  anywhere in Saudi Arabia. You might go to India  the Far East. It doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito  and it's the same disease. You're at risk. And let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito that's carrying that virus. Well  you could develop flu like symptoms. They could be quite mild. You could develop nausea  headache  your muscles could feel like they're contracting  and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking. And that's the nickname given to this disease. It's called breakbone fever  because that's how you can feel. Now the odd thing is  is that once you've been bitten by this mosquito  and you've had this disease  your body develops antibodies  so if you're bitten again with that strain  it doesn't affect you. But it's not one virus  it's four  and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three. So the next time you get dengue fever  if it's a different strain  you're more susceptible  you're likely to get worse symptoms  and you're more likely to get the more severe forms  hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. So you don't want dengue once  and you certainly don't want it again. So why is it spreading so fast  And the answer is this thing. This is Aedes aegypti. Now this is a mosquito that came  like its name suggests  out of North Africa  and it's spread round the world. Now  in fact  a single mosquito will only travel about     yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far. What they're very good at doing is hitchhiking  particularly the eggs. They will lay their eggs in clear water  any pool  any puddle  any birdbath  any flower pot  anywhere there's clear water  they'll lay their eggs  and if that clear water is near freight  it's near a port  if it's anywhere near transport  those eggs will then get transported around the world. And that's what's happened. Mankind has transported these eggs all the way around the world  and these insects have infested over     countries  and there's now  .  billion people living in countries where this mosquito resides. To give you just a couple of examples how fast this has happened  in the mid '  s  Brazil declared   We have no Aedes aegypti   and currently they spend about a billion dollars now a year trying to get rid of it  trying to control it  just one species of mosquito. Two days ago  or yesterday  I can't remember which  I saw a Reuters report that said Madeira had had their first cases of dengue  about    cases  with about     probable cases. That's two days ago. Interestingly  Madeira first got the insect in       and here we are  a few years later  first cases of dengue. So the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes  dengue will follow. Once you've got the mosquito in your area  anyone coming into that area with dengue  mosquito will bite them  mosquito will bite somewhere else  somewhere else  somewhere else  and you'll get an epidemic. So we must be good at killing mosquitos. I mean  that can't be very difficult. Well  there's two principle ways. The first way is that you use larvicides. You use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed. Now in an urban environment  that's extraordinarily difficult. You've got to get your chemical into every puddle  every birdbath  every tree trunk. It's just not practical. The second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around. This is a picture of fogging. Here what someone is doing is mixing up chemical in a smoke and basically spreading that through the environment. You could do the same with a space spray. This is really unpleasant stuff  and if it was any good  we wouldn't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever. So it's not very effective  but it's probably the best thing we've got at the moment. Having said that  actually  your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long sleeve shirt and a little bit of DEET to go with it. So let's start again. Let's design a product  right from the word go  and decide what we want. Well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population. There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there. We want something that gets that population right the way down so it can't get the disease transmission. Clearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans. We are going to use it in and around humans. It has to be safe. We don't want to have a lasting impact on the environment. We don't want to do anything that you can't undo. Maybe a better product comes along in        years. Fine. We don't want a lasting environmental impact. We want something that's relatively cheap  or cost effective  because there's an awful lot of countries involved  and some of them are emerging markets  some of them emerging countries  low income. And finally  you want something that's species specific. You want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue  but you don't really want to get all the other insects. Some are quite beneficial. Some are important to your ecosystem. This one's not. It's invaded you. But you don't want to get all of the insects. You just want to get this one. And most of the time  you'll find this insect lives in and around your home  so this    whatever we do has got to get to that insect. It's got to get into people's houses  into the bedrooms  into the kitchens. Now there are two features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project  and that is  firstly  males don't bite. It's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you. The male can't bite you  won't bite you  doesn't have the mouth parts to bite you. It's just the female. And the second is a phenomenon that males are very  very good at finding females. If there's a male mosquito that you release  and if there's a female around  that male will find the female. So basically  we've used those two factors. So here's a typical situation  male meets female  lots of offspring. A single female will lay about up to     eggs at a time  up to about     in her lifetime. Now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the death of the offspring  then the offspring don't survive  and instead of having     mosquitos running around  you have none. And if you can put more  I'll call them sterile  that the offspring will actually die at different stages  but I'll call them sterile for now. If you put more sterile males out into the environment  then the females are more likely to find a sterile male than a fertile one  and you will bring that population down. So the males will go out  they'll look for females  they'll mate. If they mate successfully  then no offspring. If they don't find a female  then they'll die anyway. They only live a few days. And that's exactly where we are. So this is technology that was developed in Oxford University a few years ago. The company itself  Oxitec  we've been working for the last    years  very much on a sort of similar development pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company. So about    years of internal evaluation  testing  to get this to a state where we think it's actually ready. And then we've gone out into the big outdoors  always with local community consent  always with the necessary permits. So we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands  a small one in Malaysia  and two more now in Brazil. And what's the result  Well  the result has been very good. In about four months of release  we've brought that population of mosquitos   in most cases we're dealing with villages here of about              people  that sort of size  starting small   we've taken that mosquito population down by about    percent in about four months. And in fact  the numbers after that get  those get very difficult to count  because there just aren't any left. So that's been what we've seen in Cayman  it's been what we've seen in Brazil in those trials. And now what we're doing is we're going through a process to scale up to a town of about         so we can see this work at big scale. And we've got a production unit in Oxford  or just south of Oxford  where we actually produce these mosquitos. We can produce them  in a space a bit more than this red carpet  I can produce about    million a week. We can transport them around the world. It's not very expensive  because it's a coffee cup    something the size of a coffee cup will hold about three million eggs. So freight costs aren't our biggest problem.  Laughter  So we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory. And for Brazil  where we've been doing some trials  the Brazilian government themselves have now built their own mosquito factory  far bigger than ours  and we'll use that for scaling up in Brazil. There you are. We've sent mosquito eggs. We've separated the males from the females. The males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go. It's actually a little bit more precise than that. You want to release them so that you get good coverage of your area. So you take a Google Map  you divide it up  work out how far they can fly  and make sure you're releasing such that you get coverage of the area  and then you go back  and within a very short space of time  you're bringing that population right the way down. We've also done this in agriculture. We've got several different species of agriculture coming along  and I'm hoping that soon we'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back and start looking at malaria. So that's where we stand at the moment  and I've just got a few final thoughts  which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area  and these biological approaches are coming in in very different forms  and when you think about genetic engineering  we've now got enzymes for industrial processing  enzymes  genetically engineered enzymes in food. We have G.M. crops  we have pharmaceuticals  we have new vaccines  all using roughly the same technology  but with very different outcomes. And I'm in favor  actually. Of course I am. I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies don't work well or have become unacceptable. And although the techniques are similar  the outcomes are very  very different  and if you take our approach  for example  and you compare it to  say  G.M. crops  both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit. Both have a side benefit  which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously. But whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant  for example  and give it an advantage  what we're actually doing is taking the mosquito and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have  rendering it unable to reproduce effectively. So for the mosquito  it's a dead end. Thank you very much.  Applause  We live in an incredibly busy world. The pace of life is often frantic  our minds are always busy  and we're always doing something. So with that in mind  I'd like you just to take a moment to think  when did you last take any time to do nothing  Just    minutes  undisturbed  And when I say nothing  I do mean nothing. So that's no emailing  texting  no Internet  no TV  no chatting  no eating  no reading. Not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future. Simply doing nothing. I see a lot of very blank faces. You probably have to go a long way back. And this is an extraordinary thing  right  We're talking about our mind. The mind  our most valuable and precious resource  through which we experience every single moment of our life. The mind that we rely upon to be happy  content  emotionally stable as individuals  and at the same time  to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others. This is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused  creative  spontaneous  and to perform at our very best in everything that we do. And yet  we don't take any time out to look after it. In fact  we spend more time looking after our cars  our clothes and our hair than we    okay  maybe not our hair  but you see where I'm going. The result  of course  is that we get stressed. You know  the mind whizzes away like a washing machine going round and round  lots of difficult  confusing emotions  and we don't really know how to deal with that. And the sad fact is that we are so distracted that we're no longer present in the world in which we live. We miss out on the things that are most important to us  and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes  that's the way life is  so we've just kind of got to get on with it. That's really not how it has to be. So I was about    when I went along to my first meditation class. And trust me  it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine  the sitting cross legged on the floor  the incense  the herbal tea  the vegetarians  the whole deal  but my mom was going and I was intrigued  so I went along with her. I'd also seen a few kung fu movies  and secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly  but I was very young at the time. Now as I was there  I guess  like a lot of people  I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind. You get stressed  you do some meditation. I hadn't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature  until I was about     when a number of things happened in my life in quite quick succession  really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts  inundated with difficult emotions that I didn't know how to cope with. Every time I sort of pushed one down  another one would pop back up again. It was a really very stressful time. I guess we all deal with stress in different ways. Some people will bury themselves in work  grateful for the distraction. Others will turn to their friends  their family  looking for support. Some people hit the bottle  start taking medication. My own way of dealing with it was to become a monk. So I quit my degree  I headed off to the Himalayas  I became a monk  and I started studying meditation. People often ask me what I learned from that time. Well  obviously it changed things. Let's face it  becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things. But it was more than that. It taught me    it gave me a greater appreciation  an understanding for the present moment. By that I mean not being lost in thought  not being distracted  not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions  but instead learning how to be in the here and now  how to be mindful  how to be present. I think the present moment is so underrated. It sounds so ordinary  and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it's anything but ordinary. There was a research paper that came out of Harvard  just recently  that said on average  our minds are lost in thought almost    percent of the time.    percent. At the same time  this sort of constant mind wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness. Now we're not here for that long anyway  but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy  I don't know  it just kind of seems tragic  actually  especially when there's something we can do about it  when there's a positive  practical  achievable  scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy  to be more mindful and less distracted. And the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about    minutes a day  it impacts our entire life. But we need to know how to do it. We need an exercise. We need a framework to learn how to be more mindful. That's essentially what meditation is. It's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment. But we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it. And that's what these are for  in case you've been wondering  because most people assume that meditation is all about stopping thoughts  getting rid of emotions  somehow controlling the mind  but actually it's quite different from that. It's more about stepping back  sort of seeing the thought clearly  witnessing it coming and going  emotions coming and going without judgment  but with a relaxed  focused mind. So for example  right now  if I focus too much on the balls  then there's no way I can relax and talk to you at the same time. Equally  if I relax too much talking to you  there's no way I can focus on the balls. I'm going to drop them. Now in life  and in meditation  there'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense  and life starts to feel a bit like this. It's a very uncomfortable way to live life  when you get this tight and stressed. At other times  we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much  and things just become a sort of little bit like this. Of course in meditation    we're going to end up falling asleep. So we're looking for a balance  a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement. Now  what usually happens when we're learning to be mindful is that we get distracted by a thought. Let's say this is an anxious thought. Everything's going fine  and we see the anxious thought.  Oh  I didn't realize I was worried about that.  You go back to it  repeat it.  Oh  I am worried. I really am worried. Wow  there's so much anxiety.  And before we know it  right  we're anxious about feeling anxious. You know  this is crazy. We do this all the time  even on an everyday level. If you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth. You know it's wobbly  and you know that it hurts. But what do you do every        seconds  It does hurt. And we reinforce the storyline  right  And we just keep telling ourselves  and we do it all the time. And it's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind. But when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way  you might see many different patterns. You might find a mind that's really restless and    the whole time. Don't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that. You might find a mind that's very dull and boring  and it's just  almost mechanical  it just seems it's as if you're getting up  going to work  eat  sleep  get up  work. Or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round your mind. Well  whatever it is  meditation offers the opportunity  the potential to step back and to get a different perspective  to see that things aren't always as they appear. We can't change every little thing that happens to us in life  but we can change the way that we experience it. That's the potential of meditation  of mindfulness. You don't have to burn any incense  and you definitely don't have to sit on the floor. All you need to do is to take    minutes out a day to step back  to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus  calm and clarity in your life. Thank you very much. The filmmaker Georges M li s was first a magician. Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic. With complete control of everything the audience can see  moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their deceptions. Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life  produced by the sequential projection of still frames  and they astonished the Lumi re brothers' early audiences. Even today's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen  and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect. Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over     years. Giambattista della Porta  a Neapolitan scholar in the   th century  examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated. Playing with the world  and our perception of it  really is the essence of visual effects. So digging deeper into this with the Science and Technology Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery. Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions  assumption  things are as we know them  presumption  things will behave as we expect  and context in reality  our knowledge of the world as we know it  such as scale. Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession  which is  never betray the illusion. And that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection. So from the hand cranked jump cut early days of cinema to last Sunday's Oscar winner  what follows are some steps and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects. I hope you will enjoy.

'It is today possible to realize the most impossible and improbable things.'   Georges M li s   Don Levy  Thank you. So if you've been following the news  you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the United States  all scheduled to strike within the next    years. Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal. That actually wouldn't be such a problem  because if we were really all going to die  we would put aside our differences  we'd spend whatever it took  and we'd find a way to deflect them. I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way  but they're wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us  and therefore paralyzes us. Last March  I went to the TED conference  and I saw Jim Hansen speak  the NASA scientist who first raised the alarm about global warming in the     s  and it seems that the predictions he made back then are coming true. This is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises  and if we keep on going the way we're going  we get a four  or five degree Centigrade temperature rise by the end of this century. Hansen says we can expect about a five meter rise in sea levels. This is what a five meter rise in sea levels would look like. Low lying cities all around the world will disappear within the lifetime of children born today. Hansen closed his talk by saying   Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth. That is the equivalent of what we face now. Yet we dither  taking no action to deflect the asteroid  even though the longer we wait  the more difficult and expensive it becomes.  Of course  the left wants to take action  but the right denies that there's any problem. All right  so I go back from TED  and then the following week  I'm invited to a dinner party in Washington  D.C.  where I know that I'll be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals  including Yuval Levin  and to prepare for the meeting  I read this article by Levin in National Affairs called  Beyond the Welfare State.  Levin writes that all over the world  nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable  dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era. All right  now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid  but look at these graphs that Levin showed. This graph shows the national debt as a percentage of America's GDP  and as you see  if you go all the way back to the founding  we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War. Wars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off  pay it off  pay it off  and then  oh  what's this  The Civil War. Even more expensive. Borrow a lot of money  pay it off  pay it off  pay it off  get down to near zero  and bang     World War I. Once again  the same process repeats. Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II. We rise to an astronomical level  around     percent of GDP  really unsustainable  really dangerous. But we pay it off  pay it off  pay it off  and then  what's this  Why has it been rising since the '  s  It's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded  but it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending  especially Medicare. We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II  and the baby boomers haven't even retired yet  and when they do  this is what will happen. This is data from the Congressional Budget Office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended. All right  now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical  not in terms of the x  and y axes  or in terms of the data they present  but in terms of their moral and political implications  they say the same thing. Let me translate for you.  We are doomed unless we start acting now. What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party  Can't you see reality  If you won't help  then get the hell out of the way.  We can deflect both of these asteroids. These problems are both technically solvable. Our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper partisan times  the mere fact that one side says   Look  there's an asteroid   means that the other side's going to say   Huh  What  No  I'm not even going to look up. No.  To understand why this is happening to us  and what we can do about it  we need to learn more about moral psychology. So I'm a social psychologist  and I study morality  and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds. It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality. Think of it like this. Large scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet. There are only a few species that can do it. That's a beehive. That's a termite mound  a giant termite mound. And when you find this in other animals  it's always the same story. They're always all siblings who are children of a single queen  so they're all in the same boat. They rise or fall  they live or die  as one. There's only one species on the planet that can do this without kinship  and that  of course  is us. This is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon  and this is Tenochtitlan. Now how did we do this  How did we go from being hunter gatherers        years ago to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years  It's miraculous  and part of the explanation is this ability to circle around sacred values. As you see  temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations. This is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca. It's a sacred rock  and when people circle something together  they unite  they can trust each other  they become one. It's as though you're moving an electrical wire through a magnetic field that generates current. When people circle together  they generate a current. We love to circle around things. We circle around flags  and then we can trust each other. We can fight as a team  as a unit. But even as morality binds people together into a unit  into a team  the circling blinds them. It causes them to distort reality. We begin separating everything into good versus evil. Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying. But it is a gross distortion of reality. You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress. This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in Congress falls strictly along the left right axis  so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is  you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues. And what you can see is that  in the decades after the Civil War  Congress was extraordinarily polarized  as you would expect  about as high as can be. But then  after World War I  things dropped  and we get this historically low level of polarization. This was a golden age of bipartisanship  at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together and solve grand national problems. But in the     s and '  s  the electromagnet turns back on. Polarization rises. It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in Congress. They could rearrange themselves  form bipartisan committees  but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up  the force field increased  Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart. It became much harder for them to socialize  much harder for them to cooperate. Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare. Did anybody notice that in two of the three debates  Obama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie  Do you know why they do this  It's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for.  Laughter  The polarization is strongest among our political elites. Nobody doubts that this is happening in Washington. But for a while  there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people. Well  in the last    years it's become much more apparent that it is. So look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey. And what they do on that survey is they ask what's called a feeling thermometer rating. So  how warm or cold do you feel about  you know  Native Americans  or the military  the Republican Party  the Democratic Party  all sorts of groups in American life. The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel about Democrats  and they like them. You know  ratings in the   s on a     point scale. Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise. But when you look at cross party ratings  you find  well  that it's lower  but actually  when I first saw this data  I was surprised. That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations  they were rating the other party       . It's not terrible. It drifts downwards very slightly  but now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama. It plummets. Something is going on here. The moral electromagnet is turning back on  and nowadays  just very recently  Democrats really dislike Republicans. Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing. It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too. It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart  pulling left and right into their own territories like the Bloods and the Crips. Now  there are many reasons why this is happening to us  and many of them we cannot reverse. We will never again have a political class that was forged by the experience of fighting together in World War II against a common enemy. We will never again have just three television networks  all of which are relatively centrist. And we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats and liberal northern Republicans making it easy  making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation. So for a lot of reasons  those decades after the Second World War were an historically anomalous time. We will never get back to those low levels of polarization  I believe. But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better  because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly to things that Congress did to itself in the     s that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution. These changes are detailed in many books. These are two that I strongly recommend  and they list a whole bunch of reforms. I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here. So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional  hyper polarized institution  well  the first step is  do what you can so that fewer hyper partisans get elected in the first place  and when you have closed party primaries  and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting  you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper partisans. So open primaries would make that problem much  much less severe. But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress. From my experience  and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders  most of the people going to Congress are good  hard working  intelligent people who really want to solve problems  but once they get there  they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper partisanship and that punishes independent thinking. You step out of line  you get punished. So there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this. For example  this  Citizens United  ruling is a disaster  because it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head  and if you step out of line  if you try to reach across the aisle  there's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising. But the third class of reforms is that we've got to change the nature of social relationships in Congress. The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted  friendly  very socially skillful people  and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships  make deals  you've got to cajole  please  flatter  you've got to use your personal skills  and that's the way politics has always worked. But beginning in the     s  first the House of Representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week. Nowadays  Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning  they do battle for two days  then they fly home Thursday afternoon. They don't move their families to the District. They don't meet each other's spouses or children. There's no more relationship there. And trying to run Congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil. Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up and descends into paralysis and polarization  A simple change to the legislative calendar  such as having business stretch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home  that would change the fundamental relationships in Congress. So there's a lot we can do  but who's going to push them to do it  There are a number of groups that are working on this. No Labels and Common Cause  I think  have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective. But I'd like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick  and the trick is this. Nothing pulls people together like a common threat or a common attack  especially an attack from a foreign enemy  unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology  in which case  as I said before  it can actually pull us apart. Sometimes a single threat can polarize us  as we saw. But what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this  where there's just so much stuff coming in  it's just   Start shooting  come on  everybody  we've got to just work together  just start shooting.  Because actually  we do face this situation. This is where we are as a country. So here's another asteroid. We've all seen versions of this graph  right  which shows the changes in wealth since       and as you can see  almost all the gains in wealth have gone to the top    percent  and especially the top one percent. Rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy. Especially  it destroys our ability to trust each other  to feel that we're all in the same boat  because it's obvious we're not. Some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts. Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood. We're not all in the same boat  and that means nobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good. The left has been screaming about this asteroid for    years now  and the right says   Huh  what  Hmm  No problem. No problem.  Now  why is that happening to us  Why is the inequality rising  Well  one of the largest causes  after globalization  is actually this fourth asteroid  rising non marital births. This graph shows the steady rise of out of wedlock births since the     s. Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers. Whites are headed that way too. Within a decade or two  most American children will be born into homes with no father. This means that there's much less money coming into the house. But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos. As I know from working with street children in Brazil  Mom's boyfriend is often a really  really dangerous person for kids. Now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the     s  and the left has been saying   It's not a problem. It's not a problem.  The left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children. Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here. I'm actually more critical of the men who won't take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to earn enough money to support those children. But even if you blame nobody  it still is a national problem  and one side has been more concerned about it than the other. The New York Times finally noticed this asteroid with a front page story last July showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality. We are becoming a nation of just two classes. When Americans go to college and marry each other  they have very low divorce rates. They earn a lot of money  they invest that money in their kids  some of them become tiger mothers  the kids rise to their full potential  and the kids go on to become the top two lines in this graph. And then there's everybody else  the children who don't benefit from a stable marriage  who don't have as much invested in them  who don't grow up in a stable environment  and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph. So once again  we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing. As before  we've got a problem  we've got to start working on this  we've got to do something  and what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat  But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders  we'd see that these two problems actually are best addressed together. Because if you really care about income inequality  you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups that are working on ways to promote marriage. But then you're going to run smack into the problem that women don't generally want to marry someone who doesn't have a job. So if you really care about strengthening families  you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality  who are working on raising the minimum wage  who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives. So to conclude  there are at least four asteroids headed our way. How many of you can see all four  Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit that all four of these are national problems. Please raise your hands. Okay  almost all of you. Well  congratulations  you guys are the inaugural members of the Asteroids Club  which is a club for all Americans who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point. In the Asteroids Club  we don't start by looking for common ground. Common ground is often very hard to find. No  we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground. Now  am I being naive  Is it naive to think that people could ever lay down their swords  and left and right could actually work together  I don't think so  because it happens  not all that often  but there are a variety of examples that point the way. This is something we can do. Because Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility  and they've formed dozens of organizations  at the national level  such as this one  down to many local organizations  such as To The Village Square in Tallahassee  Florida  which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate that sort of working together human relationship that's necessary to solve Florida's problems. Americans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS  and on so many humanitarian issues  liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies  and at times they really have worked together to solve these problems. And most surprisingly to me  they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice. For example  the incarceration rate  the prison population in this country has quadrupled since     . Now this is a social disaster  and liberals are very concerned about this. The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting the prison industrial complex  fighting to prevent a system that's just sucking in more and more poor young men. But are conservatives happy about this  Well  Grover Norquist isn't  because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money. And so  because the prison industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls  groups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives have come together to form a group called Right on Crime. And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane. So this is possible. We can do it. Let us therefore go to battle stations  not to fight each other  but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids. And let our first mission be to press Congress to reform itself  before it's too late for our nation. Thank you.  Applause  It's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey  to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me. I started using a wheelchair    years ago when an extended illness changed the way I could access the world. When I started using the wheelchair  it was a tremendous new freedom. I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted. It was like having an enormous new toy. I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again. Just being out on the street was exhilarating. But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom  people's reaction completely changed towards me. It was as if they couldn't see me anymore  as if an invisibility cloak had descended. They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair. When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair  they used words like  limitation    fear    pity  and  restriction.  I realized I'd internalized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level. A part of me had become alienated from myself. I was seeing myself not from my perspective  but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people's responses to me. As a result  I knew I needed to make my own stories about this experience  new narratives to reclaim my identity.   Finding Freedom  'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.'   Davis       TEDx Women   I started making work that aimed to communicate something of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair    a power chair    to negotiate the world. I was working to transform these internalized responses  to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when I started using a wheelchair  by creating unexpected images. The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with. When I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom  it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people. It seemed to open up new perspectives  and therein lay the paradigm shift. It showed that an arts practice can remake one's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar. So when I began to dive  in       I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does  but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure  completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair. So I thought   I wonder what'll happen if I put the two together    Laughter   Applause  And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years. So to give you an idea of what that's like  I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle  and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on. It is the most amazing experience  beyond most other things I've experienced in life. I literally have the freedom to move in     degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom. And the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too. Their eyes literally light up  and they say things like   I want one of those   or   If you can do that  I can do anything.  And I'm thinking  it's because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for  or so transcends the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair  they have to think in a completely new way. And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people's lives. For me  this means that they're seeing the value of difference  the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation  we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives. For me  the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation. In fact  I now call the underwater wheelchair  Portal   because it's literally pushed me through into a new way of being  into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness. And the other thing is  that because nobody's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before  and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing  being and knowing  now you have this concept in your mind. You're all part of the artwork too. Hello. My name is Jarrett Krosoczka  and I write and illustrate books for children for a living. So I use my imagination as my full time job. But well before my imagination was my vocation  my imagination saved my life. When I was a kid  I loved to draw  and the most talented artist I knew was my mother  but my mother was addicted to heroin. And when your parent is a drug addict  it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football  because as much as you want to love on that person  as much as you want to receive love from that person  every time you open your heart  you end up on your back. So throughout my childhood  my mother was incarcerated and I didn't have my father because I didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade. But I had my grandparents  my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley  who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own  after they had already raised five children. So two people who grew up in the Great Depression  there in the very  very early '  s took on a new kid. I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom of the Krosoczka family  the new kid who came out of nowhere. And I would like to say that life was totally easy with them. They each smoked two packs a day  each  nonfiltered  and by the time I was six  I could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan  dry with a twist  rocks on the side  the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink. But they loved the hell out of me. They loved me so much. And they supported my creative efforts  because my grandfather was a self made man. He ran and worked in a factory. My grandmother was a homemaker. But here was this kid who loved Transformers and Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles  and the characters that I read about  I fell in love with  and they became my friends. So my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books. I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester  Massachusetts  and I had wonderful teachers there  most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch. And I just  I can just remember the love that she offered us as her students. When I was in the third grade  a monumental event happened. An author visited our school  Jack Gantos. A published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living. And afterwards  we all went back to our classrooms and we drew our own renditions of his main character  Rotten Ralph. And suddenly the author appeared in our doorway  and I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles  going from kid to kid looking at the desks  not saying a word. But he stopped next to my desk  and he tapped on my desk  and he said   Nice cat.   Laughter  And he wandered away. Two words that made a colossal difference in my life. When I was in the third grade  I wrote a book for the first time   The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer.   Laughter  We had to write our own Greek myth  our own creation story  so I wrote a story about an owl who challenged Hermes to a flying race  and the owl cheated  and Hermes  being a Greek god  grew angry and bitter  and turned the owl into a moon  so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon while he watched his family and friends play at night. Yeah.  Laughter  My book had a title page. I was clearly worried about my intellectual property when I was eight. And it was a story that was told with words and pictures  exactly what I do now for a living  and I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own  and sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own to tell the story. My favorite page is the  About the author  page. So I learned to write about myself in third person at a young age. So I love that last sentence   He liked making this book.  And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination  and that's what writing is. Writing is using your imagination on paper  and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids  that writing would be using your imagination on paper  if they're allowed to even write now within the school hours. So I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school  and I would take out pieces of paper  and I would staple them together  and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because I loved using my imagination. And so these characters would become my friends. There was an egg  a tomato  a head of lettuce and a pumpkin  and they all lived in this refrigerator city  and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender who tried to chop them up  an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple  and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of butter.  Laughter  And I'd make my own comics too  and this was another way for me to tell stories  through words and through pictures. Now when I was in sixth grade  the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the Worcester public school system. I went from having art once a week to twice a month to once a month to not at all. And my grandfather  he was a wise man  and he saw that as a problem  because he knew that was  like  the one thing I had. I didn't play sports. I had art. So he walked into my room one evening  and he sat on the edge of my bed  and he said   Jarrett  it's up to you  but if you'd like to  we'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum.  And I was so thrilled. So from sixth through   th grade  once  twice  sometimes three times a week  I would take classes at the art museum  and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw  other kids who shared a similar passion. Now my publishing career began when I designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook  and if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in  I was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice at the time.  Laughter  And to this day  I still can do karaoke to  Ice  Ice Baby  without looking at the screen. Don't tempt me  because I will do it. So I get shipped off to private school  K through eight  public schools  but for some reason my grandfather was upset that somebody at the local high school had been stabbed and killed  so he didn't want me to go there. He wanted me to go to a private school  and he gave me an option. You can go to Holy Name  which is coed  or St. John's  which is all boys. Very wise man  because he knew I would  I felt like I was making the decision on my own  and he knew I wouldn't choose St. John's  so I went to Holy Name High School  which was a tough transition because  like I said  I didn't play sports  and it was very focused on sports  but I took solace in Mr. Shilale's art room. And I just flourished here. I just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day. So how did I make friends  I drew funny pictures of my teachers     Laughter     and I passed them around. Well  in English class  in ninth grade  my friend John  who was sitting next to me  laughed a little bit too hard. Mr. Greenwood was not pleased. He instantly saw that I was the cause of the commotion  and for the first time in my life  I was sent to the hall  and I thought   Oh no  I'm doomed. My grandfather's just going to kill me.  And he came out to the hallway and he said   Let me see the paper.  And I thought   Oh no. He thinks it's a note.  And so I took this picture  and I handed it to him. And we sat in silence for that brief moment  and he said to me   You're really talented.   Laughter   You're really good. You know  the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist  and you should be the cartoonist. Just stop drawing in my class.  So my parents never found out about it. I didn't get in trouble. I was introduced to Mrs. Casey  who ran the school newspaper  and I was for three and a half years the cartoonist for my school paper  handling such heavy issues as  seniors are mean  freshmen are nerds  the prom bill is so expensive. I can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom. And I took the headmaster to task and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley who was unlucky in love  and I just swore up and down that this wasn't about me  but all these years later it was totally me. But it was so cool because I could write these stories  I could come up with these ideas  and they'd be published in the school paper  and people who I didn't know could read them. And I loved that thought  of being able to share my ideas through the printed page. On my   th birthday  my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever  a drafting table that I have worked on ever since. Here I am     years later  and I still work on this table every day. On the evening of my   th birthday  I was given this table  and we had Chinese food. And this was my fortune   You will be successful in your work.  I taped it to the top left hand of my table  and as you can see  it's still there. Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything. Well  two things  Rusty  who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade. And a video camera. I just wanted a video camera. And after begging and pleading for Christmas  I got a second hand video camera  and I instantly started making my own animations on my own  and all throughout high school I made my own animations. I convinced my   th grade English teacher to allow me to do my book report on Stephen King's  Misery  as an animated short.  Laughter  And I kept making comics. I kept making comics  and at the Worcester Art Museum  I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given. Mark Lynch  he's an amazing teacher and he's still a dear friend of mine  and I was    or     and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course  and I was so excited  I was beaming. I had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way  and it taught me how to draw superheroes  how to draw a woman  how to draw muscles just the way they were supposed to be if I were to ever draw for X Men or Spiderman. And all the color just drained from his face  and he looked at me  and he said   Forget everything you learned.  And I didn't understand. He said   You have a great style. Celebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw. Draw the way you're drawing and keep at it  because you're really good.  Now when I was a teenager  I was angsty as any teenager was  but after    years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a yo yo and a father who was faceless  I was angry. And when I was     I met my father for the first time  upon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about. And on the day I met my father for the first time  I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design  my one and only choice for college. But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids  kids with leukemia  and this kid Eric changed my life. Eric didn't live to see his sixth birthday  and Eric lives with me every day. So after this experience  my art teacher  Mr. Shilale  he brought in these picture books  and I thought   Picture books for kids   and I started writing books for young readers when I was a senior in high school. Well  I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design. I transferred to RISD as a sophomore  and it was there that I took every course that I could on writing  and it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug who wanted to be friends with this kid. The kid had no patience for him. And I sent this book out to a dozen publishers and it was rejected every single time  but I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp  an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses  and it's those kids at the camp that read my stories  and I read to them  and I saw that they responded to my work. I graduated from RISD. My grandparents were very proud  and I moved to Boston  and I set up shop. I set up a studio and I tried to get published. I would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards to editors and art directors  but they would go unanswered. And my grandfather would call me every week  and he would say   Jarrett  how's it going  Do you have a job yet   Because he had just invested a significant amount of money in my college education. And I said   Yes  I have a job. I write and illustrate children's books.  And he said   Well  who pays you for that   And I said   No one  no one  no one just yet. But I know it's going to happen.  Now  I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off season programming to make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground  and this kid who was just this really hyper kid  I started calling him  Monkey Boy   and I went home and wrote a book called  Good Night  Monkey Boy.  And I sent out one last batch of postcards. And I received an email from an editor at Random House with a subject line   Nice work   Exclamation point.  Dear Jarrett  I received your postcard. I liked your art  so I went to your website and I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories  because I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them. Please let me know if you're ever in New York City.  And this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books. So the next week I  happened  to be in New York. And I met with this editor  and I left New York for a contract for my first book   Good Night  Monkey Boy   which was published on June         . And my local paper celebrated the news. The local bookstore made a big deal of it. They sold out of all of their books. My friend described it as a wake  but happy  because everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me  but I wasn't dead. I was just signing books. My grandparents  they were in the middle of it. They were so happy. They couldn't have been more proud. Mrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there. Mrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said   I taught him how to read.   Laughter  And then something happened that changed my life. I got my first piece of significant fan mail  where this kid loved Monkey Boy so much that he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake. For a two year old  that is like a tattoo.  Laughter  You know  You only get one birthday per year. And for him  it's only his second. And I got this picture  and I thought   This picture is going to live within his consciousness for his entire life. He will forever have this photo in his family photo albums.  So that photo  since that moment  is framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books. I have    picture books out.  Punk Farm    Baghead    Ollie the Purple Elephant.  I just finished the ninth book in the  Lunch Lady  series  which is a graphic novel series about a lunch lady who fights crime. I'm expecting the release of a chapter book called  Platypus Police Squad  The Frog Who Croaked.  And I travel the country visiting countless schools  letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats. And I meet Bagheads. Lunch ladies treat me really well. And I got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights. Twice now  the  Lunch Lady  series has won the Children's Choice Book of the Year in the third or fourth grade category  and those winners were displayed on a jumbotron screen in Times Square.  Punk Farm  and  Lunch Lady  are in development to be movies  so I am a movie producer and I really do think  thanks to that video camera I was given in ninth grade. I've seen people have  Punk Farm  birthday parties  people have dressed up as  Punk Farm  for Halloween  a  Punk Farm  baby room  which makes me a little nervous for the child's well being in the long term. And I get the most amazing fan mail  and I get the most amazing projects  and the biggest moment for me came last Halloween. The doorbell rang and it was a trick or treater dressed as my character. It was so cool. Now my grandparents are no longer living  so to honor them  I started a scholarship at the Worcester Art Museum for kids who are in difficult situations but whose caretakers can't afford the classes. And it displayed the work from my first    years of publishing  and you know who was there to celebrate  Mrs. Alisch. I said   Mrs. Alisch  how are you   And she responded with   I'm here.   Laughter  That's true. You are alive  and that's pretty good right now. So the biggest moment for me  though  my most important job now is I am a dad myself  and I have two beautiful daughters  and my goal is to surround them by inspiration  by the books that are in every single room of our house to the murals I painted in their rooms to the moments for creativity where you find  in quiet times  by making faces on the patio to letting her sit in the very desk that I've sat in for the past    years. Thank you.  Applause  I'd like to share with you the story of one of my patients called Celine. Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of Cameroon in west Central Africa. Six years ago  at the time of her HIV diagnosis  she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time. When I first met Celine  a little over a year ago  she had gone for    months without any antiretroviral therapy  and she was very ill. She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the    kilometer distance. Now during the clinical trial  she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge  and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds. All of these ended once the trial was completed  leaving Celine with no alternatives. She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she'd received during the trial  or even what the trial had been about. I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue. Yet what puzzled me most was Celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial  yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed. Now  I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted. Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results. Maybe it even got published in a high profile scientific journal. Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients. But it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who  like Celine  were left to their own devices once the research had been completed. I do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting HIV clinical trials in developing countries is bad. On the contrary  clinical trials are extremely useful tools  and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries. However  the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation  especially in the context of externally funded research. Sadly enough  the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research. I'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries  especially those in sub Saharan Africa  so attractive for these HIV clinical trials  Well  in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results  they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new HIV infections. Sub Saharan Africa largely fits this description  with    million people living with HIV  an estimated    percent of the    million people who are infected worldwide. Also  research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty  endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems. A clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized  and in the absence of good health care systems  almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing. Even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation  less rigorous ethical reviews  and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure. As funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict  you can see why this context becomes very  very attractive. The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable. How then can we ensure that  in our search for the cure  we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic  I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done. The first of these is informed consent. Now  in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable  participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand  and must freely consent to participate in the trial. This is especially important in developing countries  where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits. Consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries. For example  it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant  like Celine  sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read  let alone understand. Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials  as well as the incentives for participation. The information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats. The second point I would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial. Now  this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy. Should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world  Or should they be given an alternative standard of care  such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted  Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed  Now  in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver  the answer is straightforward. However  the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries. It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial  and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study. That brings us to the third point I want you think about  the ethical review of research. An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial. Unfortunately  this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries. Local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries  and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors. Public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate. The final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed. I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended. Now  researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed. In addition  they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends. If  for any reason  they feel that this might not be possible  then I think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place. Now  fortunately for Celine  our meeting did not end in my office. I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program closer to her home  and with a support group to help her cope. Her story has a positive ending  but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate. Although she may not know this  my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries  and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done. I believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change. If you are a researcher  I hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience  to remain ethical in your research  and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers. If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company  I challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound. If you come from a developing country like myself  I urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country. Yes  there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV  to find an effective vaccine for malaria  to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B.  but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way. Thank you. I was sitting with my girls  and Joy said   Dang  I wish he'd get off my back. My daddy  he calls me all the time.   Lucky for you he calls at all   said Jasmine.  I haven't heard from my dad in years.  At this moment  I knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers. At Camp Diva  my non profit organization  we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of African descent prepare for their passage into womanhood. These girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms. So I asked the girls   How can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers    Let's have a dance   one girl shouted  and all the girls quickly backed her up. They started dreaming about the decorations  invitations  the dresses they were going to wear  and what their fathers could and could not wear.  Laughter  It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes  but even if I could have slowed down those girls  I wouldn't have  because one thing that I have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need. The wisdom lives inside of them. As long as they have infrastructure  mentorship and resources  they can build what they need  not only to survive  but to thrive. So we had a dance  and girls and their fathers came in multitudes. They were dressed to the nines. They acted sweet. They acted silly. They really enjoyed each other's company. It was a huge success. And the girls decided to make it an annual event. So as the seasons changed  and it was time to plan the dance again  one girl named Brianna spoke up  and she said   My dad can't come to the dance  and this whole thing is making me sad.   Why not   the girls asked.  Because he's in jail   she bravely admitted.  Well  can he just get out for a day   one of the girls asked.  Laughter   And come in shackles  That's worse than not having him here at all.  At this moment  I saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes. So I asked   What do you think we should do about this  We want every girl to experience the dance  right   So the girls thought for a moment  and one girl suggested   Why don't we just take the dance in the jail   Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that  and said   Are you crazy  Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls  dressed up      Laughter      to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits   Because that's what they called them. I said   Girls  well  well  you never know unless you ask.  So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff  signed collectively by each girl  and I would have to say  he is a very special sheriff. He contacted me immediately and said  whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside  his doors are always open. Because one thing he did know  that when fathers are connected to their children  it is less likely that they will return. So     inmates and    girls were invited. The girls were dressed in their Sunday best  and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties. They hugged. They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish. They laughed together. It was beautiful. The fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection  something that a lot of them didn't even have for a while. Fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play  and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance. Even the guards cried. But after the dance  we all realized that Dad still would be in jail. So we needed to create something that they could take with them. So we brought in Flip cams  and we had them look at the Flip cams and just interview each other    their messages  their thoughts. This was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected  they could reconnect through this image. I'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes with that camera and said   Daddy  when you look at me  what do you see   Because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve  and how they see us for the rest of our lives. I know that very well  because I was one of the lucky girls. I have had my father in my life always. He's even here today. And that is why it is extremely special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers  especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors. We have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions and given the fathers the freedom to answer. Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought  What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world  Because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter's life. It's a great time to be a molecular biologist.  Laughter  Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper. By the end of this year  we'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than       euros. Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest growing technology sector. It has the power  potentially  to replace our fossil fuels  to revolutionize medicine  and to touch every aspect of our daily lives. So who gets to do it  I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it. But what about that guy   Laughter  In       I first heard about DIYbio. It's a movement that    it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone  not just scientists and people in government labs. The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate  it could really stimulate innovation. Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea of what their needs are. And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road  all these associated social  moral  ethical questions  and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs. So wouldn't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff  do it hands on  I thought so. So  three years ago  I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace. It's a nonprofit  a community biotech lab in Brooklyn  New York  and the idea was people could come  they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open  friendly atmosphere. None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next. Can you guess  The press started calling us. And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy  the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein  and as a result  for the next six months  when you Googled my name  instead of getting my scientific papers  you got this.   Am I a biohazard    It was pretty depressing. The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world  there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were. They were opening biohacker spaces  and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did  more regulations  less resources. But now  three years later  here's where we stand. It's a vibrant  global community of hackerspaces  and this is just the beginning. These are some of the biggest ones  and there are others opening every day. There's one probably going to open up in Moscow  one in South Korea  and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of. Let me take you on a little tour. Biohackers work alone. We work in groups  in big cities    Laughter    and in small villages. We reverse engineer lab equipment. We genetically engineer bacteria. We hack hardware  software  wetware  and  of course  the code of life. We like to build things. Then we like to take things apart. We make things grow. We make things glow. And we make cells dance. The spirit of these labs  it's open  it's positive  but  you know  sometimes when people think of us  the first thing that comes to mind is bio safety  bio security  all the dark side stuff. I'm not going to minimize those concerns. Any powerful technology is inherently dual use  and  you know  you get something like synthetic biology  nanobiotechnology  it really compels you  you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups  because they have better infrastructure  they have better facilities  and they have access to pathogens. So the United Nations did just that  and they recently issued a report on this whole area  and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative  and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community  and they noted  not surprisingly  that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics. As a matter of fact  DIY people from all over the world  America  Europe  got together last year  and we hammered out a common code of ethics. That's a lot more than conventional science has done. Now  we follow state and local regulations. We dispose of our waste properly  we follow safety procedures  we don't work with pathogens. You know  if you're working with a pathogen  you're not part of the biohacker community  you're part of the bioterrorist community  I'm sorry. And sometimes people ask me   Well  what about an accident   Well  working with the safe organisms that we normally work with  the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating  like  some sort of superbug  that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Now  it could happen  but I'm not going to plan my life around it. I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk. I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project. It's a study at Harvard where  at the end of the study  they're going to take my entire genomic sequence  all of my medical information  and my identity  and they're going to post it online for everyone to see. There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion. The one I liked the best is  someone could download my sequence  go back to the lab  synthesize some fake Ellen DNA  and plant it at a crime scene.  Laughter  But like DIYbio  the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk. Now  you might be asking yourself   Well  you know  what would I do in a biolab   Well  it wasn't that long ago we were asking   Well  what would anyone do with a personal computer   So this stuff is just beginning. We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg. Let me show you what you could do right now. A biohacker in Germany  a journalist  wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street  Yep  you guessed it. He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs  analyzed the saliva  identified the dog  and confronted the dog owner. I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard. Looked like a ladybug  right  It actually is a Japanese beetle. And the same kind of technology    it's called DNA barcoding  it's really cool    You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga  if that sushi is really tuna  or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat's. In a biohacker space  you can analyze your genome for mutations. You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's  and you can explore your ancestry. You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere  collect microbes  see what's up there. You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water. You can make some sort of a biofuel cell. You can do a lot of things. You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular  and they look at social  ecological problems from a completely different perspective. It's really cool. Some people ask me  well  why am I involved  I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science. The thing is  there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else. There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project  and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money  that it's going to save mankind  or even that it's feasible. It just has to follow safety guidelines. If you had spaces like this all over the world  it could really change the perception of who's allowed to do biotech. It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing. Why not personal biotech  If everyone in this room got involved  who knows what we could do  This is such a new area  and as we say back in Brooklyn  you ain't seen nothin' yet.  Laughter  Hi. My name is Cameron Russell  and for the last little while  I've been a model. Actually  for    years. And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress. So luckily  I brought an outfit change. This is the first outfit change on the TED stage  so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it  I think. If some of the women were really horrified when I came out  you don't have to tell me now  but I'll find out later on Twitter. I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief    seconds. Not everybody gets to do that. These heels are very uncomfortable  so good thing I wasn't going to wear them. The worst part is putting this sweater over my head  because that's when you'll all laugh at me  so don't do anything while it's over my head. All right. So  why did I do that  That was awkward. Well    Hopefully not as awkward as that picture. Image is powerful  but also  image is superficial. I just totally transformed what you thought of me  in six seconds. And in this picture  I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life. I was totally uncomfortable  and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair. And of course  barring surgery  or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work  there's very little that we can do to transform how we look  and how we look  though it is superficial and immutable  has a huge impact on our lives. So today  for me  being fearless means being honest. And I am on this stage because I am a model. I am on this stage because I am a pretty  white woman  and in my industry  we call that a sexy girl. I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me  but with an honest twist. So the first question is  how do you become a model  I always just say   Oh  I was scouted   but that means nothing. The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery  and I am the recipient of a legacy  and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy. Well  for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire  but also as tall  slender figures  and femininity and white skin. And this is a legacy that was built for me  and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on. And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point  and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like   Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen.  And first  I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive. But unfortunately  I have to inform you that in       a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway  every single one that was hired  and of the     models that were hired  only     or less than four percent  were non white. The next question people always ask is   Can I be a model when I grow up   And the first answer is   I don't know  they don't put me in charge of that.  But the second answer  and what I really want to say to these little girls is   Why  You know  You can be anything. You could be the President of the United States  or the inventor of the next Internet  or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet  which would be awesome  because you'd be the first one.  If  after this amazing list  they still are like   No  no  Cameron  I want to be a model   well  then I say   Be my boss.  Because I'm not in charge of anything  and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H M  or the next Steven Meisel. Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up. It's out of your control  and it's awesome  and it's not a career path. I will demonstrate for you now    years of accumulated model knowledge  because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons  it can just be distilled right now. So  if the photographer is right there  the light is right there  like a nice HMI  and the client says   We want a walking shot   this leg goes first  nice and long  this arm goes back  this arm goes forward  the head is at three quarters  and you just go back and forth  just do that  and then you look back at your imaginary friends                times. It will look something like this. Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle. That was    I don't know what happened there. Unfortunately  after you've gone to school  and you have a r sum  and you've done a few jobs  you can't say anything anymore  so if you say you want to be the President of the United States  but your r sum  reads   Underwear Model     years   people give you a funny look. The next question is   Do they retouch all the photos   And yeah  they pretty much retouch all the photos  but that is only a small component of what's happening. This picture is the very first picture that I ever took  and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini  and I didn't even have my period yet. I know we're getting personal  but I was a young girl. This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier. Here's me on the same day as this shoot. My friend got to come. Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue. Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine. And here's me today. And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me. They are constructions  and they are constructions by a group of professionals  by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre production and post production  and they build this. That's not me. Okay  so the next question people always ask me is   Do you get free stuff   I do have too many   inch heels which I never get to wear  except for earlier  but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life  and that's what we don't like to talk about. I grew up in Cambridge  and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free. When I was a teenager  I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course  we got pulled over  and all it took was a  Sorry  officer   and we were on our way. And I got these free things because of how I look  not who I am  and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are. I live in New York  and last year  of the         teenagers that were stopped and frisked      of them were black and Latino  and most of them were young men. And there are only         young black and Latino men in New York  so for them  it's not a question of   Will I get stopped   but  How many times will I get stopped  When will I get stopped   When I was researching this talk  I found out that of the    year old girls in the United States      don't like their bodies  and that number goes to     by the time that they're   . So  the last question people ask me is   What is it like to be a model   And I think the answer that they're looking for is   If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair  you will be so happy and fabulous.  And when we're backstage  we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that. We say   It's really amazing to travel  and it's amazing to get to work with creative  inspired  passionate people.  And those things are true  but they're only one half of the story  because the thing that we never say on camera  that I have never said on camera  is   I am insecure.  And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. And if you ever are wondering   If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair  will I be happier   you just need to meet a group of models  because they have the thinnest thighs  the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes  and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet. When I was writing this talk  I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance  because on the one hand  I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say   Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor   and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with   and it doesn't always make me happy.  But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries. But I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great that I got to come before    or    or    years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career  because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job  or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college  which seems so important right now. If there's a takeaway to this talk  I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures. Thank you. So  before I became a dermatologist  I started in general medicine  as most dermatologists do in Britain. At the end of that time  I went off to Australia  about    years ago. What you learn when you go to Australia is the Australians are very competitive. And they are not magnanimous in victory. And that happened a lot   You pommies  you can't play cricket  rugby.  I could accept that. But moving into work    and we have each week what's called a journal club  when you'd sit down with the other doctors and you'd study a scientific paper in relation to medicine. And after week one  it was about cardiovascular mortality  a dry subject    how many people die of heart disease  what the rates are. And they were competitive about this   You pommies  your rates of heart disease are shocking.  And of course  they were right. Australians have about a third less heart disease than we do    less deaths from heart attacks  heart failure  less strokes    they're generally a healthier bunch. And of course they said this was because of their fine moral standing  their exercise  because they're Australians and we're weedy pommies  and so on. But it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain. Within Britain  there is a gradient of health    and this is what's called standardized mortality  basically your chances of dying. This is looking at data from the paper about    years ago  but it's true today. Comparing your rates of dying    degrees north    that's the South  that's London and places    by latitude  and    degrees    the bad news is that's here  Glasgow. I'm from Edinburgh. Worse news  that's even Edinburgh. So what accounts for this horrible space here between us up here in southern Scotland and the South  Now  we know about smoking  deep fried Mars bars  chips    the Glasgow diet. All of these things. But this graph is after taking into account all of these known risk factors. This is after accounting for smoking  social class  diet  all those other known risk factors. We are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go. Now  sunlight  of course  comes into this. And vitamin D has had a great deal of press  and a lot of people get concerned about it. And we need vitamin D. It's now a requirement that children have a certain amount. My grandmother grew up in Glasgow  back in the     s and '  s when rickets was a real problem and cod liver oil was brought in. And that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city. And I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother. I distinctly    nobody forgets cod liver oil. But an association  The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are  the less heart disease they have  the less cancer. There seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you. And it is  to prevent rickets and so on. But if you give people vitamin D supplements  you don't change that high rate of heart disease. And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great. So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town. It's not the only reason preventing heart disease. High vitamin D levels  I think  are a marker for sunlight exposure  and sunlight exposure  in methods I'm going to show  is good for heart disease. Anyway  I came back from Australia  and despite the obvious risks to my health  I moved to Aberdeen. Now  in Aberdeen  I started my dermatology training. But I also became interested in research  and in particular I became interested in this substance  nitric oxide. Now these three guys up here  Furchgott  Ignarro and Murad  won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in     . And they were the first people to describe this new chemical transmitter  nitric oxide. What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels  so it lowers your blood pressure. It also dilates the coronary arteries  so it stops angina. And what was remarkable about it was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body  we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin  or nerve transmission. Very complex processes with very complex chemicals that fit into very complex receptors. And here's this incredibly simple molecule  a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together  and yet these are hugely important for  unclear  our low blood pressure  for neurotransmission  for many  many things  but particularly cardiovascular health. And I started doing research  and we found  very excitingly  that the skin produces nitric oxide. So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises. It arises in the skin. Well  having found that and published that  I thought  well  what's it doing  How do you have low blood pressure in your skin  It's not the heart. What do you do  So I went off to the States  as many people do if they're going to do research  and I spent a few years in Pittsburgh. This is Pittsburgh. And I was interested in these really complex systems. We thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death  and how cells survive  and their resistance to other things. And I first off started work in cell culture  growing cells  and then I was using knockout mouse models    mice that couldn't make the gene. We worked out a mechanism  which    NO was helping cells survive. And I then moved back to Edinburgh. And in Edinburgh  the experimental animal we use is the medical student. It's a species close to human  with several advantages over mice  They're free  you don't shave them  they feed themselves  and nobody pickets your office saying   Save the lab medical student.  So they're really an ideal model. But what we found was that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice. It seemed we couldn't turn off the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans. We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it  we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide. And the reason for this  it turned out  after two or three years' work  was that in the skin we have huge stores not of nitric oxide  because nitric oxide is a gas  and it's released     Poof      and in a few seconds it's away  but it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide    nitrate  NO   nitrite  NO   nitrosothiols. And these are more stable  and your skin has got really large stores of NO. And we then thought to ourselves  with those big stores  I wonder if sunlight might activate those stores and release them from the skin  where the stores are about    times as big as what's in the circulation. Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation  and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system  Well  I'm an experimental dermatologist  so what we did was we thought we'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight. And so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers and we exposed them to ultraviolet light. So these are kind of sunlamps. Now  what we were careful to do was  vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story. So we used ultraviolet A  which doesn't make vitamin D. When we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about    minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh  what we produced was  we produced a rise in circulating nitric oxide. So we put patients with these subjects under the UV  and their NO levels do go up  and their blood pressure goes down. Not by much  as an individual level  but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population. And when we shone UV at them  or when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps  but didn't actually let the rays hit the skin  this didn't happen. So this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin. Now  we're still collecting data. A few good things here  This appeared to be more marked in older people. I'm not sure exactly how much. One of the subjects here was my mother in law  and clearly I do not know her age. But certainly in people older than my wife  this appears to be a more marked effect. And the other thing I should mention was there was no change in vitamin D. This is separate from vitamin D. So vitamin D is good for you    it stops rickets  it prevents calcium metabolism  important stuff. But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D. Now  one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place. If your leg is chopped off and you lose blood  your body will clamp down  increase the heart rate  do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up. That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle. So what we've next done is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation. So we've measured    this is again  notice no tail and hairless  this is a medical student. In the arm  you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it. And what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation    this is the thick line here    this is shining UV on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin. There is no change in blood flow  in dilatation of the blood vessels. But the active irradiation  during the UV and for an hour after it  there is dilation of the blood vessels. This is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure  by which you dilate the coronary arteries also  to let the blood be supplied with the heart. So here  further data that ultraviolet    that's sunlight    has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system. So we thought we'd just kind of model    Different amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year  so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide    the nitrates  nitrites  nitrosothiols in the skin    cleave to release NO. Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that. So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that. And you can look    So  if you live on the equator  the sun comes straight overhead  it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere. In winter or summer  it's the same amount of light. If you live up here  in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down  but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere  and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out  and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth are different from summer to winter. So what you can do is you can multiply those data by the NO that's released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into the circulation. Now  if you're on the equator here    that's these two lines here  the red line and the purple line    the amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve  it's the area in this space here. So if you're on the equator  December or June  you've got masses of NO being released from the skin. So Ventura is in southern California. In summer  you might as well be at the equator. It's great. Lots of NO is released. Ventura mid winter  well  there's still a decent amount. Edinburgh in summer  the area beneath the curve is pretty good  but Edinburgh in winter  the amount of NO that can be released is next to nothing  tiny amounts. So what do we think  We're still working at this story  we're still developing it  we're still expanding it. We think it's very important. We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north south health divide within Britain  It's of relevance to us. We think that the skin    well  we know that the skin has got very large stores of nitric oxide as these various other forms. We suspect a lot of these come from diet  green leafy vegetables  beetroot  lettuce has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin. We think they're then stored in the skin  and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects. And this is ongoing work  but dermatologists    I mean  I'm a dermatologist. My day job is saying to people   You've got skin cancer  it's caused by sunlight  don't go in the sun.  I actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight. Yes  sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer  but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher than deaths from skin cancer. And I think that we need to be more aware of  and we need to find the risk benefit ratio. How much sunlight is safe  and how can we finesse this best for our general health  So  thank you very much indeed. You know  my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch. I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids  and when my daughter was four  we got to watch  The Wizard of Oz  together. It totally dominated her imagination for months. Her favorite character was Glinda  of course. It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand. But you watch that movie enough times  and you start to realize how unusual it is. Now we live today  and are raising our children  in a kind of children's fantasy spectacular industrial complex. But  The Wizard of Oz  stood alone. It did not start that trend. Forty years later was when the trend really caught on  with  interestingly  another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards. Do you know what I'm talking about   Laughter  Yeah. Now  there's a big difference between these two movies  a couple of really big differences between  The Wizard of Oz  and all the movies we watch today. One is there's very little violence in  The Wizard of Oz.  The monkeys are rather aggressive  as are the apple trees. But I think if  The Wizard of Oz  were made today  the wizard would say   Dorothy  you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold. Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer generated armies of the Wicked Witch.  But that's not how it happens. Another thing that's really unique about  The Wizard of Oz  to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female. Now I started to notice this when I actually showed  Star Wars  to my daughter  which was years later  and the situation was different. At that point I also had a son. He was only three at the time. He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that. But he was the second child  and the level of supervision had plummeted.  Laughter  So he wandered in  and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling  and I don't think he understands what's going on  but he is sure soaking in it. And I wonder what he's soaking in. Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty  Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government  Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru  and of course this princess  who's really cool  but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe  which he does by the magic that he was born with  Compare this to      with  The Wizard of Oz.  How does Dorothy win her movie  By making friends with everybody and being a leader. That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in    Oz  right     and not the world of dudes fighting  which is where we kind of have to be. Why is there so much Force    capital F  Force    in the movies we have for our kids  and so little yellow brick road  There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy violent movie has on girls  and you should do that reading. It's very good. I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe. I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co ed.  Laughter  I think there was a first kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie  right  I finished my quest  I got the girl. Why are you still standing there  I don't know what I'm supposed to do. The movies are very  very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward  and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys. It's almost as though if you're a boy  you are a dopey animal  and if you are a girl  you should bring your warrior costume. There are plenty of exceptions  and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you. But they do send a message to boys  that they are not  the boys are not really the target audience. They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy  but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy. There's no models for them. And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids  and as three dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are  these are still war movies. And  of course  the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic  every single one of them about the journey of a boy  or a man  or two men who are friends  or a man and his son  or two men who are raising a little girl. Until  as many of you are thinking  this year  when they finally came out with  Brave.  I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now. Do you remember what the critics said when  Brave  came out   Aw  I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie.  It's very good. Don't let that stop you. Now  almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test. I don't know if you've heard of this. It has not yet caught on and caught fire  but maybe today we will start a movement. Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist  and back in the mid '  s  she recorded this conversation she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw. And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask  Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines  So try to meet that bar. And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie  And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like   Laughter  Right  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much. Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff. It does happen. I've seen it  and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love. In fact  this week I went to see a very high quality movie   Argo.  Right  Oscar buzz  doing great at the box office  a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is. It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test. And I don't think it should  because a lot of the movie  I don't know if you've seen it  but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis. We've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep  angst ridden conversations in this hideout  and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say   Are you coming to bed  honey   That's Hollywood for you. So let's look at the numbers.       of the     most popular movies  how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists  Eleven. It's not bad. It's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to Congress  so that's good. But there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down. Last year  The New York Times published a study that the government had done. Here's what it said. One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life. Now  I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment. I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that. I don't even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that  but something is going wrong  and when I hear that statistic  one of the things I think of is that's a lot of sexual assailants. Who are these guys  What are they learning  What are they failing to learn  Are they absorbing the story that a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward  which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak  Are we soaking up that story  You know  as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing  we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them. We have tools at our disposal like  girl power   and we hope that that will help  but I gotta wonder  is girl power going to protect them if  at the same time  actively or passively  we are training our sons to maintain their boy power  I mean  I think the Netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important  and I'm talking mainly to the dads here. I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood. The definition of manhood is already turning upside down. You've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner. They're throwing it up in the air. So our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this  some new relationship with each other  and I think we really have to show them  and model for them  how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them  and wants to be on their team  and stands up against the real bad guys  who are the men who want to abuse the women. And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test  if we can find them  and to seek out the heroines who are there  who show real courage  who bring people together  and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say   I want to be on their team   because they're going to be on their team. When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in  Star Wars   do you know what she said  Obi Wan. Obi Wan Kenobi and Glinda. What do these two have in common  Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress. I think these people are experts. I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else  and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential. Now  they are leaders. I like that kind of quest for my daughter  and I like that kind of quest for my son. I want more quests like that. I want fewer quests where my son is told   Go out and fight it alone   and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team  maybe a team led by women  to help other people become better and be better people  like the Wizard of Oz. Thank you. This is how war starts. One day you're living your ordinary life  you're planning to go to a party  you're taking your children to school  you're making a dentist appointment. The next thing  the telephones go out  the TVs go out  there's armed men on the street  there's roadblocks. Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation. It stops. I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine  a Bosnian friend  about what happened to her  because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like. She was walking to work one day in April        in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank. She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party. Great person. And suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of Sarajevo knocking everything out of its path. She thinks she's dreaming  but she's not. And she runs as any of us would have done and takes cover  and she hides behind a trash bin  in her high heels and her miniskirt. And as she's hiding there  she's feeling ridiculous  but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks   I feel like Alice in Wonderland going down the rabbit hole  down  down  down into chaos  and my life will never be the same again.  A few weeks later  my friend was in a crowd of people pushing with her infant son in her arms to give him to a stranger on a bus  which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe. And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front  crowds and crowds of people   Take my child  Take my child   and passing her son to someone through a window. And she didn't see him for years. The siege went on for three and a half years  and it was a siege without water  without power  without electricity  without heat  without food  in the middle of Europe  in the middle of the   th century. I had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege  and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there because it's taught me everything  not just about being a reporter  but about being a human being. I learned about compassion. I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes. I learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie. Most of all  I learned about love. Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos  I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors  share food  raise their children  drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life  helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals. I learned so much about myself. Martha Gellhorn  who's one of my heroes  once said   You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility.  I went on to cover many  many  many wars after that  so many that I lost count  but there was nothing like Sarajevo. Last April  I went back to a very strange    what I called a deranged high school reunion. What it was  was the   th anniversary of the siege  the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo  and I don't like the word  anniversary   because it sounds like a party  and this was not a party. It was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war  humanitarian aid workers  and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves. And the thing that struck me the most  that broke my heart  was walking down the main street of Sarajevo  where my friend Aida saw the tank coming    years ago  and in that road were more than        red chairs  empty  and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege  just in Sarajevo  not in all of Bosnia  and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it  and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children. I now cover Syria  and I started reporting it because I believed that it needs to be done. I believe a story there has to be told. I see  again  a template of the war in Bosnia. And when I first arrived in Damascus  I saw this strange moment where people didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend  and it was exactly the same in Bosnia and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes. People don't want to believe it's coming  so they don't leave  they don't leave before they can. They don't get their money out. They stay because you want to stay in your home. And then war and chaos descend. Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot. In       I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda. Between April and August        one million people were slaughtered. Now if those        chairs freaked me out with the sheer number  I want you just for a second to think of a million people. And to give you some example  I remember standing and looking down a road as far as I could see  at least a mile  and there were bodies piled twice my height of the dead. And that was just a small percentage of the dead. And there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes. So we learn a lot from war  and I mention Rwanda because it is one place  like South Africa  where nearly    years on  there is healing. Fifty six percent of the parliamentarians are women  which is fantastic  and there's also within the national constitution now  you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi. You're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity  which is  of course  what started the slaughter in the first place. And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story  or I find it beautiful. There was a group of children  mixed Hutus and Tutsis  and a group of women who were adopting them  and they lined up and one was just given to the next. There was no kind of compensation for  you're a Tutsi  you're a Hutu  you might have killed my mother  you might have killed my father. They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation  and I find this remarkable. So when people ask me how I continue to cover war  and why I continue to do it  this is why. When I go back to Syria  next week in fact  what I see is incredibly heroic people  some of them fighting for democracy  for things we take for granted every single day. And that's pretty much why I do it. In       I had a little baby boy  and I call him my miracle child  because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life  this ray of hope was born. And I called him Luca  which means  The bringer of light   because he does bring light to my life. But I'm talking about him because when he was four months old  my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards  and I remember getting on the plane in tears  crying to be separated from my son  and while I was there  a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine said to me   What are you doing here  Why aren't you home with Luca   And I said   Well  I have to see.  It was      which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq   I have to see  I have to see what is happening here. I have to report it.  And he said   Go home  because if you miss his first tooth  if you miss his first step  you'll never forgive yourself. But there will always be another war.  And there  sadly  will always be wars. And I am deluding myself if I think  as a journalist  as a reporter  as a writer  what I do can stop them. I can't. I'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war. He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it. I'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person. I'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor  and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt to have people dying in front of me  and I couldn't save them. All I am is a witness. My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless. A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world. And that's what I try to do. I'm not always successful  and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating  because you feel like you're writing into a void  or you feel like no one cares. Who cares about Syria  Who cares about Bosnia  Who cares about the Congo  the Ivory Coast  Liberia  Sierra Leone  all of these strings of places that I will remember for the rest of my life  But my m tier is to bear witness and that is the crux  the heart of the matter  for us reporters who do this. And all I can really do is hope  not to policymakers or politicians  because as much as I'd like to have faith that they read my words and do something  I don't delude myself. But what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast  if you can remember the story of Sarajevo  or the story of Rwanda  then I've done my job. Thank you very much. What I want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what's scheduled. Foreign policy  you can figure that out by watching  I don't know  Rachel Maddow or somebody  but    Laughter    I want to talk about young people and structure  young people and structure. This was last Wednesday afternoon at a school in Brooklyn  New York  at Cristo Rey High School  run by the Jesuits. And I was talking to this group of students  and take a look at them. They were around me in three directions. You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority. You'll notice that the building is rather austere. It's an old New York school building  nothing fancy. They still have old blackboards and whatnot. And there are about     kids in this school  and the school's been going now for four years  and they're about to graduate their first class. Twenty two people are graduating  and all    are going to college. They all come from homes where there is  for the most part  just one person in the home  usually the mother or the grandmother  and that's it  and they come here for their education and for their structure. Now I had this picture taken  and it was put up on my Facebook page last week  and somebody wrote in   Huh  why does he have him standing at attention like that   And then they said   But he looks good.   Laughter  He does look good  because kids need structure  and the trick I play in all of my school appearances is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids  I then invite them to ask questions  and when they raise their hands  I say   Come up   and I make them come up and stand in front of me. I make them stand at attention like a soldier. Put your arms straight down at your side  look up  open your eyes  stare straight ahead  and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear. No slouching  no pants hanging down  none of that stuff. And this young man  his name is    his last name Cruz    he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral. So people think I'm being unkind to this kid. No  we're having a little fun. And the thing about it  I've done this for years  the younger they are  the more fun it is. When I get six  and seven year olds in a group  I have to figure out how to keep them quiet. You know that they'll always start yakking. And so I play a little game with them before I make them stand at attention. I say   Now listen. In the army  when we want you to pay attention  we have a command. It's called 'at ease.' It means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up. Do you understand    Uh huh  uh huh  uh huh.  Let's practice. Everybody start chatting.  And I let them go for about    seconds  then I go   At ease    Huh    Laughter   Yes  General. Yes  General.  Try it with your kids. See if it works.  Laughter  I don't think so. But anyway  it's a game I play  and it comes obviously from my military experience. Because for the majority of my adult life  I worked with young kids  teenagers with guns  I call them. And we would bring them into the army  and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure  put them in ranks  make them all wear the same clothes  cut all their hair off so they look alike  make sure that they are standing in ranks. We teach them how to go right face  left face  so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions. It gives them structure. And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately  the drill sergeant. And they hate him. And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them  and telling them to do all kinds of awful things. But then the most amazing thing happens over time. Once that structure is developed  once they understand the reason for something  once they understand   Mama ain't here  son. I'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy. And that's just the way it is. You got that  son  Yeah  and then when I ask you a question  there are only three possible answers  yes  sir  no  sir  and no excuse  sir. Don't start telling me why you didn't do something. It's yes  sir  no  sir  no excuse  sir.   You didn't shave.  But sir     No  don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning. I'm telling you you didn't shave.   No excuse  sir.  Attaboy  you're learning fast.  But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure. In    weeks  they have a skill. They are mature. And you know what  they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant. They come to respect him. And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children. I spend a lot of time with youth groups  and I say to people   When does the education process begin   We're always talking about   Let's fix the schools. Let's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools. Let's get it all online.  That isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer. But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with. When does the learning process begin  Does it begin in first grade  No  no  it begins the first time a child in a mother's arms looks up at the mother and says   Oh  this must be my mother. She's the one who feeds me. Oh yeah  when I don't feel so good down there  she takes care of me. It's her language I will learn.  And at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age  but by three months  that's her. And if the person doing it  whether it's the mother or grandmother  whoever's doing it  that is when the education process begins. That's when language begins. That's when love begins. That's when structure begins. That's when you start to imprint on the child that  you are special  you are different from every other child in the world. And we're going to read to you.  A child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school. A child who doesn't know his or her colors or doesn't know how to tell time  doesn't know how to tie shoes  doesn't know how to do those things  and doesn't know how to do something that goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid  mind. Mind your manners  Mind your adults  Mind what you're saying  This is the way children are raised properly. And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they're  much to the distress of my children  they are acting just like we did. You know  You imprint them. And that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school. And I'm working at all the energy I have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool  we need Head Start  we need prenatal care. The education process begins even before the child is born  and if you don't do that  you're going to have difficulty. And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing  they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go  and then they realize they're not like the other first graders who know books  have been read to  can do their alphabet. And by the third grade  the kids who didn't have that structure and minding in the beginning start to realize they're behind  and what do they do  They act it out. They act it out  and they're on their way to jail or they're on their way to being dropouts. It's predictable. If you're not at the right reading level at third grade  you are a candidate for jail at age     and we have the highest incarceration rate because we're not getting our kids the proper start in life. The last chapter in my book is called  The Gift of a Good Start.  The gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life. I was privileged to have that kind of good start. I was not a great student. I was a public school kid in New York City  and I didn't do well at all. I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript from kindergarten through college. I wanted it when I was writing my first book. I wanted to see if my memory was correct  and  my God  it was.  Laughter  Straight C everywhere. And I finally bounced through high school  got into the City College of New York with a   .  average  which I shouldn't have been allowed in with  and then I started out in engineering  and that only lasted six months.  Laughter  And then I went into geology   rocks for jocks.  This is easy. And then I found ROTC. I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing  and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way. And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military. And I say to young kids everywhere  as you're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you  always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing  and when you find those two things together  man  you got it. That's what's going on. And that's what I found. Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there. I'd been there four and a half going on five years  and my grades were not doing particularly well  and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration. And so they said   But he does so well in ROTC. Look  he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else.  And so they said   Look  let's take his ROTC grades and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens.  And they did  and it brought me up to  . .  Laughter  Yep.  Laughter   Applause  They said   It's good enough for government work. Give him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again.  So they shipped me off to the army  and lo and behold  many years later  I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had.  Laughter  So  I tell young people everywhere  it ain't where you start in life  it's what you do with life that determines where you end up in life  and you are blessed to be living in a country that  no matter where you start  you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself  you believe in the society and the country  and you believe that you can self improve and educate yourself as you go along. And that's the key to success. But it begins with the gift of a good start. If we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids  if we don't invest at the earliest age  we're going to be running into difficulties. It's why we have a dropout rate of roughly    percent overall and almost    percent of our minority population living in low income areas  because they're not getting the gift of a good start. My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family  a good family  but having a family that said to me   Now listen  we came to this country in banana boats in      and     . We worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day. We're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose or get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out.  If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people that   You know  I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out   they'd said   We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid.  They had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx  but they had more than just expectations for us. They stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame   Don't you shame this family.  Sometimes I would get in trouble  and my parents were coming home  and I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen  and I would sit there saying to myself   Okay  look  take the belt and hit me  but  God  don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again.  It devastated me when my mother did that to me. And I also had this extended network. Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe  a family  a community. In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings. I don't know how many of you are New Yorkers  but there were these tenement buildings  and these women were always hanging out one of the windows  leaning on a pillow. They never left.  Laughter  I  so help me God  I grew up walking those streets  and they were always there. They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked.  Laughter  They never did anything. But what they did was keep us in play. They kept us in play. And they didn't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general  and they never expected any generals in the family  as long as you got an education and then you got a job.  Don't give us any of that self actualization stuff. You get a job and get out of the house. We don't have time to waste for that. And then you can support us. That's the role of you guys.  And so  it's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families  all families. And it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people  and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren  it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back and find kids like Mr. Cruz who can make it if you give them the structure  if you reach back and help  if you mentor  if you invest in boys and girls clubs  if you work with your school system  make sure it's the best school system  and not just your kid's school  but the school uptown in Harlem  not just downtown Montessori on the West Side. All of us have to have a commitment to do that. And we're not just investing in the kids. We're investing in our future. We're going to be a minority majority country in one more generation. Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority. And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority. We have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours  a country that is like no other  a country that amazes me every single day  a country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other. That's how the system's supposed to work. It's a country of such contrasts  but it's a nation of nations. We touch every nation. Every nation touches us. We are a nation of immigrants. That's why we need sound immigration policy. It's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation  or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty. One of the great stories I love to tell is about my love of going to my hometown of New York and walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world. But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler. Gotta have a dirty water dog.  Laughter  And no matter where I am or what I'm doing  I've got to do that. I even did it when I was Secretary of State. I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria    Laughter    be walking up the street  and I would hit around   th Street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler. In those days  I had five bodyguards around me and three New York City police cars would roll alongside to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue.  Laughter  And I would order the hot dog from the guy  and he'd start to fix it  and then he'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars     I've got a green card  I've got a green card    Laughter   It's okay  it's okay.  But now I'm alone. I'm alone. I've got no bodyguards  I've got no police cars. I've got nothing. But I gotta have my hot dog. I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening down by Columbus Circle. And the scene repeats itself so often. I'll go up and ask for my hot dog  and the guy will fix it  and as he's finishing  he'll say   I know you. I see you on television. You're  well  you're General Powell.   Yes  yes.  Oh ...   I hand him the money.  No  General. You can't pay me. I've been paid. America has paid me. I never forget where I came from. But now I'm an American. Sir  thank you.  I accept the generosity  continue up the street  and it washes over me  my God  it's the same country that greeted my parents this way    years ago. So we are still that magnificent country  but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world  and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind. Thank you very much. So I want to talk to you about two things tonight. Number one  Teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard. And second  that language is one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world. And in my little corner of the world  these two things are actually related  and I want to tell you how tonight. Now  nobody wants an operation. Who here has had surgery  Did you want it  Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation. Nobody wants an operation. In particular  nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain  that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school  that leave a big scar. But if you have to have an operation  what you really want is a minimally invasive operation. That's what I want to talk to you about tonight    how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator. Now  this type of surgery is hard  and it starts by putting people to sleep  putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen  blowing them up like a balloon  sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen    it's dangerous stuff    and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen. So let's see what it looks like. So this is gallbladder surgery. We perform a million of these a year in the United States alone. This is the real thing. There's no blood. And you can see how focused the surgeons are  how much concentration it takes. You can see it in their faces. It's hard to teach  and it's not all that easy to learn. We do about five million of these in the United States and maybe    million of these worldwide. All right  you've all heard the term   He's a born surgeon.  Let me tell you  surgeons are not born. Surgeons are not made either. There are no little tanks where we're making surgeons. Surgeons are trained one step at a time. It starts with a foundation  basic skills. We build on that and we take people  hopefully  to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant. Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training. And when they do all of that for about five years  they get the coveted board certification. If you need surgery  you want to be operated on by a board certified surgeon. You get your board certificate  and you can go out into practice. And eventually  if you're lucky  you achieve mastery. Now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the United States  SAGES  started in the late     s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures. Now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of Surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified. It's not a lecture  it's not a course  it's all of that plus a high stakes assessment. It's hard. Now just this past year  one of our partners  the American College of Surgeons  teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be FLS  Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery  certified before they do minimally invasive surgery. And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada  No  we just said all surgeons. So to lift this education and training worldwide is a very large task  something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world. SAGES does surgery all over the world  teaching and educating surgeons. So we have a problem  and one of the problems is distance. We can't travel everywhere. We need to make the world a smaller place. And I think that we can develop some tools to do so. And one of the tools I like personally is using video. So I was inspired by a friend. This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto. And he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing. So here's Allan teaching an English speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery. Very inspiring. But for this examination  which is really hard  we have a problem. Even people who say they speak English  only    percent pass. Because for them it's not a surgery test  it's an English test. Let me bring it to you locally. I work at the Cambridge Hospital. It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility. We have more than     translators covering    languages  and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital. It's a big labor intensive effort. If you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients    not just teaching surgeons  just trying to talk to your patients    there aren't enough translators in the world. We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest. At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week. And you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to. And there isn't always a translator available. So we need tools. We need a universal translator. One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world. It's really about setting up a dialogue. We have a lot to learn. Here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world. Maybe we have something to learn as well. So I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world. This past year I've been in Latin America  I've been in China  talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery. And everywhere I go the barrier is   We want this  but we need it in our language.  So here's what we think we want to do  Imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously. I want to talk to the people in Asia  Latin America  Africa  Europe seamlessly  accurately and in a cost effective fashion using technology. And it has to be bi directional. They have to be able to teach us something as well. It's a big task. So we looked for a universal translator  I thought there would be one out there. Your webpage has translation  your cellphone has translation  but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery. Because we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon  A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain. I need to have a health care lexicon. And in that I need a surgery lexicon. That's a tall order. We have to work at it. So let me show you what we're doing. This is research    can't buy it. We're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator. It starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology  we then add another technology to do video conferencing. But we don't have the words yet  so we add a third technology. And now we've got the words  and we can apply the special sauce  the translation. We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic. We work with a fourth technology. And we currently have access to eleven language pairs. More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place. And I'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful. Narrator  Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. Module five  manual skills practice. Students may display captions in their native language. Steven Schwaitzberg  If you're in Latin America  you click the  I want it in Spanish  button and out it comes in real time in Spanish. But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time  by using technology in a constructive fashion  you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian    on and on and on  simultaneously without the use of human translators. But that's the lectures. If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning  it's knowledge and skills. The difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much. So we're going to take it one step further  we've brought my friend Allan back. Allan Okrainec  Today we're going to practice suturing. This is how you hold the needle. Grab the needle at the tip. It's important to be accurate. Aim for the black dots. Orient your loop this way. Now go ahead and cut. Very good Oscar. I'll see you next week. SS  So that's what we're working on in our quest for the universal translator. We want it to be bi directional. We have a need to learn as well as to teach. I can think of a million uses for a tool like this. As we think about intersecting technologies    everybody has a cell phone with a camera    we could use this everywhere  whether it be health care  patient care  engineering  law  conferencing  translating videos. This is a ubiquitous tool. In order to break down our barriers  we have to learn to talk to people  to demand that people work on translation. We need it for our everyday life  in order to make the world a smaller place. Thank you very much. I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question  which has an equally disturbing answer. My topic is the secrets of domestic violence  and the question I'm going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks  Why does she stay  Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her  I'm not a psychiatrist  a social worker or an expert in domestic violence. I'm just one woman with a story to tell. I was   . I had just graduated from Harvard College. I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine. I had my first apartment  my first little green American Express card  and I had a very big secret. My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate  many  many times. The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember. I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love  a psychological trap disguised as love  one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year. It may even be your story. I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor. I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College  an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School. I've spent most of my career working for Fortune     companies including Johnson   Johnson  Leo Burnett and The Washington Post. I've been married for almost    years to my second husband and we have three kids together. My dog is a black lab  and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone    all races  all religions  all income and education levels. It's everywhere. And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women  that it's a women's issue. Not exactly. Over    percent of abusers are men  and domestic abuse happens only in intimate  interdependent  long term relationships  in other words  in families  the last place we would want or expect to find violence  which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing. I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me  but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age. I was     and in the United States  women ages    to    are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages  and over     women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners  boyfriends  and husbands in the United States. I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence  its warning signs or its patterns. I met Conor on a cold  rainy January night. He sat next to me on the New York City subway  and he started chatting me up. He told me two things. One was that he  too  had just graduated from an Ivy League school  and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank. But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy. He had these big cheeks  these big apple cheeks and this wheat blond hair  and he seemed so sweet. One of the smartest things Conor did  from the very beginning  was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship. He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me. We started dating  and he loved everything about me  that I was smart  that I'd gone to Harvard  that I was passionate about helping teenage girls  and my job. He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams. Conor believed in me  as a writer and a woman  in a way that no one else ever had. And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret  which was that  as a very young boy starting at age four  he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather  and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade  even though he was very smart  and he'd spent almost    years rebuilding his life. Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him. If you had told me that this smart  funny  sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup  how short my skirts were  where I lived  what jobs I took  who my friends were and where I spent Christmas  I would have laughed at you  because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning. I didn't know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim. I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim. Now  Conor did not come home one day and announce   You know  hey  all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great  but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you     Laughter     so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises.  Instead  Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day  his dream job  and he said that he had quit his job because of me  because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore  and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive  dysfunctional family  and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side. Now  the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York  and my dream job  but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate  so I agreed  and I quit my job  and Conor and I left Manhattan together. I had no idea I was falling into crazy love  that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical  financial and psychological trap. The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts. And here's where those guns come in. As soon as we moved to New England    you know  that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe    he bought three guns. He kept one in the glove compartment of our car. He kept one under the pillows on our bed  and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times. And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy. He needed them to feel protected. But those guns were really a message for me  and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me  my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day. Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding. It was   a.m. I still had on my nightgown. I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment  and I got frustrated  and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream  and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall. Five days later  the ten bruises on my neck had just faded  and I put on my mother's wedding dress  and I married him. Despite what had happened  I was sure we were going to live happily ever after  because I loved him  and he loved me so much. And he was very  very sorry. He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me. It was an isolated incident  and he was never going to hurt me again. It happened twice more on the honeymoon. The first time  I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost  and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver's side window. And then a few days later  driving home from our honeymoon  he got frustrated by traffic  and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face. Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage. I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation. One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life  and the CDC reports that    million children are abused every year     million. So actually  I was in very good company. Back to my question  Why did I stay  The answer is easy. I didn't know he was abusing me. Even though he held those loaded guns to my head  pushed me down stairs  threatened to kill our dog  pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway  poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview  I never once thought of myself as a battered wife. Instead  I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man  and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons. The other question everybody asks is  why doesn't she just leave  Why didn't I walk out  I could have left any time. To me  this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask  because we victims know something you usually don't  It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser. Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her. Over    percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship  after she's gotten out  because then the abuser has nothing left to lose. Other outcomes include long term stalking  even after the abuser remarries  denial of financial resources  and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children  who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother. And still we ask  why doesn't she just leave  I was able to leave  because of one final  sadistic beating that broke through my denial. I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him. So I broke the silence. I told everyone  the police  my neighbors  my friends and family  total strangers  and I'm here today because you all helped me. We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines  self destructive women  damaged goods. The question   Why does she stay   is code for some people for   It's her fault for staying   as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us. But since publishing  Crazy Love   I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out  who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened  and who rebuilt lives    joyous  happy lives    as employees  wives and mothers  lives completely free of violence  like me. Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor. I remarried a kind and gentle man  and we have those three kids. I have that black lab  and I have that minivan. What I will never have again  ever  is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me. Right now  maybe you're thinking   Wow  this is fascinating   or   Wow  how stupid was she   but this whole time  I've actually been talking about you. I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves. Abuse could be affecting your daughter  your sister  your best friend right now. I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence. I'm still breaking the silence today. It's my way of helping other victims  and it's my final request of you. Talk about what you heard here. Abuse thrives only in silence. You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it. We victims need everyone. We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence. Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children  your coworkers  your friends and family. Recast survivors as wonderful  lovable people with full futures. Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene  deescalate it  show victims a safe way out. Together we can make our beds  our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. Thank you. This is about a hidden corner of the labor market. It's the world of people who need to work ultra flexibly  if they're to work at all. So think  for instance  of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition  or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult  or a parent with complex child care needs. Their availability for work can be such that it's   A few hours today. Maybe I can work tomorrow  but I don't know if and when yet.  And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people to find the work that they so often need very badly. Which is a tragedy because there are employers who can use pools of very flexible local people booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work. Imagine that you run a cafe. It's mid morning  the place is filling up. You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush. If you could get two extra workers for    minutes to start in an hour's time  you'd do it  but they'd have to be reliable  inducted in how your cafe works. They'd have to be available at very competitive rates. They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute. In reality  no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business  so you are going to muddle by  understaffed. And it's not just caterers  it's hoteliers  it's retailers  it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses. There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people  possibly already once they've been inducted. At this level of the labor market  what you need is a marketplace for spare hours. They do exist. Here's how they work. So in this example  a distribution company has said  we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning. Show us everyone who's available. It's found    workers. Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow. They're all contactable in time for this booking. They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings. And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual. And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking. Of course  they're all trained to work in warehouses. You can select as many of them as you want. They're from multiple agencies. It's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking. And it's monitoring their reliability. The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones. They're likely to be more expensive. In an alternative view of this pool of local  very flexible people  here's a market research company  and it's inducted maybe    local people in how to do street interviewing. And they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week. And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted are available each hour next week. And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews. But is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market  Because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get. Let's make it personal. Imagine that a young woman    base of the economic pyramid  very little prospect of getting a job    what economic activity could she theoretically engage in  Well  she might be willing to work odd hours in a call center  in a reception area  in a mail room. She may be interested in providing local services to her community  babysitting  local deliveries  pet care. She may have possessions that she would like to trade at times she doesn't need them. So she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out. She might have a bike  a video games console she only uses occasionally. And you're probably thinking    because you're all very web aware    yes  and we're in the era of collaborative consumption  so she can go online and do all this. She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed  she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say   I want to do local deliveries   and so on. These are good sites  but I believe we can go a step further. And the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all. Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last    years  but only for organizations at the top of the economy. If you're a Wall Street trader  you now take it for granted that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time  executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set. It analyzes supply and demand and pricing and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from. It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways. It's all extremely low overhead. What have we gained at the bottom of the economy in terms of markets in the last    years  Basically classified adverts with a search facility. So why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading  and what the rest of us have  A modern market is more than a website  it's a web of interoperable marketplaces  back office mechanisms  regulatory regimes  settlement mechanisms  liquidity sources and so on. And when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning  she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today and then post that listing on multiple websites and wait for potential buyers to get in touch and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade. In the early days of this modern markets technology  the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power  their back office processes  their relationships  their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity. They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes  and in a lot of cases they got it. But throughout the economy  there are facilities that could likewise leverage a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us. And those facilities    I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity  the licensing authorities that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time  the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels. These mechanisms  these facilities are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo  they're controlled by the state. And the policymakers who sit on top of them are  I suggest  simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used to underpin a whole new era of markets. Like everyone else  those policymakers are taking it for granted that modern markets are the preserve of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves. Suppose we stopped taking that for granted. Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.  or the leader of any other developed nation  woke up and said   I'm never going to be able to create all the jobs I need in the current climate. I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens. And for that they have to be able to access state of the art markets. How do I make that happen   And I think I can see a few eyes rolling. Politicians in a big  complex  sophisticated I.T. project  Oh  that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen. Not necessarily. There is a precedent for technology enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful  national lotteries. Let's take Britain as an example. Our government didn't design the national lottery  it didn't fund the national lottery  it doesn't operate the national lottery. It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed. This act defines what a national lottery will look like. It specifies certain benefits that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators. And it puts some obligations on those operators. In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses  this was an unqualified success. But let's suppose that our aim is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid. Could we use the same model  I believe we could. So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility. Let's call it national e markets  NEMs for short. Think of it as a regulated public utility. So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network. And it's a series of markets for low level trade that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company. And government has certain benefits it can uniquely bestow on these markets. It's about public spending going through these markets to buy public services at the local level. It's about interfacing these markets direct into the highest official channels in the land. It's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets. It's about deregulating some sectors so that local people can enter them. So  taxi journeys might be one example. And there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators  and the key one is  of course  that the operators pay for everything  including all the interfacing into the public sector. So imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction. Imagine that there's a concession period defined of maybe    years in which they can take all these benefits and run with them. And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told  whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction to fund the whole thing will get the deal. So government then exits the frame. This is now in the hands of the consortium. Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity and make a percentage on all of it or it's all going to crash and burn  which is tough on their shareholders. It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily. And there would be no constraints on alternative markets. So this would just be one more choice among millions of Internet forums. But it could be very different  because having access to those state backed facilities could incentivize this consortium to seriously invest in the service. Because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going to start making their return. So we're talking about sectors like home hair care  the hire of toys  farm work  hire of clothes even  meals delivered to your door  services for tourists  home care. This would be a world of very small trades  but very well informed  because national e markets will deliver data. So this is a local person potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market. And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market. They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents who wanted a pool of babysitters. Is it worth their while  Should they be looking at other sectors  Should they be moving to another part of the country where there's a shortage of babysitters  This kind of data can become routine. And this data can be used by investors. So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training  an investor can pay for it and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals for maybe the next two years. This is a world of atomized capitalism. So it's small trades by small people  but it's very informed  safe  convenient  low overhead and immediate. Some rough research suggests this could unlock around     million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity in a country the size of the U.K. Does that sound improbable to you  That's what a lot of people said about turbo trading in financial exchanges    years ago. Do not underestimate the transformative power of truly modern markets. Thank you. It was a Saturday afternoon in May  and I suddenly realized that the next day was Mother's Day  and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom  so I started thinking about what should I get my mom for Mother's Day  I thought  why don't I make her an interactive Mother's Day card using the Scratch software that I'd been developing with my research group at the MIT Media Lab  We developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and animations  and then share their creations with one another. So I thought  this would be an opportunity to use Scratch to make an interactive card for my mom. Before making my own Mother's Day card  I thought I would take a look at the Scratch website. So over the last several years  kids around the world ages   and up  have shared their projects  and I thought  I wonder if  of those three million projects  whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards. So in the search box I typed in  Mother's Day   and I was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards that showed up on the Scratch website  many of them just in the past    hours by procrastinators just like myself. So I started taking a look at them.  Music  I saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day. And the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom. Another one was an interactive project where  when you moved the mouse over the letters of  Happy Mom Day   it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan. about how she had Googled to find out when Mother's Day was happening. she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting of how much she loved her mom. So I really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects. In fact  I liked it so much that  instead of making my own project  I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects.  Laughter  And actually  she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would. She wrote back to me and she said   I'm so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers.  So my mom was happy  and that made me happy  but actually I was even happier for another reason. I was happy because these kids were using Scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would. As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards  you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies. What do I mean by fluent  I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves and to start expressing their ideas. When you become fluent with language  it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend. And it's similar with new technologies. By writing  be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards  these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies. Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this  because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology. I mean  all of us have heard young people referred to as  digital natives.  But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term. I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives. When you really look at it  how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies  You often see them in situations like this  or like this  and there's no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming. But that doesn't really make you fluent. So young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies  but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies. It's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies. And I'm really interested in seeing  how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies  And that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs  or code. So  increasingly  people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code. You know  in recent years  there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code. You look online  you'll see places like Codecademy and events like CoderDojo and sites like Girls Who Code  or Black Girls Code. It seems that everybody is getting into the act. You know  just at the beginning of this year  at the turn of the new year  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn to code in     . A few months later  the country of Estonia decided that all of its first graders should learn to code. And that triggered a debate in the U.K. about whether all the children there should learn to code. Now  for some of you  when you hear about this  it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code. When many people think of coding  they think of it as something that only a very narrow sub community of people are going to be doing  and they think of coding looking like this. And in fact  if this is what coding is like  it will only be a narrow sub community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background that can code. But coding doesn't have to be like this. Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch. So in Scratch  to code  you just snap blocks together. In this case  you take a move block  snap it into a stack  and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story  in this case controlling the big fish. After you've created your program  you can click on  share   and then share your project with other people  so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well. So  of course  making a fish game isn't the only thing you can do with Scratch. Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website  there's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork  and  yes  interactive Mother's Day cards. So I think there's so many different ways that people can express themselves using this  to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world. And it doesn't just stay on the screen. You can also code to interact with the physical world around you. Here's an example from Hong Kong  where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor  so the light sensor detects the hole in the board  so as they move the physical saw  the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree. We're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us. This is an example from a new version of Scratch that we'll be releasing in the next few months  and we're looking again to be able to push you in new directions. Here's an example. It uses the webcam. And as I move my hand  I can pop the balloons or I can move the bug. So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect  where you interact with gestures in the world. But instead of just playing someone else's game  you get to create the games  and if you see someone else's game  you can just say  see inside   and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it. So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is  and then  if there's so much video motion  it will then tell the balloon to pop. The same way that this uses the camera to get information into Scratch  you can also use the microphone. Here's an example of a project using the microphone. So I'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices. As kids are creating projects like this  they're learning to code  but even more importantly  they're coding to learn. Because as they learn to code  it enables them to learn many other things  opens up many new opportunities for learning. Again  it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing. When you learn to read and write  it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things. When you learn to read  you can then read to learn. And it's the same thing with coding. If you learn to code  you can code to learn. Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious. You learn more about how computers work. But that's just where it starts. When you learn to code  it opens up for you to learn many other things. Let me show you an example. Here's another project  and I saw this when I was visiting one of the computer clubhouses. These are after school learning centers that we helped start that help young people from low income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies. And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago  I saw a    year old boy who was using our Scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one  and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game  but also he wanted to do more. He wanted to keep score. So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish  but he wanted to keep score  so that each time the big fish eats the little fish  the score would go up and it would keep track  and he didn't know how to do that. So I showed him. In Scratch  you can create something called a variable. I'll call it score. And that creates some new blocks for you  and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score  so each time I click on  change score   it increments the score. So I showed this to the clubhouse member    let's call him Victor    and Victor  when he saw that this block would let him increment the score  he knew exactly what to do. He took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish. So then  each time the big fish eats the little fish  he will increment the score  and the score will go up by one. And it's in fact working. And he saw this  and he was so excited  he reached his hand out to me  and he said   Thank you  thank you  thank you.  And what went through my mind was  how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables   Laughter  It doesn't happen in most classrooms  but that's because in most classrooms  when kids learn about variables  they don't know why they're learning it. It's nothing that  really  they can make use of. When you learn ideas like this in Scratch  you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you  that you can understand the reason for learning variables  and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better. Victor had  I'm sure  been taught about variables in schools  but he really didn't    he wasn't paying attention. Now he had a reason for learning variables. So when you learn through coding  and coding to learn  you're learning it in a meaningful context  and that's the best way of learning things. So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this  they're learning important concepts like variables  but that's just the start. As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts  he was also learning about the process of design  how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully fledged  functioning project like you see here. So he was learning many different core principles of design  about how to experiment with new ideas  how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts  how to collaborate with other people on your projects  about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong  how to keep persistent and to persevere in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well. Now those are important skills that aren't just relevant for coding. They're relevant for all sorts of different activities. Now  who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist  It's probably not so likely  but regardless of what he does  he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned. Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer  that these ideas are useful for everybody. Again  it's useful to think about this analogy with language. When you become fluent with reading and writing  it's not something that you're doing just to become a professional writer. Very few people become professional writers. But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write. Again  the same thing with coding. Most people won't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers  but those skills of thinking creatively  reasoning systematically  working collaboratively    skills you develop when you code in Scratch    are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives. And it's not just about your work life. Coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life. Let me end with just one more example. So this is an example that came from after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom  she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch. So she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card. Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design  and you can rest assured that my    year old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist. But working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself. So as we take a look and we see that Michael Bloomberg is learning to code  all of the children of Estonia learn to code  even my mom has learned to code  don't you think it's about time that you might be thinking about learning to code  If you're interested in giving it a try  I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website. It's scratch.mit.edu  and give a try at coding. Thanks very much.  Applause  Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other    Is that person dangerous  Are they attractive  Are they a potential mate  Are they a potential networking opportunity  We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them. What's your name  Where are you from  How old are you  What do you do  Then we get more personal with it. Have you ever had any diseases  Have you ever been divorced  Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now  What are you into  Who are you into  What gender do you like to sleep with  I get it. We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves. We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough to know what acceptance feels like. We bond together based on anything that we can    music preference  race  gender  the block that we grew up on. We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices. Sometimes  though  just the question  what do you do   can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it. Because the categories  I've found  are too limiting. The boxes are too narrow. And this can get really dangerous. So here's a disclaimer about me  though  before we get too deep into this. I grew up in a very sheltered environment. I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early     s  two blocks from the epicenter of punk music. I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously based upbringing. Where I come from  if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind  you were the weirdo. It was an unorthodox upbringing  but as a kid on the streets of New York  you learn how to trust your own instincts  you learn how to go with your own ideas. So when I was six  I decided that I wanted to be a boy. I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them. They said they wouldn't let girls play. So I went home  and I shaved my head  and I came back the next day and I said   I'm a boy.  I mean  who knows  right  When you're six  maybe you can do that. I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl  and they didn't. I kept up the charade for eight years. So this is me when I was   . I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called  Julian Po.  I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him. See  I was also a child actor  which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity  because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy. In fact  no one in my life knew that I was a girl    not my teachers at school  not my friends  not the directors that I worked with. Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with. When I would go to the bathroom  I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up. At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me without outing myself. It's worth mentioning though that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia. I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body. I felt like I was performing this elaborate act. I wouldn't have qualified as transgender. If my family  though  had been the kind of people to believe in therapy  they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty. But in my particular case  I just woke up one day when I was     and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again. Puberty had hit  and I had no idea what being a girl meant  and I was ready to figure out who I actually was. When a kid behaves like I did  they don't exactly have to come out  right  No one is exactly shocked. But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents. When I was     and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love  it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl. Three years later  when I fell in love with a man  neither of my parents batted an eyelash either. See  it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn't ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point. I was just allowed to be me  growing and changing in every moment. So four  almost five years ago  Proposition    the great marriage equality debate  was raising a lot of dust around this country. And at the time  getting married wasn't really something I spent a lot of time thinking about. But I was struck by the fact that America  a country with such a tarnished civil rights record  could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly. And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country  between places where people believed in it and places where people didn't. And then  that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me. If this was a war with two disparate sides  I  by default  fell on team gay  because I certainly wasn't     percent straight. At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy  over compensating  boy chasing girly girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was  a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person. I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls  much like myself  who fell kind of between the lines    girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear  girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish  girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees  girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything. I loved these people  and I admired their freedom  but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television. And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority  and in my own home country  based on one facet of my character. I was legally and indisputably a second class citizen. I was not an activist. I wave no flags in my own life. But I was plagued by this question  How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character  How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else  Were we even a group  What group  And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination  Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was  And then it occurred to me  perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do. It might give them pause. Obviously I couldn't get    million people to the same dinner party  so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice  without any lighting  or without any manipulation of any kind on my part. Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off. For me  photography is not just about exposing film  it's about exposing the viewer to something new  a place they haven't gone before  but most importantly  to people that they might be afraid of. Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant  far off cultures they never knew existed through pictures. So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits  mugshots if you will. And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not     percent straight  which  if you don't know  is a limitless number of people. So this was a very large undertaking  and to do it we needed some help. So I ran out in the freezing cold  and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago. And I took those photographs  and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help. And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York. And then we made this. Video  I'm iO Tillett Wright  and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City. Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today. My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who's anything other than     percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way. My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face.  We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal.  It's written in the Declaration of Independence. We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded. There is no equality in the United States.   What does equality mean to you      Marriage     Freedom     Civil rights     Treat every person as you'd treat yourself   It's when you don't have to think about it  simple as that. The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage. Today in    states  more than half of this country  you can legally be fired just for your sexuality.   Who is responsible for equality    I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer   We are all responsible for equality.  So far we've shot     faces in New York City. And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign. I want to take the project across the country. I want to visit    American cities  and I want to shoot       or       people. This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation. I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.   Self evident truths           faces across America   iO Tillett Wright  Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that. Almost        people watched that video  and then they started emailing us from all over the country  asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces. And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated. So I changed my immediate goal to        faces. That video was made in the spring of       and as of today I have traveled to almost    cities and photographed almost       people. I know that this is a talk  but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them. Because if a picture is worth a thousand words  then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary. So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small town Texas  we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on. Visibility really is key. Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy. Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family  you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it. Of course  in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight  but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian. Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths. But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting  Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us. In fact  on the contrary  it highlights them. It presents  not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings  but the complexities found within each individual person. It wasn't that we had too many boxes  it was that we had too few. At some point I realized that my mission to photograph  gays  was inherently flawed  because there were a million different shades of gay. Here I was trying to help  and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid    yet another box. At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to     percent gay. And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me. People didn't know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before. Can you quantify your openness  Once they got over the shock  though  by and large people opted for somewhere between    to    percent or the   to    percent marks. Of course  there were lots of people who opted for a     percent one or the other  but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced. I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as  Grey.  Let me be clear though    and this is very important    in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist. And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative  because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice  I invite you to go out and try to be grey. I'll take your picture just for trying. What I am saying though is that human beings are not one dimensional. The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this  If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here  and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another  there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between. And the reality that this presents is a complicated one. Because  for example  if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior  where exactly do you draw the line  Is it over here  by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far  Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far  Where exactly does one become a second class citizen  Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is. After traveling so much and meeting so many people  let me tell you  there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race. Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs  and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle  just being other than straight doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common. So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming  as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms  bus shelters  billboards  Facebook pages  screen savers  perhaps in watching this procession of humanity  something interesting and useful will begin to happen. Hopefully these categories  these binaries  these over simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away. Because really  they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are. What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity. And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity. At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights. So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing  the right to adopt children  the right to marriage  the freedom to shop here  live here  buy here  Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father  your neighbor  your cousin  your uncle  the president  your police woman or the fireman  It's too late. Because I already am all of those things. We already are all of those things  and we always have been. So please don't greet us as strangers  greet us as your fellow human beings  period. Thank you. Salaam alaikum. Welcome to Doha. I am in charge of making this country's food secure. That is my job for the next two years  to design an entire master plan  and then for the next    years to implement it    of course  with so many other people. But first  I need to talk to you about a story  which is my story  about the story of this country that you're all here in today. And of course  most of you have had three meals today  and probably will continue to have after this event. So going in  what was Qatar in the     s  We were about        people living here. There was no water. There was no energy  no oil  no cars  none of that. Most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages  fishing  or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water. None of the glamour that you see today existed. No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh. It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities. Resources weren't there to develop them. And you can see that life expectancy was also short. Most people died around the age of   . So let's move to chapter two  the oil era.       that's when they discovered oil. But unfortunately  it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War. What did it do  It changed the face of this country  as you can see today and witness. It also made all those people who roamed around the desert    looking for water  looking for food  trying to take care of their livestock    urbanize. You might find this strange  but in my family we have different accents. My mother has an accent that is so different to my father  and we're all a population of about         people in the same country. There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak. Someone says   How so  How could this happen   Because we lived scattered. We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources. And when the resources came  be it oil  we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration. People started to get to know each other. And we realized that there are some differences in accents. So that is the chapter two  the oil era. Let's look at today. This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha. So what's the population today  It's  .  million people. That is in less than    years. The average growth of our economy is about    percent for the past five years. Lifespan has increased to   . Water consumption has increased to     liters. And this is amongst the highest worldwide. From having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree  higher than any other nation. I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water. But what is interesting about the story that I've just said  The interesting part is that we continue to grow    percent every year for the past five years without water. Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history. Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water. This is history being made in this region. Not only cities that we're building  but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists  doctors. Build a nice home  bring the architect  design my house. These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't. But of course  with the use of technology. So Brazil has       millimeters per year of precipitation of rain. Qatar has     and we have that growth rate. The question is how. How could we survive that  We have no water whatsoever. Simply because of this gigantic  mammoth machine called desalination. Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything. It is that thing that we pump out of the ground  we burn tons of  probably most of you used it coming to Doha. So that is our lake  if you can see it. That is our river. That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water. This is the best technology that this region could ever have  desalination. So what are the risks  Do you worry much  I would say  perhaps if you look at the global facts  you will realize  of course I have to worry. There is growing demand  growing population. We've turned seven billion only a few months ago. And so that number also demands food. And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by     . So a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders. There's also changing diets. By elevating to a higher socio economic level  they also change their diet. They start eating more meat and so on and so forth. On the other hand  there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors. And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen. This is the situation in Qatar  for those who don't know. We only have two days of water reserve. We import    percent of our food  and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land. The limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions  etc.  etc. So we also face risks. These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity. The question is  is there a solution  Is there a sustainable solution  Indeed there is. This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we've been working on over the past two years. Let's start with the water. So we know very well    I showed you earlier    that we need this energy. So if we're going to need energy  what sort of energy  A depletable energy  Fossil fuel  Or should we use something else  Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy  I guess most of you by now realize that we do      days of sun. And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need. And we will probably put       megawatts of solar systems to produce  .  million cubic meters of water. And that is a lot of water. That water will go then to the farmers  and the farmers will be able to water their plants  and they will be able then to supply society with food. But in order to sustain the horizontal line    because these are the projects  these are the systems that we will deliver    we need to also develop the vertical line  system sustenance  high level education  research and development  industries  technologies  to produce these technologies for application  and finally markets. But what gels all of it  what enables it  is legislation  policies  regulations. Without it we can't do anything. So that's what we are planning to do. Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation. Our objective is to be a millennium city  just like many millennium cities around  Istanbul  Rome  London  Paris  Damascus  Cairo. We are only    years old  but we want to live forever as a city  to live in peace. Thank you very much.
