We are drowning in news. Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year. That's just one source. My question is  How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run  That's the idea behind The Long News. It's a project by The Long Now Foundation  which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand. And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter    or     or        years from now. And when you look at the news through that filter  a lot falls by the wayside. To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year  is this going to matter in a decade  Or this  Or this  Really  Is this going to matter in    or     years  Okay  that was kind of cool. But the top story of this past year was the economy  and I'm just betting that  sooner or later  this particular recession is going to be old news. So  what kind of stories might make a difference for the future  Well  let's take science. Someday  little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things. That someday is already here if you're a mouse. Some recent stories  nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom  they're sending genes into the brain  a robot they built that can crawl through the human body. What about resources  How are we going to feed nine billion people  We're having trouble feeding six billion today. As we heard yesterday  there's over a billion people hungry. Britain will starve without genetically modified crops. Bill Gates  fortunately  has bet a billion on  agricultural  research. What about global politics  The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda  and they may. They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market  they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter  and they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers. We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know. Some recent discoveries  There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica  there's a self directed robot scientist that's made a discovery    soon  science may no longer need us  and life may no longer need us either  a microbe wakes up after         years. It seems that with or without us  life will go on. But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this one  water found on the moon. Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there. And if NASA doesn't do it  China might  or somebody in this room might write a big check. My point is this  In the long run  some news stories are more important than others. Ladies and gentlemen  at TED we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement. So let's watch a movement happen  start to finish  in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it. First  of course you know  a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed. What he's doing is so easy to follow. Here's his first follower with a crucial role  he's going to show everyone else how to follow. Now  notice that the leader embraces him as an equal. Now it's not about the leader anymore  it's about them  plural. Now  there he is calling to his friends. Now  if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that. The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader. And here comes a second follower. Now it's not a lone nut  it's not two nuts    three is a crowd  and a crowd is news. So a movement must be public. It's important to show not just the leader  but the followers  because you find that new followers emulate the followers  not the leader. Now  here come two more people  and immediately after  three more people. Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point. Now we've got a movement. So  notice that  as more people join in  it's less risky. So those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to. They won't stand out  they won't be ridiculed  but they will be part of the in crowd if they hurry. So  over the next minute  you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in. And that's how you make a movement. But let's recap some lessons from this. So first  if you are the type  like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone  remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement  not you. Okay  but we might have missed the real lesson here. The biggest lesson  if you noticed    did you catch it     is that leadership is over glorified. Yes  it was the shirtless guy who was first  and he'll get all the credit  but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader. So  as we're told that we should all be leaders  that would be really ineffective. If you really care about starting a movement  have the courage to follow and show others how to follow. And when you find a lone nut doing something great  have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in. And what a perfect place to do that  at TED. Thanks. Now  I want to start with a question  When was the last time you were called  childish   For kids like me  being called childish can be a frequent occurrence. Every time we make irrational demands  exhibit irresponsible behavior  or display any other signs of being normal American citizens  we are called childish. Which really bothers me. After all  take a look at these events  Imperialism and colonization  world wars  George W. Bush. Ask yourself  who's responsible  Adults. Now  what have kids done  Well  Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust. Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States. And  most recently  Charlie Simpson helped to raise         pounds for Haiti  on his little bike. So as you can see evidenced by such examples  age has absolutely nothing to do with it. The traits the word  childish  addresses are seen so often in adults  that we should abolish this age discriminatory word  when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking. Thank you. Then again  who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs  Maybe you've had grand plans before  but stopped yourself  thinking   That's impossible   or  That costs too much   or  That won't benefit me.  For better or worse  we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things. Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking  like my wish that no one went hungry  or that everything were free  a kind of utopia. How many of you still dream like that  and believe in the possibilities  Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of Utopian ideals can be a burden  because you know that if everything were free  then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos. On the other hand  we kids still dream about perfection. And that's a good thing  because in order to make anything a reality  you have to dream about it first. In many ways  our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility. For instance  the Museum of Glass in Tacoma  Washington  my home state    yoohoo  Washington  has a program called Kids Design Glass  and kids draw their own ideas for glass art. The resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from the program  because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes  they just think of good ideas. Now  when you think of glass  you might think of colorful Chihuly designs  or maybe Italian vases  but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that  into the realm of brokenhearted snakes and bacon boys  who you can see has meat vision. Now  our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge. Kids already do a lot of learning from adults  and we have a lot to share. I think that adults should start learning from kids. Now  I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd    teachers and students  and I like this analogy  It shouldn't be a teacher at the head of the class  telling students   Do this  do that.  The students should teach their teachers. Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal. The reality  unfortunately  is a little different  and it has a lot to do with trust  or a lack of it. Now  if you don't trust someone  you place restrictions on them  right  If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the    percent interest I established on her last loan  I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me  until she pays it back. True story  by the way. Now  adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids  from every  Don't do that  don't do this  in the school handbook  to restrictions on school Internet use. As history points out  regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control. And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes  kids have no or very little say in making the rules  when really  the attitude should be reciprocal  meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population. Now  what's even worse than restriction  is that adults often underestimate kids' abilities. We love challenges  but when expectations are low  trust me  we will sink to them. My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister. Okay  so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that  but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters  when lots of other kids were hearing  The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round.  Well  we heard that one too  but  Pioneer Germ Fighters  totally rules. I loved to write from the age of four  and when I was six  my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word. Thank you  Bill Gates  and thank you  Ma. I wrote over     short stories on that little laptop  and I wanted to get published. Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published  or saying wait until you're older  my parents were really supportive. Many publishers were not quite so encouraging. One large children's publisher ironically said that they didn't work with children. Children's publisher not working with children  I don't know  you're kind of alienating a large client there. One publisher  Action Publishing  was willing to take that leap and trust me  and to listen to what I had to say. They published my first book   Flying Fingers   you see it here. And from there on  it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools  keynoting to thousands of educators  and finally  today  speaking to you. I appreciate your attention today  because to show that you truly care  you listen. But there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults. Kids grow up and become adults just like you. Or just like you  Really  The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult  but rather  better adults than you have been  which may be a little challenging  considering your guys' credentials. But the way progress happens  is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones. It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore. No matter your position or place in life  it is imperative to create opportunities for children  so that we can grow up to blow you away. Adults and fellow TEDsters  you need to listen and learn from kids  and trust us and expect more from us. You must lend an ear today  because we are the leaders of tomorrow  which means we're going to take care of you when you're old and senile. No  just kidding. No  really  we are going to be the next generation  the ones who will bring this world forward. And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you  remember that cloning is possible  and that involves going through childhood again  in which case you'll want to be heard  just like my generation. Now  the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas. Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed. Are you ready to make the match  Because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  People do stupid things. That's what spreads HIV.  This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper  The Guardian  not that long ago. I'm curious  show of hands  who agrees with it  Well  one or two brave souls. This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for    years  worked on four continents  and you're looking at her. And I am now going to argue that this is only half true. People do get HIV because they do stupid things  but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons. Now   rational  is the dominant paradigm in public health  and if you put your public health nerd glasses on  you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them  if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information  and a little bit of motivation  people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives. Wonderful. That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV  and although I'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality  and if you were at TED '   it's about coffee prices ... Actually  HIV's about sex and drugs  and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational  they are erections and addiction. So  let's start with what's rational for an addict. Now  I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine  Frankie. We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection. It was someone's birthday  and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail  and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues. And so everyone lined up  all the smackheads in a row  and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit  and he went down and started injecting people. So he injects the first guy  and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt  and he injects the next guy. And Frankie says   I'm number    in line  and I can see the needle coming down towards me  and there is blood all over the place. It's getting blunter and blunter. And a small part of my brain is thinking  'That is so gross and really dangerous ' but most of my brain is thinking  'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me. Please let there be some left.'  And then  telling me this story  Frankie said   You know ... God  drugs really make you stupid.  And  you know  you can't fault him for accuracy. But  actually  Frankie  at that time  was a heroin addict and he was in jail. So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high. And if there's one place you really want to get high  it's when you're in jail. But I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes  so let's look at some data. We talked to     drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia  and we said   Well  do you know how you get HIV    Oh yeah  by sharing needles.  I mean  nearly     percent. Yeah  by sharing needles. And   Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that    Oh yeah.  Hundred percent.  We're smackheads  we know where to get clean needles.   So are you carrying a needle   We're actually interviewing people on the street  in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.  Are you carrying clean needles   One in four  maximum. So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in     and the other nine in    are sharing. So you've got this massive mismatch  everyone knows that if they share they're going to get HIV  but they're all sharing anyway. So what's that about  Is it like you get a better high if you share or something  We asked that to a junkie and they're like   Are you nuts   You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with. There's just kind of an ick factor there.  No  no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail.  So  in Indonesia at this time  if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up  they could put you into jail. And that changes the equation slightly  doesn't it  Because your choice now is either I use my own needle now  or I could share a needle now and get a disease that's going to possibly kill me    years from now  or I could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow. And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV  they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway. So  suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles. Now  let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view. This is a really easy problem. For once  your incentives are aligned. We've got what's rational for public health. You want people to use clean needles    and junkies want to use clean needles. So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest. Now  the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well known  bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher. And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program  and other countries followed suit  Australia  The Netherlands and few others. And in all of those countries  you can see  not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV. Now  places that didn't do this    New York City for example  Moscow  Jakarta    we're talking  at its peak  one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease. Now  Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies. She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service. So  if she didn't invest in effective prevention  she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on  and obviously those are much higher. So she was making a politically rational decision. Now  if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data  it seems like a no brainer  doesn't it  But in this country  where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens   Laughter  we've taken a very different approach. So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data    endlessly reviewing the data. So  these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States  and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective    quite a lot of them. Now  the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective    you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up  but no    that's the whole slide. There is nothing on the other side. So  completely irrational  you would think. Except that  wait a minute  politicians are rational  too  and they're responding to what they think the voters want. So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this. So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors. Now let's talk about sex. Are we any more rational about sex  Well  I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church  who think somehow that if you give out condoms  everyone's going to run out and have sex. I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online  but if you do  I've got news for you Benedict    I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid. It's not that easy  Here  maybe you'll have better luck. Okay  seriously  HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually. So  it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids. And what we've got is a very  very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected  then you start making antibodies  and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time       or    years    you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection. But basically  nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS  and by that stage  you're not looking great  you're not feeling great  you're not having that much sex. So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia. Now  this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups  and that's considered stigmatizing. I've always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing  whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing  but we'll leave that be. The truth is that    years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time. And those groups are  globally  people who sell sex and their more regular partners. They are gay men on the party scene who have  on average  three times more partners than straight people on the party scene. And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy  and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa. And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today. You can see these horrifying figures from Africa. These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven  and one in three of all adults  are infected with HIV. Now  in the rest of the world  we've got basically nothing going on in the general population    very  very low levels    but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk  drug injectors  sex workers and gay men. And you'll note  that's the local data from Los Angeles     percent prevalence among gay men. Of course  you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex. You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person. In most of the world  these few prevention failures notwithstanding  we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex  condom use rates are between    and     percent in commercial sex in most countries. And  again  it's because of an alignment of the incentives. What's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it's really bad for business to have another STI. No one wants it. And  actually  clients don't want to go home with a drip either. So essentially  you're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex. But in  intimate  relations it's much more difficult because  with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things  we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy  and nothing is quite so unromantic as the   My condom or yours  darling   question. So in the face of that  you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms. This  for example  this gentleman is called Joseph. He's from Haiti and he has AIDS. And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now  but he is a reminder in the population  of why you might want to be using condoms. This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex  perhaps. Now  funnily enough  this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment. Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect. But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision making. So  what we've got    some people say   Oh  it doesn't matter very much because  actually  treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV.  So  if you look at the viremia thing again  if you do start treatment when you're sick  well  what happens  Your viral load comes down. But compared to what  What happens if you're not on treatment  Well  you die  so your viral load goes to zero. And all of this green stuff here  including the spikes    which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy  or you ran out of drugs  or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs  or because you've started to get resistance  or whatever    all of that is virus that wouldn't be out there  except for treatment. Now  am I saying   Oh  well  great prevention strategy. Let's just stop treating people.  Of course not  of course not. We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can. But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need. That's simply not necessarily true  and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on    years now. And what we've seen is that  actually  condom use rates  which were very  very high    the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV  with extremely little help from public health nerds  I would say    that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really  One is the assumption of   Oh well  if he's infected  he's probably on meds  and his viral load's going to be low  so I'm pretty safe.  And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS  and rightly so. AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you  and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day. And that's boring  but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex  no matter how drunk you are  no matter how many poppers you've taken  whatever  If we look at the data  we can see that the answer to that question is  mmm. So these are data from Scotland. You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program. Then it came way down. And both in heterosexuals    mostly in commercial sex    and in drug users  you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins  and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier. But in gay men  you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available. This is of new infections. What does that mean  It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population    more people living longer  healthier lives  more likely to be getting laid with HIV    is outweighing the effects of lower viral load  and that's a very worrisome thing. What does it mean  It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have. Is that what's happening  No  and I call it the  compassion conundrum.  We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days  and what's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers  unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies. But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims  we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives. It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view. I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines. Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta  she's a chick with a dick. Why does she do that job  Well  of course  because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option  etc.  etc. And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory  all would be well. This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia  on average     cents. It varies a bit province to province. I do speak to sex workers         of them for this particular slide  and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour. So it's not a great job  but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice. Okay  Ines. We've got the tools  the knowledge and the cash  and commitment to preventing HIV too. Ines  So why is prevalence still rising  It's all politics. When you get to politics  nothing makes sense. Elizabeth Pisani   When you get to politics  nothing makes sense.  So  from the point of view of a sex worker  politicians are making no sense. From the point of view of a public health nerd  junkies are doing dumb things. The truth is that everyone has a different rationale. There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet  and that's one of the glories of human existence. But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another  so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician  and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want. But here's the thing  we are the voters. We're not all of them  of course  but TED is a community of opinion leaders. And everyone who's in this room  and everyone who's watching this out there on the web  I think  has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense. It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there  but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV. Thank you. It's not about technology  it's about people and stories. I could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video     Minutes  many of you may have seen it. And it was the now director of the entire piece of the veteran's administration    who  himself  had lost an arm    years ago in Vietnam    who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that don't work. And it turns out that with    Minutes cameras rolling in the background  after he pretty much made his position clear on this    he had his hook and he had his    he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that  quote    his quote    it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in    years. But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story  and I'm not going to show you that polished video. I'm going to  instead  in a minute or two  show you an early  crude video because I think it's a better way to tell a story. A few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DARPA  the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing. They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers. I get this sort of unrequested    by me anyway    visit  and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs DARPA. They proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers  hills of Afghanistan  Iraq ... They were quite proud of the fact that you know  before the dust clears  if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her  they will have brought him back  they will be getting world class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States. That's the good news. The bad news is if they've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm or leg  part of the face  it's probably not coming back. So  they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm. And then the surgeon pointed out  with a lot of anger  he said   Why is it  At the end of the Civil War  they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm  we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it. Now we've got F  s and F  s  and if somebody loses an arm  we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it.  And they basically said   This is unacceptable   and then the punchline   So  Dean  we're here because you make medical stuff. You're going to give us an arm.  And I was waiting for the     pages of bureaucracy  paperwork and DODs. No  the guy says   We're going to bring a guy into this conference room  and wearing the arm you're going to give us  he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table. If it's the grape  they won't break it.  Great he needs efferent  afferent  haptic response sensors.  If it's the raisin  they won't drop it.  So he wants fine motor control  flex at the wrist  flex at the elbow  abduct and flex at the shoulder. Either way they were going to eat it.  Oh  by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a   th percentile female frame    namely    inches from the long finger    and weigh less than nine pounds.    th percentile female frame.  And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power.  So  they finished that. And I  as you can tell  am a bashful guy. I told them they're nuts. They've been watching too much  Terminator.  Then  the surgeon says to me   Dean  you need to know more than two dozen of these kids have come back bilateral.  Now  I cannot imagine    I'm sorry  you may have a better imagination than I do    I can't imagine losing my arm  and typically at    years old. But compared to that  losing two  Seems like that would be an inconvenience. Anyway  I went home that night. I thought about it. I literally could not sleep thinking about   I wonder how you'd roll over with no shoulders.  So  I decided we've got to do this. And trust me  I've got a day job  I've got a lot of day jobs. Most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power .... And I've got a lot of day jobs. But I figured I gotta do this. Did a little investigation  went down to Washington  told them I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it. And I told them I'd build them an arm. I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA  and probably    years to be reasonably functional. Look what it takes to make things like iPods.  Great   he said   You got two years.  I said   I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm that's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year. It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful.  We sort of agreed to disagree. I went back and I started putting a team together  the best guys I could find with a passion to do this. At the end of exactly one year we had a device with    degrees of freedom  all the sensors  all the microprocessors  all the stuff inside. I could show you it with a cosmesis on it that's so real it's eerie  but then you wouldn't see all this cool stuff. I then thought it would be years before we'd be able to make it really  really useful. It turned out  as I think you could see in Aimee's capabilities and attitudes  people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable. Anyway  with less than    hours of use  two guys    one that's bilateral. He's literally  he's got no shoulder on one side  and he's high trans humeral on the other. And that's Chuck and Randy together  after    hours    were playing in our office. And we took some pretty cruddy home movies. At the end of the one I'm going to show  it's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long  Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of  I can't do it. He picks up a spoon  picks it up  scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk  holds the spoon level as he translates it  moving all these joints simultaneously  to his mouth  and he doesn't drop any milk. I cannot do that. His wife was standing behind me. She's standing behind me at the time and she says   Dean  Chuck hasn't fed himself in    years. So  you've got a choice  We keep the arm  or you keep Chuck.  So  can we see that  This is Chuck showing simultaneous control of all the joints. He's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him is our engineer surgeon  which is a convenient guy to have around. There's Randy  these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them. And just as in the spirit of FIRST  gracious professionalism  they are quite proud of this  so they decide to share a drink. This is a non trivial thing to do  by the way. Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it  doing either of those. Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary  at least for my limited physical skill. And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for. He's going to pick up a grape    he didn't drop it  he didn't break it    and he's going to eat it. So  that's where we were at the end of about    months. But  as I've learned from Richard  the technology  the processors  the sensors  the motors  is not the story. I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem or frankly  this whole segment of the medical world. I'll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this. After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design  and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade offs you always make    you can always get three out of four of anything you want  the weight  the size  the cost  the functionality    I put a bunch of guys in my plane and I said   We're flying down to Walter Reed  and we're going talk to these kids  because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm. It doesn't matter whether the Department of Defense likes this arm.  When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic  but I told them   It really doesn't matter what their opinion is. There is only one opinion that matters  the kids that are either going to use it or not.  I told a bunch of my engineers   Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed  and you're going to see people  lots of them  missing major body parts. They're probably going to be angry  depressed  frustrated. We're probably going to have to give them support  encouragement. But we've got to extract from them enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing.  We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong. We did see a bunch of people  a lot of them missing a lot of body parts  and parts they had left were burned  half a face gone  an ear burned off. They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us. And we started asking them all questions.  Look   I'd say to them   We're not quite as good as nature yet. I could give you fine motor control  or I could let you curl    pounds  I probably can't do both. I can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears  or I can give you power  I can't give you both. And we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them. Not only were they enthusiastic  they kept thinking they're there to help us.  Well  would it help if I ...   Guys  and woman  you've given enough. We're here to help you. We need data. We need to know what you need.  After a half an hour  maybe  there was one guy at the far end of the table who wasn't saying much. You could see he was missing an arm. He was leaning on his other arm. I called down to the end   Hey  you haven't said much. If we needed this or this  what would you want   And he said   You know  I'm the lucky guy at this table. I lost my right arm  but I'm a lefty.  So  he wouldn't say much. He had a great spirit  like all the rest of them had great spirits. And he made a few comments. And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys. And that guy pushed himself back from the table ... he has no legs. So  we left. And I was thinking   We didn't give them support and encouragement  they gave it to us. They're not finished giving yet.  It was astounding. So  we went back. And I started working harder  faster. Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center. And we saw lots of these kids  lots of them. And it was astounding how positive they are. So  we went back  and we've been working harder yet. We're in clinical trials  we've got five of them on people. We're screaming along. And I get a call and we go back to Washington. We go back to Walter Reed  and a kid  literally     some odd days before that was blown up. And they shipped him to Germany and    hours later they shipped him from Germany to Walter Reed. And he was there  and they said we needed to come. And I went down and they rolled him into a room. He's got no legs. He's got no arms. He's got a small residual limb on one side. Half of his face is gone  but they said his vision is coming back. He had one good eye. His name is Brandon Marrocco. And he said   I need your arms  but I need two of them.   You'll get them.  This kid was from Staten Island. And he said   I had a truck  before I went over there  and it had a stick. You think I'll be able to drive it    Sure.  And I turned around and went   How are we going to do this   Anyway  he was just like all the rest of them. He doesn't really want a lot. He wants to help. He told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies. So  I was on my way out here. I was asked to stop at Texas. There were       people  the Veteran's Administration  U.S. ... just       at this huge event to help the families of all the kids    some that have died  some that are like Brandon    and they wanted me to speak. I said   What am I going to say  This is not a happy thing. Look  if this happens to you  I can give you ... This stuff is still not as good at the original equipment.   You need to come.  So  I went. And  as I think you get the point  there were a lot people there recovering. Some further along than others. But universally  these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes  and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them. I'll shut up  except one message or concern I have. I don't think anybody does it intentionally  but there were people there literally talking about   Well  how much will they get   You know  this country is involved as we've all heard  in this great healthcare debate.  Who is entitled to what  Who is entitled to how much  Who is going to pay for it   Those are tough questions. I don't have an answer to that. Not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here. It's not possible. It would be nice but let's be realistic. They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there. I don't know the answers. There are other questions that are tough.  Should we be there  How do we get out  What do we need to do   There's very polarized answers to that question too  and I don't have any answers to that. Those are political questions  economic questions  strategic questions. I don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple concern or maybe statement  then. It is an easy answer. I know what these kids deserve on the healthcare side. I was talking to one of them  and he was really liking this arm    it's way  way  way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it    but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got. But I was saying to him   You know  the first airplane went     feet in     . Wilbur and Orville. But you know what  It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous. But now we got Eagles out there  F  s  even that Bald Eagle. I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach  . I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary.  And I said to that kid   I'll stop when your buddies are envious of your Luke arm because of what it can do  and how it does it. And we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working until we do that.  And I think this country ought to continue its great debate  whining and complaining   I'm entitled.   You're a victim.  And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be. But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who's paying for what and how much we get  the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining  I know what they deserve  everything humanly possible. And we ought to give it to them. So  the first robot to talk about is called STriDER. It stands for Self excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot. It's a robot that has three legs  which is inspired by nature. But have you seen anything in nature  an animal that has three legs  Probably not. So  why do I call this a biologically inspired robot  How would it work  But before that  let's look at pop culture. So  you know H.G. Wells'  War of the Worlds   novel and movie. And what you see over here is a very popular video game  and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that are robots that have three legs that terrorize Earth. But my robot  STriDER  does not move like this. So  this is an actual dynamic simulation animation. I'm just going to show you how the robot works. It flips its body     degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall. So  that's how it walks. But when you look at us human being  bipedal walking  what you're doing is you're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot. Right  What you're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall  stand up again  swing your leg and catch the fall. You're using your built in dynamics  the physics of your body  just like a pendulum. We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion. What you're doing is  when you stand up  potential energy to kinetic energy  potential energy to kinetic energy. It's a constantly falling process. So  even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this  really  we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot. Thus it's a biologically inspired robot. What you see over here  this is what we want to do next. We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long range motion. And it deploys legs    it looks almost like  Star Wars     when it lands  it absorbs the shock and starts walking. What you see over here  this yellow thing  this is not a death ray.  Laughter  This is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors    because it is tall  it's  .  meters tall    you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things. So we have two prototypes. The first version  in the back  that's STriDER I. The one in front  the smaller  is STriDER II. The problem that we had with STriDER I is it was just too heavy in the body. We had so many motors  you know  aligning the joints  and those kinds of things. So  we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors  and with a single motor we can coordinate all the motions. It's a mechanical solution to a problem  instead of using mechatronics. So  with this now the top body is light enough. So  it's walking in our lab  this was the very first successful step. It's still not perfected    its coffee falls down    so we still have a lot of work to do. The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS. It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System. So  it's a wheel leg hybrid robot. So  think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel  but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub  so  it's a wheel leg hybrid. We are literally re inventing the wheel here. Let me demonstrate how it works. So  in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach. Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet  it's trying to walk over a changing terrain  a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes. And just by the tactile information  it successfully crosses over these type of terrain. But  when it encounters a very extreme terrain  in this case  this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot  Then it switches to a deliberate mode  where it uses a laser range finder  and camera systems  to identify the obstacle and the size  and it plans  carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility. You probably haven't seen anything like this out there. This is a very high mobility robot that we developed called IMPASS. Ah  isn't that cool  When you drive your car  when you steer your car  you use a method called Ackermann steering. The front wheels rotate like this. For most small wheeled robots  they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turns the opposite direction. For IMPASS  we can do many  many different types of motion. For example  in this case  even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity. We just simply change the length of the spoke. It affects the diameter and then can turn to the left  turn to the right. So  these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with IMPASS. This robot is called CLIMBeR  Cable suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot. So  I've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists    at JPL they are famous for the Mars rovers    and the scientists  geologists always tell me that the real interesting science  the science rich sites  are always at the cliffs. But the current rovers cannot get there. So  inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment. So  this is CLIMBeR. So  what it does  it has three legs. It's probably difficult to see  but it has a winch and a cable at the top    and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot. And then once it figures that out in real time  it calculates the force distribution  how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip. Once it stabilizes that  it lifts a foot  and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing. Also for search and rescue applications as well. Five years ago I actually worked at NASA JPL during the summer as a faculty fellow. And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR. So  this is actually based on that. This robot is called MARS  Multi Appendage Robotic System. So  it's a hexapod robot. We developed our adaptive gait planner. We actually have a very interesting payload on there. The students like to have fun. And here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain. It's trying to walk on the coarse terrain  sandy area  but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand the foot's soil sinkage model changes. So  it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things. And also  it does some fun stuff  as can imagine. We get so many visitors visiting our lab. So  when the visitors come  MARS walks up to the computer  starts typing  Hello  my name is MARS.  Welcome to RoMeLa  the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech. This robot is an amoeba robot. Now  we don't have enough time to go into technical details  I'll just show you some of the experiments. So  this is some of the early feasibility experiments. We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move. Or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward. It's called ChIMERA. We also have been working with some scientists and engineers from UPenn to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot. We do something to something And just like magic  it moves. The blob. This robot is a very recent project. It's called RAPHaEL. Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments. There are a lot of really neat  very good robotic hands out there in the market. The problem is they're just too expensive  tens of thousands of dollars. So  for prosthesis applications it's probably not too practical  because it's not affordable. We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction. Instead of using electrical motors  electromechanical actuators  we're using compressed air. We developed these novel actuators for joints. It is compliant. You can actually change the force  simply just changing the air pressure. And it can actually crush an empty soda can. It can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg  or in this case  a lightbulb. The best part  it took only      dollars to make the first prototype. This robot is actually a family of snake robots that we call HyDRAS  Hyper Degrees of freedom Robotic Articulated Serpentine. This is a robot that can climb structures. This is a HyDRAS's arm. It's a    degrees of freedom robotic arm. But the cool part is the user interface. The cable over there  that's an optical fiber. And this student  probably the first time using it  but she can articulate it many different ways. So  for example in Iraq  you know  the war zone  there is roadside bombs. Currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed. It takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm. In this case it's very intuitive  this student  probably his first time using it  doing very complex manipulation tasks  picking up objects and doing manipulation  just like that. Very intuitive. Now  this robot is currently our star robot. We actually have a fan club for the robot  DARwIn  Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence. As you know  we are very interested in humanoid robot  human walking  so we decided to build a small humanoid robot. This was in       at that time  this was something really  really revolutionary. This was more of a feasibility study  What kind of motors should we use  Is it even possible  What kinds of controls should we do  So  this does not have any sensors. So  it's an open loop control. For those who probably know  if you don't have any sensors and there are any disturbances  you know what happens. So  based on that success  the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics. And thus  DARwIn I was born in     . It stands up  it walks    very impressive. However  still  as you can see  it has a cord  umbilical cord. So  we're still using an external power source and external computation. So  in       now it's really time to have fun. Let's give it intelligence. We give it all the computing power it needs  a  .  gigahertz Pentium M chip  two FireWire cameras  rate gyros  accelerometers  four force sensors on the foot  lithium polymer batteries. And now DARwIn II is completely autonomous. It is not remote controlled. There are no tethers. It looks around  searches for the ball  looks around  searches for the ball  and it tries to play a game of soccer  autonomously  artificial intelligence. Let's see how it does. This was our very first trial  and... Spectators  Video   Goal  Dennis Hong  So  there is actually a competition called RoboCup. I don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup. It's an international autonomous robot soccer competition. And the goal of RoboCup  the actual goal is  by the year      we want to have full size  autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human World Cup champions and win. It's a true actual goal. It's a very ambitious goal  but we truly believe that we can do it. So  this is last year in China. We were the very first team in the United States that qualified in the humanoid RoboCup competition. This is this year in Austria. You're going to see the action  three against three  completely autonomous. There you go. Yes  The robots track and they team play amongst themselves. It's very impressive. It's really a research event packaged in a more exciting competition event. What you see over here  this is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy. So  this is for the best humanoid  and we would like to bring this for the very first time  to the United States next year  so wish us luck. Thank you. DARwIn also has a lot of other talents. Last year it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra for the holiday concert. This is the next generation robot  DARwIn IV  but smarter  faster  stronger. And it's trying to show off its ability   I'm macho  I'm strong. I can also do some Jackie Chan motion  martial art movements.  And it walks away. So  this is DARwIn IV. And again  you'll be able to see it in the lobby. We truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the United States. So  stay tuned. All right. So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work. So  what is the secret of our success  Where do we come up with these ideas  How do we develop these kinds of ideas  We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments. We won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge. We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind. We call it the Blind Driver Challenge  very exciting. And many  many other robotics projects I want to talk about. These are just the awards that we won in      fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things. So  really  we have five secrets. First is  Where do we get inspiration  Where do we get this spark of imagination  This is a true story  my personal story. At night when I go to bed        a.m. in the morning  I lie down  close my eyes  and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around. And they assemble  and they form these kinds of mechanisms. And then I think   Ah this is cool.  So  right next to my bed I keep a notebook  a journal  with a special pen that has a light on it  LED light  because I don't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife. So  I see this  scribble everything down  draw things  and I go to bed. Every day in the morning  the first thing I do before my first cup of coffee  before I brush my teeth  I open my notebook. Many times it's empty  sometimes I have something there    if something's there  sometimes it's junk    but most of the time I can't even read my handwriting. And so    am in the morning  what do you expect  right  So  I need to decipher what I wrote. But sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there  and I have this eureka moment. I directly run to my home office  sit at my computer  I type in the ideas  I sketch things out and I keep a database of ideas. So  when we have these calls for proposals  I try to find a match between my potential ideas and the problem. If there is a match we write a research proposal  get the research funding in  and that's how we start our research programs. But just a spark of imagination is not good enough. How do we develop these kinds of ideas  At our lab RoMeLa  the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory  we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions. So  we gather around  we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it. But before we start we set this golden rule. The rule is  Nobody criticizes anybody's ideas. Nobody criticizes any opinion. This is important  because many times students  they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts. So  once you do this  it is amazing how the students open up. They have these wacky  cool  crazy  brilliant ideas  and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy. And this is how we develop our ideas. Well  we're running out of time. One more thing I want to talk about is  you know  just a spark of idea and development is not good enough. There was a great TED moment  I think it was Sir Ken Robinson  was it  He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity. Well  actually  there are two sides to the story. So  there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition. If you want to go beyond a tinkering  if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that. This is where school comes in. Batman  fighting against bad guys  he has his utility belt  he has his grappling hook  he has all different kinds of gadgets. For us roboticists  engineers and scientists  these tools  these are the courses and classes you take in class. Math  differential equations. I have linear algebra  science  physics  even nowadays  chemistry and biology  as you've seen. These are all the tools that we need. So  the more tools you have  for Batman  more effective at fighting the bad guys  for us  more tools to attack these kinds of big problems. So  education is very important. Also  it's not about that  only about that. You also have to work really  really hard. So  I always tell my students   Work smart  then work hard.  This picture in the back this is   a.m. in the morning. I guarantee if you come to your lab at       am we have students working there  not because I tell them to  but because we are having too much fun. Which leads to the last topic  Do not forget to have fun. That's really the secret of our success  we're having too much fun. I truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun  and that's what we're doing. There you go. Thank you so much. Thank you. I have two missions here today. The first is to tell you something about pollen  I hope  and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose. And  secondly  to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope. Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers. It carries male sex cells from one flower to another. This gives us genetic diversity  or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity. And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself. That's probably true of humans as well  mostly. Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers. Each anther can carry up to         grains of pollen  so  it's quite prolific stuff. And it isn't just bright flowers that have pollen  it's also trees and grasses. And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well. Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen. The little hole in the middle  we'll come to a bit later  but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on. A very tiny tube. So  that's    micrometers across  that pollen grain there. That's about a   th of a millimeter. But not all pollen is quite so simple looking. This is Morina. This is a plant    which I've always thought to be rather tedious    named after Morin  who was an enterprising French gardener  who issued the first seed catalog in     . But anyway  take a look at its pollen. This is amazing  I think. That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube  and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another Morina flower  just on the right species  what happens  Like I said  pollen carries the male sex cells. If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex  they have rampant  promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really. My story is actually not about plant propagation  but about pollen itself.  So  what are pollen's properties   I hear you ask. First of all  pollen is tiny. Yes we know that. It's also very biologically active  as anyone with hay fever will understand. Now  pollen from plants  which are wind dispersed    like trees and grasses and so on    tend to cause the most hay fever. And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species. Here are some examples    they're very smooth if you look at them    of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind. Again    this time  sycamore    wind dispersed. So  trees  very boring flowers  not really trying to attract insects. Cool pollen  though. This one I particularly like. This is the Monterey Pine  which has little air sacks to make the pollen carry even further. Remember  that thing is just about    micrometers across. Now  it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding. This is a bee's leg with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant. And this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm. Very showy  to attract lots of insects to do its bidding. The pollen has little barbs on it  if we look. Now  those little barbs obviously stick to the insects well  but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph  and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this  if it was the Earth. That tells me that it's actually been fossilized  this pollen. And I'm rather proud to say that this was found just near London  and that    million years ago London was full of mangroves. Isn't that cool  Okay  so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects. You can tell that from the little barbs on there. All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope  actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories. No coincidence that these were taken by Rob Kesseler  who is an artist  and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen. Now  all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it came from  and that's actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from. So  different species of plants grow in different places  and some pollen carries further than others. So  if you have a pollen sample  then in principle  you should be able to tell where that sample came from. And this is where it gets interesting for forensics. Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things  and it sticks to them. So  not only does each type of pollen look different  but each habitat has a different combination of plants. A different pollen signature  if you like  or a different pollen fingerprint. By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample  you can tell very precisely where it came from. This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt  similar to the one that I'm wearing now. Now  much of the pollen will still be there after repeated washings. Where has it been  Four very different habitats might look similar  but they've got very different pollen signatures. Actually this one is particularly easy  these pictures were all taken in different countries. But pollen forensics can be very subtle. It's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made  where banknotes have come from  to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did. And murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing  certainly in the U.K.  to within an area that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim. So  you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer or so  where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs. And finally  in a rather grizzly way  the Bosnia war crimes  some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen  which showed that bodies had been buried  exhumed and then reburied somewhere else. I hope I've opened your eyes  if you'll excuse the visual pun   Laughter  to some of pollen's secrets. This is a horse chestnut. There is an invisible beauty all around us  each grain with a story to tell ... each of us  in fact  with a story to tell from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us. Thank you to the colleagues at Kew  and thank you to palynologists everywhere.   My age is three hundred     and seventy two     I think with the deepest regret     How I used to pick up and voraciously chew     the dear little boys that I met     I've eaten them raw in their holiday suits      Eaten them curried with rice      I've eaten them baked in their jackets and boots      And found them exceedingly nice.     But now that my jaws are too weak for such fare      I think it's increasingly rude     To do such a thing when I'm quite well aware     Little boys do not like being chewed.     Little boys do not like being chewed.     So now I contentedly live upon eels      And try to do nothing amiss     And pass all the time I can spare from my meals     In innocent slumber like this      Innocent slumber like this.   I suppose I owe you an explanation. I've been working on a project for the last six years adapting children's poetry to music. And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl  who was a stockbroker in New York City for    years  but in the evenings  he wrote nonsense for his children. And this book was one of the most famous books in America for about    years.  The Sleepy Giant   which is the song that I just sang  is one of his poems. Now  we're going to do other poems for you  and here's a preview of some of the poets. This is Rachel Field  Robert Graves    a very young Robert Graves    Christina Rossetti. Ghosts  right  Have nothing to say to us  obsolete  gone    not so. What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words. Taking them off the dead  flat pages. Bringing them to life  bringing them to light. So  what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane. Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn. When she was    years old in       she published her first book of poems called  The Janitor's Boy.  Here she is. And here's her poem.   Oh  I'm in love with the janitor's boy      And the janitor's boy is in love with me.     Oh  I'm in love with the janitor's boy      And the janitor's boy is in love with me.     He's going to hunt for a desert isle     In our geography.     A desert isle with spicy trees     Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay      A right nice place  just fit for two     Where we can live always.     Oh  I'm in love with the janitor's boy      And the janitor's boy    he's busy as can be      Down in the cellar he's making a raft     Out of an old settee.     He'll carry me off  I know that he will      For his hair is exceedingly red      And the only thing that occurs to me     Is to dutifully shiver in bed.     And on the day that we sail  I will leave a little note     For my parents I hate to annoy       I have flown to an island in the bay     With my janitor's red haired boy.      The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     I'm going to sail away     Gone to Sheepshead Bay     With my janitor's red haired boy.     On an old settee     My red haired boy and me     The janitor's red haired boy.     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy     The janitor's red haired boy   The next poem is by E.E. Cummings   Maggie and Milly and Molly and May.    Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     They went down to the beach one day to play     And Maggie discovered a shell that sang     So sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Milly befriended a stranded star     Whose rays  whose rays     Five languid fingers were     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Maggie and Milly  Molly and May     Molly was chased by a horrible thing     Which raced sideways blowing     Blowing     Blowing     May came home with a smooth  round stone     Small as a world and as large as alone     For whatever we lose like a you or a me     Always ourselves that we find at the sea   Thank you. The next poem is  If No One Ever Marries Me.  It was written by Laurence Alma Tadema. She was the daughter of a very  very famous Dutch painter who had made his fame in England. He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children. One was his daughter  Laurence. She wrote this poem when she was    years old in       and I look at it as kind of a very sweet feminist manifesto tinged with a little bit of defiance and a little bit of resignation and regret.   Well  if no one ever marries me     And I don't see why they should      Nurse says I'm not pretty      And you know I'm seldom good  seldom good        Well  if no one ever marries me     I shan't mind very much      Buy a squirrel in a cage     And a little rabbit hutch.     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     I'll have a cottage near a wood     And a pony all my own     A little lamb quite clean and tame     That I can take to town.     And when I'm really getting old        And    or nine        Buy myself a little orphan girl     And bring her up as mine.     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     If no one marries me     Well  if no one marries me     Marries me     Well  if no one marries me     Marries me     Well  if no one marries me   Thank you. I became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them  and started to research their lives  and then decided to write a book about it. And the burning question about Alma Tadema was  Did she marry  And the answer was no  which I found in the London Times archive. She died alone in      in the company of her books and her dear friends. Gerard Manley Hopkins  a saintly man. He became a Jesuit. He converted from his Anglican faith. He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement  the Oxford Movement  otherwise known as    and he became a Jesuit priest. He burned all his poetry at the age of    and then did not write another poem for at least seven years because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet with the life of a priest. He died typhoid fever at the age of     I believe     or   . At the time  he was teaching classics at Trinity College in Dublin. A few years before he died  after he had resumed writing poetry  but in secret  he confessed to a friend in a letter that I found when I was doing my research   I've written a verse. It is to explain death to a child  and it deserves a piece of plain song music.  And my blood froze when I read that because I had written the plain song music     years after he'd written the letter. And the poem is called   Spring and Fall.    Margaret  are you grieving     Over Goldengrove unleaving  by and by      Leaves  like the things of man  you     With your fresh thoughts care for  can you      But as the heart grows older     It will come to such sights much colder     By and by  nor spare a sigh     Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie      And yet you will weep and you'll know why.     No matter child  the name      Sorrow's springs are all the same     They're all the same.     Nor mouth had nor no mind expressed     What heart heard of  ghost had guessed      It's the blight man was born for      It is Margaret that you mourn for   Thank you so much. I'd like to thank everybody  all the scientists  the philosophers  the architects  the inventors  the biologists  the botanists  the artists ... everyone that blew my mind this week. Thank you.

Curb the enthusiasm  just a little bit. Just bring it down a little.  Laughter  It's my turn. I still have two minutes. Okay  we're going to start that verse again.   Well  you've been so ...   That's innovative  don't you think  Calming the audience down  I'm supposed to be whipping you into a frenzy  and I   That's enough. Sh.   Laughter    Now  you've been kind and ...   I'm going to sing this to Bill Gates.  Laughter  I have so much admiration for him.   Now  you've been so kind and generous      I don't know how you keep on giving.     And for your kindness I'm in debt to you.     And I never could have come this far without you.

Laughter   Clapping    I want to thank you  thank you     Thank you  thank you     Thank you  thank you     Thank you  thank you     I want to thank you  thank you   It works better  right    I want to thank you  thank you     I want to thank you     Ooh hoo     Ooh hoo     Ooh hoo     Ooh hoo   Let's bring it down. Decrescendo. Gradually  bringing it down  bringing it down.   I want to thank you  thank you   Finger popping  ain't no stopping. Thank you so much. Let's pretend right here we have a machine. A big machine  a cool  TED ish machine  and it's a time machine. And everyone in this room has to get into it. And you can go backwards  you can go forwards  you cannot stay where you are. And I wonder what you'd choose  because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back. I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or  American Idol.  I don't know. I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia  to wishful thinking. And I understand that. I'm not part of that crowd  I have to say. I don't want to go back  and it's not because I'm adventurous. It's because possibilities on this planet  they don't go back  they go forward. So I want to get in the machine  and I want to go forward. This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose  health  wealth  mobility  opportunity  declining rates of disease ... There's never been a time like this. My great grandparents died  all of them  by the time they were   . My grandparents pushed that number to   . My parents are closing in on   . So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number. But it's not even about people like us  because this is a bigger deal than that. A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did     years ago. Think about that  it's an incredible fact. And why is it true  Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions of people on this planet. It reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has. It's gone. It's vanished. We vanquished it. Puff. In the rich world  diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist  hardly. Diphtheria  rubella  polio ... does anyone even know what those things are  Vaccines  modern medicine  our ability to feed billions of people  those are triumphs of the scientific method. And to my mind  the scientific method    trying stuff out  seeing if it works  changing it when it doesn't    is one of the great accomplishments of humanity. So that's the good news. Unfortunately  that's all the good news because there are some other problems  and they've been mentioned many times. And one of them is that despite all our accomplishments  a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day. That number's rising  and it's rising really rapidly  and it's disgraceful. And not only that  we've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe. Potable water  arable land  rainforests  oil  gas  they're going away  and they're going away soon  and unless we innovate our way out of this mess  we're going away too. So the question is  Can we do that  And I think we can. I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on. I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it. I really do believe that  and  no  it ain't wishful thinking. But here's the thing that keeps me up at night    one of the things that keeps me up at night  We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never. And we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today. We're on the verge of amazing  amazing events in many fields  and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds      years  before the Enlightenment  to find a time when we battled progress  when we fought about these things more vigorously  on more fronts  than we do now. People wrap themselves in their beliefs  and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free. Not even the truth will set them free. And  listen  everyone's entitled to their opinion  they're even entitled to their opinion about progress. But you know what you're not entitled to  You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry  you're not. And this took me awhile to figure out. About a decade ago  I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker. A little story. And I was amazed to find opposition  opposition to what is  after all  the most effective public health measure in human history. I didn't know what to do  so I just did what I do  I wrote a story and I moved on. And soon after that  I wrote a story about genetically engineered food. Same thing  only bigger. People were going crazy. So I wrote a story about that too  and I couldn't understand why people thought this was  Frankenfoods   why they thought moving molecules around in a specific  rather than a haphazard way  was trespassing on nature's ground. But  you know  I do what I do. I wrote the story  I moved on. I mean  I'm a journalist. We type  we file  we go to dinner. It's fine. But these stories bothered me  and I couldn't figure out why  and eventually I did. And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all. They were thoughtful people  educated people  decent people. They were exactly like the people in this room. And it just disturbed me so much. But then I thought  you know  let's be honest. We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to. We talk about it ambivalently. We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it   progress.  Okay  there are reasons for that  and I think we know what those reasons are. We've lost faith in institutions  in authority  and sometimes in science itself  and there's no reason we shouldn't have. You can just say a few names and people will understand. Chernobyl  Bhopal  the Challenger  Vioxx  weapons of mass destruction  hanging chads. You know  you can choose your list. There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right  so be skeptical. Ask questions  demand proof  demand evidence. Don't take anything for granted. But here's the thing  When you get proof  you need to accept the proof  and we're not that good at doing that. And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one I've never seen and hope never to see again. About    years ago  there was a story published  a horrible story  that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles  mumps and rubella vaccine shot. Very scary. Tons of studies were done to see if this was true. Tons of studies should have been done  it's a serious issue. The data came back. The data came back from the United States  from England  from Sweden  from Canada  and it was all the same  no correlation  no connection  none at all. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes  we believe what we see  what we think we see  what makes us feel real. We don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data  and I do understand that  I think we all do. But you know what  The result of that has been disastrous. Disastrous because here's a fact  The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down. That is disgraceful  and we should be ashamed of ourselves. It's horrible. What kind of a thing happened that we could do that  Now  I understand it. I do understand it. Because  did anyone have measles here  Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles  Doesn't happen very much. Doesn't happen in this country at all  but it happened         times in the world last year. That's a lot of death of measles       an hour. But since it didn't happen here  we can put it out of our minds  and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like  Oprah  and  Larry King Live.  And they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation. They don't understand that these things seem the same  but they're almost never the same. And it's something we need to learn  and we need to learn it really soon. This guy was a hero  Jonas Salk. He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us. No fear  no agony. Polio    puff  gone. That guy in the middle  not so much. His name is Paul Offit. He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people. It'll save the lives of     to         kids in the developing world every year. Pretty good  right  Well  it's good  except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining. And he actually says it that way. So  Paul's a terrorist. When Paul speaks in a public hearing  he can't testify without armed guards. He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school. And why  Because Paul made a vaccine. I don't need to say this  but vaccines are essential. You take them away  disease comes back  horrible diseases. And that's happening. We have measles in this country now. And it's getting worse  and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game. And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio  Let's have that. Why not  A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident. No one's ever said that before. She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio  no way. Fine. Why  Because we don't have polio. And you know what  We didn't have polio in this country yesterday. Today  I don't know  maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning  and he's flying to LAX  right now he's over Ohio. And he's going to land in a couple of hours  he's going to rent a car  and he's going to come to Long Beach  and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight. And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease  and we don't either because that's the way the world works. That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't. Now  we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it. Everyone take their vitamins this morning  Echinacea  a little antioxidant to get you going. I know you did because half of Americans do every day. They take the stuff  and they take alternative medicines  and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're useless. The data says it all the time. They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that. It's okay  you want to pay    billion dollars for dark urine  I'm totally with you. Dark urine. Dark. Why do we do that  Why do we do that  Well  I think I understand  we hate Big Pharma. We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man. And we shouldn't  Our health care system sucks. It's cruel to millions of people. It's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul bending to those of us who can even afford it. So we run away from it  and where do we run  We leap into the arms of Big Placebo. That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo. But  you know  it's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap  and we spend billions of dollars on it. And I have all sorts of little props here. None of it ... ginkgo  fraud  echinacea  fraud  acai    I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it    it's fraud. And you know what  When I say this stuff  people scream at me  and they say   What do you care  Let people do what they want to do. It makes them feel good.  And you know what  You're wrong. Because I don't care if it's the secretary of HHS who's saying   Hmm  I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms   or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas. When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science  you end up in a place you don't want to be. You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa. He killed         of his people by insisting that beetroot  garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS. Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease. Please  don't tell me there are no consequences to these things. There are. There always are. Now  the most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite. It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop. It's a debate about words  about metaphors. It's ideology  it's not science. Every single thing we eat  every grain of rice  every sprig of parsley  every Brussels sprout has been modified by man. You know  there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden. There wasn't any cantaloupe.  Laughter  There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all. We made it over the last        years. And some of it worked  and some of it didn't. We got rid of the stuff that didn't. Now we can do it in a more precise way    and there are risks  absolutely    but we can put something like vitamin A into rice  and that stuff can help millions of people  millions of people  prolong their lives. You don't want to do that  I have to say  I don't understand it. We object to genetically engineered food. Why do we do that  Well  the things I constantly hear are  Too many chemicals  pesticides  hormones  monoculture  we don't want giant fields of the same thing  that's wrong. We don't companies patenting life. We don't want companies owning seeds. And you know what my response to all of that is  Yes  you're right. Let's fix it. It's true  we've got a huge food problem  but this isn't science. This has nothing to do with science. It's law  it's morality  it's patent stuff. You know science isn't a company. It's not a country. It's not even an idea  it's a process. It's a process  and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't  but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid  is really very deadening  and it's preventing millions of people from prospering. You know  in the next    years we're going to have to grow    percent more food than we do right now     percent. This investment in Africa over the last    years. Disgraceful. Disgraceful. They need it  and we're not giving it to them. And why  Genetically engineered food. We don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff  like cassava for instance. Cassava's something that half a billion people eat. It's kind of like a potato. It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks. It doesn't have nutrients  it doesn't have protein  and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now. And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind. They wouldn't starve  and you know what  That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse  but it would be nice. And all I can say about this is  Why are we fighting it  I mean  let's ask ourselves  Why are we fighting it  Because we don't want to move genes around  This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals. It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones  our insistence on having bigger food  better food  singular food. This isn't about Rice Krispies  this is about keeping people alive  and it's about time we started to understand what that meant. Because  you know something  If we don't  if we continue to act the way we're acting  we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of  high tech colonialism. There's no other way to describe what's going on here. It's selfish  it's ugly  it's beneath us  and we really have to stop it. So after this amazingly fun conversation  you might want to say   So  you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward   Absolutely. Absolutely  I do. It's stuck in the present right now  but we have an amazing opportunity. We can set that time machine on anything we want. We can move it where we want to move it  and we're going to move it where we want to move it. We have to have these conversations and we have to think  but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead  we're going to be happy we do. I know that we can  and as far as I'm concerned  that's something the world needs right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In my industry  we believe that images can change the world. Okay  we're naive  we're bright eyed and bushy tailed. The truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world  but we're also aware that  since the beginning of photography  images have provoked reactions in people  and those reactions have caused change to happen. So let's begin with a group of images. I'd be extremely surprised if you didn't recognize many or most of them. They're best described as iconic  so iconic  perhaps  they're cliches. In fact  they're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form. But I think we're looking for something more. We're looking for something more. We're looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues  images that transcend borders  that transcend religions  images that provoke us to step up and do something    in other words  to act. Well  this image you've all seen. It changed our view of the physical world. We had never seen our planet from this perspective before. Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time    its smallness  its fragility. Forty years later  this group  more than most  are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment. And at last  we appear to be doing something about it. This destructive power takes many different forms. For example  these images taken by Brent Stirton in the Congo. These gorillas were murdered  some would even say crucified  and unsurprisingly  they sparked international outrage. Most recently  we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti. Well  I think what is far worse is man's destructive power over man. Samuel Pisar  an Auschwitz survivor  said  and I'll quote him   The Holocaust teaches us that nature  even in its cruelest moments  is benign in comparison with man  when he loses his moral compass and his reason.  There's another kind of crucifixion. The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact. The publication of those images  as opposed to the images themselves  caused a government to change its policies. Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act. Furthermore  those images forever removed the so called moral high ground of the occupying forces. Let's go back a little. In the     s and     s  the Vietnam War was basically shown in America's living rooms day in  day out. News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war  a little girl burned by napalm  a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest. In fact  these images became the voices of protest themselves. Now  images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion  ignorance  and in particular    I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image    the issue of HIV AIDS. In the     s  the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it. A simple act  in       of the most famous woman in the world  the Princess of Wales  touching an HIV AIDS infected baby did a great deal  especially in Europe  to stop that. She  better than most  knew the power of an image. So when we are confronted by a powerful image  we all have a choice  We can look away  or we can address the image. Thankfully  when these photos appeared in The Guardian in       they put a lot of focus and attention and  in the end  a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts. Did the images change the world  No  but they had a major impact. Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other. We all saw those images after Katrina  and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact. And I think it's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November     . Unfortunately  some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them. I'll show you one photo here  and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work  which has never been published  called War Is Personal. But images don't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war. John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery. After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world  there's one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still  much more than the others. Ansel Adams said  and I'm going to disagree with him   You don't take a photograph  you make it.  In my view  it's not the photographer who makes the photo  it's you. We bring to each image our own values  our own belief systems  and as a result of that  the image resonates with us. My company has    million images. I have one image in my office. Here it is. I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you  you'll better understand why  and I know that speaking to this audience  you'll definitely do something about it. And thank you to all the photographers. First of all  I'm a geek. I'm an organic food eating  carbon footprint minimizing  robotic surgery geek. And I really want to build green  but I'm very suspicious of all of these well meaning articles  people long on moral authority and short on data  telling me how to do these kinds of things. And so I have to figure this out for myself. For example  Is this evil  I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self actualized local cows on my counter top  and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up. But can I use a paper towel   Laughter  The answer to this can be found in embodied energy. This is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water  and every time I use a paper towel  I am using this much virtual energy and water. Wipe it up  throw it away. Now  if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times  I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy until I wash that yogurty towel. This is now operating energy. So if I throw my towel in the washing machine  I've now put energy and water back into that towel ... unless I use a front loading  high efficiency washing machine   Laughter  and then it looks a little bit better. But what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets  Well  now a paper towel looks better. Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge. I wipe it up with a sponge  and I put it under the running water  and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water. Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on  and then you start to use more energy. Or worse  you let it run until it's warm to rinse out your towel. And now all bets are off. So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect    the position in which you put the handle    have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize. Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house. That's what my husband and I are doing right now. And so  we wanted to know  how green could we be  And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade offs. And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room. Now  the average house has about     megawatt hours of embodied energy in it  this is the energy it takes to make it    millions and millions of paper towels. We wanted to know how much better we could do. And so  like many people  we start with a house on a lot  and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom. So first  we demolish it. It takes some energy  but if you deconstruct it    you take it all apart  you use the bits    you can get some of that energy back. We then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent. And then we poured a big foundation for passive solar. Now  you can reduce the embodied energy by about    percent by using high fly ash concrete. We then put in framing. And so this is framing    lumber  composite materials    and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that  but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC certified lumber. We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising. If we put aluminum windows in this house  we would double the energy use right there. Now  PVC is a little bit better  but still not as good as the wood that we chose. We then put in plumbing  electrical and HVAC  and insulate. Now  spray foam is an excellent insulator    it fills in all the cracks    but it is pretty high embodied energy  and  sprayed in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that. We also used straw bale infill for our library  which has zero embodied energy. When it comes time to sheetrock  if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock. And then you get to the finishes  the subject of all of those  go green  articles  and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all. And yet  all the press is focused on that. Except for flooring. If you put carpeting in your house  it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house  unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy. So now we add in the final construction energy  we add it all up  and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this. But before we pat ourselves too much on the back  we have poured     megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before. And so the question is  How could we make that back  And so if I run my new energy efficient house forward  compared with the old  non energy efficient house  we make it back in about six years. Now  I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy efficient  and in that case  it would take me more about    years to break even. Now  if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy  it would have taken us over    years to break even compared to the upgraded house. So what does this mean  On the scale of my portion of the house  this is equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year  it's about five times as much as if I went entirely vegetarian. But my elephant in the living room flies. Clearly  I need to walk home from TED. But all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog. And  remember  it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are. Thank you.  Applause  The brilliant playwright  Adrienne Kennedy  wrote a volume called  People Who Led to My Plays.  And if I were to write a volume  it would be called   Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions  because my work  in understanding art and in understanding culture  has come by following artists  by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are. J.J. from  Good Times   significant to many people of course because of  Dy no mite   but perhaps more significant as the first  really  black artist on primetime TV. Jean Michel Basquiat  important to me because  he was  the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into. My overall project is about art    specifically  about black artists    very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves. My interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history  who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art  but who have created new places for us to see and understand. I'm showing two artists here   Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker  two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world. I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create a new story  a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world. And to do this  I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work  understand the artist's studio as a laboratory  imagine  then  reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper    asking questions  providing the space to look and to think about answers. In       when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum  I made an exhibition called Black Male. It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art. It sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for dialogue    complicated dialogue  dialogue with many  many points of entry    and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas. This exhibition included over    artists of various ages and races  but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view. What was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator  as a catalyst  for this dialogue. One of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding  of themselves and each other. I'm showing you two works  one on the right by Leon Golub  one on the left by Robert Colescott. And in the course of the exhibition    which was contentious  controversial and ultimately  for me  life changing in my sense of what art could be    a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other. And she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was  as it related  for her  to the idea of how black people had been represented. And she pointed to the image on the right as an example  to me  of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media. She then assigned these works racial identities  basically saying to me that the work on the right  clearly  was made by a black artist  the work on the left  clearly  by a white artist  when  in effect  that was the opposite case  Bob Colescott  African American artist  Leon Golub  a white artist. The point of that for me was to say    in that space  in that moment    that I really  more than anything  wanted to understand how images could work  how images did work  and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day to day lives to work through these images. Fast forward and I end up in Harlem  home for many of black America  very much the psychic heart of the black experience  really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed. Harlem now  sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century  looking both backwards and forwards ... I always say Harlem is an interesting community because  unlike many other places  it thinks of itself in the past  present and the future simultaneously  no one speaks of it just in the now. It's always what it was and what it can be. And  in thinking about that  then my second project  the second question I ask is  Can a museum be a catalyst in a community  Can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves  This is Harlem  actually  on January   th  thinking about itself in a very wonderful way. So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem  thinking about exhibitions there  thinking about what it means to discover art's possibility. Now  what does this mean to some of you  In some cases  I know that many of you are involved in cross cultural dialogues  you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation. Think about the place that artists can play in that    that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards  in working with young  black artists. Think about artists  not as content providers  though they can be brilliant at that  but  again  as real catalysts. The Studio Museum was founded in the late   s. And I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history. To look at       in the incredible historic moment that it is  and think of the arc that has happened since then  to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the legacy of important African American artists to the history of art in this country like Jacob Lawrence  Norman Lewis  Romare Bearden. And then  of course  to bring us to today. In       Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University. After his lecture  a student got up and said to him   Give us a poem.  And Mohammed Ali said   Me  we.  A profound statement about the individual and the community. The space in which now  in my project of discovery  of thinking about artists  of trying to define what might be black art cultural movement of the   st century. What that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment  the  me  we  seems incredibly prescient totally important. To this end  the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions  all titled with an F    Freestyle  Frequency and Flow    which have set out to discover and define the young  black artists working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years. This series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now  at this point in history  to see art as a catalyst  what it means now  at this point in history  as we define and redefine culture  black culture specifically in my case  but culture generally. I named this group of artists around an idea  which I put out there called post black  really meant to define them as artists who came and start their work now  looking back at history but start in this moment  historically. It is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking. This new set of questions is  What does it mean  right now  to be African American in America  What can artwork say about this  Where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation  Really  most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring. Their works for me are about  not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine  that their visions create and put out there in the world  but more  perhaps  importantly  through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation  as well as in the future. I am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be. I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work. It is why I look to art. It's why I ask questions of art. It is why I make exhibitions. Now  this exhibition  as I said     young artists done over the course of eight years  and for me it's about considering the implications. It's considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us. It's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels  but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us. It's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it  and imagining  particularly in urban America  about the nurturing of the spirit. Now  where  perhaps  does this end up right now  For me  it is about re imagining this cultural discourse in an international context. So the last iteration of this project has been called Flow  with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world  really looking  not so much from Harlem and out  but looking across  and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa. And as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the   st century  I have begun that looking through artists  through artworks  and imagining what they can tell us about the future  what they tell us about our future  and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue. So  what do I discover when I look at artworks  What do I think about when I think about art  I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works  the discovery of exciting works. But  really  it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition  to talk about beauty  to talk about power  to talk about ourselves  and to talk and speak to each other. That's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world. Thank you.  Applause  In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau  who said   People protect what they love   I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean  and that's the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make light. My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp  that's not an acronym    just somebody thought it looked like the insect. It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of       feet. Right after I completed my Ph.D.  I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration. We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme  and then my first open ocean dive was in Santa Barbara Channel. It was an evening dive. I went down to a depth of     feet and turned out the lights. And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence. But I was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was. I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores that were longer than this room  pumping out so much light that I could read the dials and gauges inside the suit without a flashlight  and puffs and billows of what looked like luminous blue smoke  and explosions of sparks that would swirl up out of the thrusters    just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire  but these were icy  blue embers. It was breathtaking. Now  usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all  it's these guys  it's fireflies. And there are a few other land dwellers that can make light    some insects  earthworms  fungi    but in general  on land  it's really rare. In the ocean  it's the rule rather than the exception. If I go out in the open ocean environment  virtually anywhere in the world  and I drag a net from       feet to the surface  most of the animals    in fact  in many places     to    percent of the animals that I bring up in that net    make light. This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows. Now I want to share with you a little video that I shot from a submersible. I first developed this technique working from a little single person submersible called Deep Rover and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea Link  which you see here. So  mounted in front of the observation sphere  there's a a three foot diameter hoop with a screen stretched across it. And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that's about as sensitive as a fully dark adapted human eye  albeit a little fuzzy. So you turn on the camera  turn out the lights. That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence  that's just electronic noise on these super intensified cameras. You don't see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water  but as it does  animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesce. Now  when I was first doing this  all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources. I knew my forward speed  I knew the area  and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter. But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced. And so  here  in the Gulf of Maine at     feet  I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level. Like those big explosions  sparks  are from a little comb jelly  and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans  and jellyfish. There was another one of those comb jellies. And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point. And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land  and do nearest neighbor distances. But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this. You can actually see it in surface waters. This is some shot  by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution  of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton. And this isn't someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico  this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor. And sometimes you can see it even closer than that  because the heads on ships    that's toilets  for any land lovers that are listening    are flushed with unfiltered seawater that often has bioluminescent plankton in it. So  if you stagger into the head late at night and you're so toilet hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light  you may think that you're having a religious experience.  Laughter  So  how does a living creature make light  Well  that was the question that   th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois  asked about this bioluminescent clam. He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals  one  the enzyme  he called luciferase  the substrate  he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer. That terminology has stuck  but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms. In fact  most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry  because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing antibacterial agents  cancer fighting drugs  testing for the presence of life on Mars  detecting pollutants in our waters    which is how we use it at ORCA. In       the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish  and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope  in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering. Another thing all these molecules are telling us that  apparently  bioluminescence has evolved at least    times  maybe as many as    separate times in evolutionary history  which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival. So  what is it about bioluminescence that's so important to so many animals  Well  for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness  light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive  and that's find food  attract a mate and avoid being eaten. So  for example  this fish has a built in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate. And then when it's not using it  it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini. This fish actually has high beams. And this fish  which is one of my favorites  has three headlights on each side of its head. Now  this one is blue  and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication. So  most animals make blue light  and most animals can only see blue light  but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs. And I have no idea why there's two  and that's something I want to solve some day    but not only can it see blue light  but it can see red light. So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen. It's also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off. And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure. This is another one of my favorite fish. This is a viperfish  and it's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name. The teeth on this fish are so long that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish  it would actually impale its own brain. So instead  it slides in grooves on the outside of the head. This is a Christmas tree of a fish  everything on this fish lights up  it's not just that lure. It's got a built in flashlight. It's got these jewel like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its shadow  so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below  it makes itself disappear. It's got light organs in the mouth  it's got light organs in every single scale  in the fins  in a mucus layer on the back and the belly  all used for different things    some of which we know about  some of which we don't. And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar  and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing my favorite topic with so many people. I do wish  with their budget  that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor  starving graduate student  who could have told them that those are the eyes of a fish that's been preserved in formalin. These are the eyes of a living anglerfish. So  she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey. And this one has a lure with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it. Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey  but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists  or more likely their graduate students  have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing. So  now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world  because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males. This little guy has no visible means of self support. He has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there. His only hope for existence on this planet is as a gigolo.  Laughter  He's got to find himself a babe and then he's got to latch on for life. So this little guy has found himself this babe  and you will note that he's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her. But he still knows a good thing when he sees it  and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss. His flesh fuses with her flesh  her bloodstream grows into his body  and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac. Well  this is a deep sea version of Women's Lib. She always knows where he is  and she doesn't have to be monogamous  because some of these females come up with multiple males attached. So they can use it for finding food  for attracting mates. They use it a lot for defense  many different ways. A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud. This shrimp is actually spewing light out of its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness. And there are a lot of different animals that can do this  There's jellyfish  there's squid  there's a whole lot of different crustaceans  there's even fish that can do this. This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light. And I was luck enough to capture one of these when we were on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of Africa for  Blue Planet   for the deep portion of  Blue Planet.  And we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive. So we captured one of these  and I brought it into the lab. So I'm holding it  and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder  and when I do  you'll see bioluminescence coming out. But to me  what's shocking is not just the amount of light  but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase. For this fish  it's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes. It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this  and we have no idea why it does it    another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved. Now  another form of defense is something called a burglar alarm    same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car  the honking horn and flashing lights are meant to attract the attention of  hopefully  the police that will come and take the burglar away    when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator  its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier that will attack their attacker  thereby affording them a chance for escape. This jellyfish  for example  has a spectacular bioluminescent display. This is us chasing it in the submersible. That's not luminescence  that's reflected light from the gonads. We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition  bring it into the lab on the ship. And then to generate the display you're about to see  all I did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish. And once this display gets going  I'm not touching it anymore. This is an unbelievable light show. It's this pinwheel of light  and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen from as much as     feet away by a predator. And I thought   You know  that might actually make a pretty good lure.  Because one of the things that's frustrated me as a deep sea explorer is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean. The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean is we go out and drag nets behind ships. And I defy you to name any other branch of science that still depends on hundreds of year old technology. The other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote operated vehicles. I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles. When I'm sitting in a submersible though  I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all    I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters    any animal with any sense is going to be long gone. So  I've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore. And so  sometime ago  I got this idea for a camera system. It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye in the Sea. And scientists have done this on land for years  we just use a color that the animals can't see and then a camera that can see that color. You can't use infrared in the sea. We use far red light  but even that's a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly. Made an intensified camera  wanted to make this electronic jellyfish. Thing is  in science  you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover before they'll give you the money. And I didn't know what I was going to discover  so I couldn't get the funding for this. So I kluged this together  I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially  and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources. Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute gave me time with their ROV so that I could test it and we could figure out  you know  for example  which colors of red light we had to use so that we could see the animals  but they couldn't see us    get the electronic jellyfish working. And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was  because we cast these    blue LEDs in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used  the word Ziploc is still visible. Needless to say  when it's kluged together like this  there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working. But there came a moment when it all came together  and everything worked. And  remarkably  that moment got caught on film by photographer Mark Richards  who happened to be there at the precise moment that we discovered that it all came together. That's me on the left  my graduate student at the time  Erika Raymond  and Lee Fry  who was the engineer on the project. And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption   Engineer satisfying two women at once.   Laughter  And we were very  very happy. So now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators. And so  the place that we took it to was this place called a Brine Pool  which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico. It's a magical place. And I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you    we had a crummy camera at the time    but I was ecstatic. We're at the edge of the Brine Pool  there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera. It's clearly undisturbed by us. And I had my window into the deep sea. I  for the first time  could see what animals were doing down there when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way. Four hours into the deployment  we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time. Eighty six seconds after it went into its pinwheel display  we recorded this  This is a squid  over six feet long  that is so new to science  it cannot be placed in any known scientific family. I could not have asked for a better proof of concept. And based on this  I went back to the National Science Foundation and said   This is what we will discover.  And they gave me enough money to do it right  which has involved developing the world's first deep sea webcam    which has been installed in the Monterey Canyon for the past year    and now  more recently  a modular form of this system  a much more mobile form that's a lot easier to launch and recover  that I hope can be used on Sylvia's  hope spots  to help explore and protect these areas  and  for me  learn more about the bioluminescence in these  hope spots.  So one of these take home messages here is  there is still a lot to explore in the oceans. And Sylvia has said that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them  and she's right. So if you ever  ever get an opportunity to take a dive in a submersible  say yes    a thousand times  yes    and please turn out the lights. I promise  you'll love it. Thank you. Good morning. Happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces. I have a very peculiar background  attitude and approach to the real world because I am a conjurer. Now  I prefer that term over magician  because if I were a magician  that would mean that I use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic. No  I don't do that  I'm a conjurer  who is someone who pretends to be a real magician.  Laughter  Now  how do we go about that sort of thing  We depend on the fact that audiences  such as yourselves  will make assumptions. For example  when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on  you assumed this was a microphone  which it is not. As a matter of fact  this is something that about half of you  more than half of you will not be familiar with. It's a beard trimmer  you see  And it makes a very bad microphone  I've tried it many times.  Laughter  The other assumption that you made    and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions. Not only that you can  but that you will when they are properly suggested to you. You believe I'm looking at you. Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you. I know you're out there  they told me backstage  it's a full house and such. I know you're there because I can hear you  but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses. These are not glasses  these are empty frames.  Laughter  Quite empty frames. Now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face  To fool you  ladies and gentlemen  to deceive you  to show that you  too  can make assumptions. Don't you ever forget that. Now  I have to do something    first of all  switch to real glasses so I can actually see you  which would probably be a convenience. I don't know. I haven't had a good look. Well  it's not that great a convenience. I have to do something now  which seems a little bit strange for a magician. But I'm going to take some medication. This is a full bottle of Calms Forte. I'll explain that in just a moment. Ignore the instructions  that's what the government has to put in there to confuse you  I'm sure. I will take enough of these. Mm. Indeed  the whole container. Thirty two tablets of Calms Forte. Now that I've done that    I'll explain it in a moment    I must tell you that I am an actor. I'm an actor who plays a specific part. I play the part of a magician  a wizard  if you will  a real wizard. If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet  you would be insulted and rightly so. Why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this  But there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic  magical powers that they can predict the future  that they can make contact with the deceased. Oh  they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods. Oh  they gladly sell you that  yes. And they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems. They claim to be psychics  or sensitives  whatever they can. But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead. Now  to my innocent mind  dead implies incapable of communicating.  Laughter  You might agree with me on that. But these people  they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead     Hi  there     but they can hear the dead as well  and they can relay this information back to the living. I wonder if that's true. I don't think so  because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do  exactly the same    the same physical methods  the same psychological methods    and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth  to their detriment. They deceive these people  costs them a lot of money  cost them a lot of emotional anguish. Billions of dollars are spent every year  all over the globe  on these charlatans. Now  I have two questions I would like to ask these people if I had the opportunity to do so. First question  If I want to ask them to call up    because they do hear them through the ear. They listen to the spirits like this    I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because  when she died  she had the family will  and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is  so we ask Granny   Where is the will  Granny   What does Granny say  She says   I'm in heaven and it's wonderful. I'm here with all my old friends  my deceased friends  and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl. And I love you  and I'll always be with you. Good bye.  And she didn't answer the damn question  Where is the will  Now  she could easily have said   Oh  it's in the library on the second shelf  behind the encyclopedia   but she doesn't say that. No  she doesn't. She doesn't bring any useful information to us. We paid a lot of money for that information  be we didn't get it. The second question that I'd like to ask  rather simple  Suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father in law  as an example. Why do they insist on saying    remember  they speak into this ear    why do they say   My name starts with J or M   Is this a hunting game  Hunting and fishing  What is it  Is it    questions  No  it's more like     questions. But it is a cruel  vicious  absolutely conscienceless    I'll be all right  keep your seats  Laughter     game that these people play. And they take advantage of the innocent  the naive  the grieving  the needy people out there. Now  this is a process that is called cold reading. There's one fellow out there  Van Praagh is his name  James Van Praagh. He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing. John Edward  Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea  they are other operators. There are hundreds of them all over the earth  but in this country  James Van Praagh is very big. And what does he do  He likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased  the people he's talking to through his ear  you see  So what he says is  very often  is like this  he says   He tells me  he tells me  before he passed  that he had trouble breathing.  Folks  that's what dying is all about  You stop breathing  and then you're dead. It's that simple. And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you  I don't think so. Now  these people will make guesses  they'll say things like   Why am I getting electricity  He's saying to me  'Electricity.' Was he an electrician    No.   Did he ever have an electric razor    No.  It was a game of hunting questions like this. This is what they go through. Now  folks often ask us at the James Randi Educational Foundation  they call me  they say   Why are you so concerned about this  Mr. Randi  Isn't it just a lot of fun   No  it is not fun. It is a cruel farce. Now  it may bring a certain amount of comfort  but that comfort lasts only about    minutes or so. And then the people look in the mirror  and they say  I just paid a lot of money for that reading. And what did she say to me  'I love you '  They always say that. They don't get any information  they don't get any value for what they spend. Now  Sylvia Browne is the big operator. We call her  The Talons.  Sylvia Browne    thank you    Sylvia Browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment. Now  Sylvia Browne    just to show you    she actually gets     dollars for a    minute reading over the telephone  she doesn't even go there in person  and you have to wait up to two years because she's booked ahead that amount of time. You pay by credit card or whatever  and then she will call you sometime in the next two years. You can tell it's her.  Hello  this is Sylvia Browne.  That's her  you can tell right away. Now  Montel Williams is an intelligent man. We all know who he is on television. He's well educated  he's smart  he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn. He just doesn't care. Because  the bottom line is  the sponsors love it  and he will expose her to television publicity all the time. Now  what does Sylvia Browne give you for that     dollars  She gives you the names of your guardian angels  that's first. Now  without that  how could we possibly function   Laughter  She gives you the names of previous lives  who you were in previous lives. Duh. It turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all Babylonian princesses  or something like that. And the men were all Grecian warriors fighting with Agamemnon. Nothing is ever said about a    year old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption. He isn't worth bringing back  obviously. And the strange thing    folks  you may have noticed this too. You see these folks on television    they never call anybody back from hell.  Laughter  Everyone comes back from heaven  but never from hell. If they call back any of my friends  they're not going to... Well  you see the story. Now  Sylvia Browne is an exception  an exception in one way  because the James Randi Educational Foundation  my foundation  offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds. Very simply won. All you have to do is prove any paranormal  occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions. It's very easy  win the million dollars. Sylvia Browne is an exception in that she's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge. She did this on the  Larry King Live  show on CNN six and a half years ago. And we haven't heard from her since. Strange. She said that  first of all  that she didn't know how to contact me. Duh. A professional psychic who speaks to dead people  she can't reach me  I'm alive  you may have noticed. Well  pretty well anyway. She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me because I'm a godless person. All the more reason to take the million dollars  wouldn't you think  Sylvia  Now these people need to be stopped  seriously now. They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce. We get people coming to the foundation all the time. They're ruined financially and emotionally because they've given their money and their faith to these people. Now  I popped some pills earlier. I have to explain that to you. Homeopathy  let's find out what that's all about. Hmm. You've heard of it. It's an alternative form of healing  right  Homeopathy actually consists    and that's what this is. This is Calms Forte     caplets of sleeping pills  I forgot to tell you that. I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills. Six and a half days  that certainly is a fatal dose. It says right on the back here   In case of overdose  contact your poison control center immediately   and it gives an     number. Keep your seats    it's going to be okay. I don't really need it because I've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world for the last eight or    years  taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills. Why don't they affect me  The answer may surprise you. What is homeopathy  It's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond Avogadro's limit. Diluting it down to the point where there's none of it left.  Laughter  Now folks  this is not just a metaphor I'm going to give you now  it's true. It's exactly equivalent to taking one     milligram aspirin tablet  throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe  and then stirring it up  obviously with a very big stick  and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous. Then  when you get a headache  you take a sip of this water  and    voila     it is gone. Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about. And another claim that they make    you'll love this one    the more dilute the medicine is  they say  the more powerful it is. Now wait a minute  we heard about a guy in Florida. The poor man  he was on homeopathic medicine. He died of an overdose. He forgot to take his pill. Work on it. Work on it. It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what we're doing  believing in all this nonsense over all these years. Now  let me tell you  The James Randi Educational Foundation is waving this very big carrot  but I must say  the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn't mean that the powers don't exist. They might  some place out there. Maybe these people are just independently wealthy. Well  with Sylvia Browne I would think so. You know      dollars for a    minute reading over the telephone    that's more than lawyers make  I mean that's a fabulous amount of money. These people don't need the million dollars perhaps  but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it just to make me look silly  Just to get rid of this godless person out there that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time  I think that something needs to be done about this. We really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal  state and local authorities to get them to do something. If you find out    now I understand. We've seen people  even today  speaking to us about AIDS epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with. Those are very important  critically important to us. And we must do something about those problems. But at the same time  as Arthur C. Clarke said  The rotting of the human mind  the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural    all of this total nonsense  this medieval thinking    I think something should be done about that  and it all lies in education. Largely  it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing. They shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors. It's the bottom line  the dollar line. That's what they're looking at. We really must do something about this. I'm willing to take your suggestions  and I'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage. It's www.randi.org. Go in there and look at the archives  and you will begin to understand much more of what I've been talking about today. You will see the records that we have. There's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune. She cashed in the CDs  she gave away the stocks and the certificates. That's really sad to hear  and it hasn't helped them one bit  hasn't solved any of their problems. Yes  there could be a rotting of the American mind  and of the minds all the way around the earth  if we don't start to think sensibly about these things. Now  we've offered this carrot  as I say  we've dangled the carrot. We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it. Oh  we get lots of them  hundreds of them every year come by. These are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well  but they're amateurs  they don't know how to evaluate their own so called powers. The professionals never come near us  except in that case of Sylvia Browne that I told you about a moment ago. She did accept and then backed away. Ladies and gentlemen  I'm James Randi  and I'm waiting. Thank you. The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden. If we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest  we see that Sub Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV AIDS. This is the most devastating epidemic of our time. We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease. There are very few doctors and  quite frankly  these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics. So what the Western countries  developed countries  have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications. And this has already saved millions of lives  and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub Saharan Africa. But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease  because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services  you end up creating a problem of drug resistance. This is already beginning to happen in Sub Saharan Africa. The problem is that  what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem. And the last thing we want to see is drug resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world  because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre ARV carnage of HIV AIDS. I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda. This was in the   s during the peak of the HIV epidemic  before there were any ARVs in Sub Saharan Africa. And during that time  I actually lost more relatives  as well as the teachers who taught me  to HIV AIDS. So this became one of the driving passions of my life  to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems. We all know about the miracle of miniaturization. Back in the day  computers used to fill this entire room  and people actually used to work inside the computers. But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone. And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world  in the Third World countries. The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories. So  right now  we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips. I was very lucky to come to the US right after high school  and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices. This is a microfluidic chip that I developed. A close look at how the technology works  These are channels that are about the size of a human hair    so you have integrated valves  pumps  mixers and injectors    so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system. So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system. So  with one microfluidic chip  which is the size of an iPhone  you can actually diagnose     patients at the same time. For each patient  we will be able to do up to     different viral loads per patient. And this is only done in four hours     times faster than the current state of the art  at a cost that will be five to     times cheaper than the current options. So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the Third World at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place. I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality. Thank you very much. Several years ago here at TED  Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge. And the idea's pretty simple  Teams of four have to build the tallest free standing structure out of    sticks of spaghetti  one yard of tape  one yard of string and a marshmallow. The marshmallow has to be on top. And  though it seems really simple  it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. And so  I thought this was an interesting idea  and I incorporated it into a design workshop. And it was a huge success. And since then  I've conducted about    design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects  even the CTOs of the Fortune     and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration  and I'd like to share some of them with you. So  normally  most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. They talk about it  they figure out what it's going to look like  they jockey for power. Then they spend some time planning  organizing  they sketch and they lay out spaghetti. They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures. And then finally  just as they're running out of time  someone takes out the marshmallow  and then they gingerly put it on top  and then they stand back  and    ta da     they admire their work. But what really happens  most of the time  is that the  ta da  turns into an  uh oh   because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse. So there are a number of people who have a lot more  uh oh  moments than others  and among the worst are recent graduates of business school. They lie  they cheat  they get distracted and they produce really lame structures. And of course there are teams that have a lot more  ta da  structures  and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten. And it's pretty amazing. As Peter tells us  not only do they produce the tallest structures  but they're the most interesting structures of them all. So the question you want to ask is  How come  Why  What is it about them  And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti  Inc. Right  They don't spend time jockeying for power. But there's another reason as well. And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan  right  And then they execute on it. And then what happens is  when they put the marshmallow on the top  they run out of time and what happens  It's a crisis. Sound familiar  Right. What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow  and they build prototypes  successive prototypes  always keeping the marshmallow on top  so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way. Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process. And with each version  kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential  but let's look at how different teams perform. So the average for most people is around    inches  business schools students  about half of that  lawyers  a little better  but not much better than that  kindergarteners  better than most adults. Who does the very best  Architects and engineers  thankfully. Thirty nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen. And why is it  Because they understand triangles and self reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures. So CEOs  a little bit better than average  but here's where it gets interesting. If you put you put an executive admin. on the team  they get significantly better. It's incredible. You know  you look around  you go   Oh  that team's going to win.  You can just tell beforehand. And why is that  Because they have special skills of facilitation. They manage the process  they understand the process. And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance. Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success. If you have    teams that typically perform  you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. And I tried something interesting. I thought  let's up the ante  once. So I offered a        dollar prize of software to the winning team. So what do you think happened to these design students  What was the result  Here's what happened  Not one team had a standing structure. If anyone had built  say  a one inch structure  they would have taken home the prize. So  isn't that interesting  That high stakes have a strong impact. We did the exercise again with the same students. What do you think happened then  So now they understand the value of prototyping. So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best. They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time. So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. So  you might ask  Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge  And the reason is  I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects. And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions. Because  frankly  every project has its own marshmallow  doesn't it  The challenge provides a shared experience  a common language  a common stance to build the right prototype. And so  this is the value of the experience  of this so simple exercise. And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com. It's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows. There's step by step instructions on this. There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system. There's world records that are on this as well. And the fundamental lesson  I believe  is that design truly is a contact sport. It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task  and that we apply the very best of our thinking  our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand. And sometimes  a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an  uh oh  moment to a  ta da  moment. And that can make a big difference. Thank you very much. One of the things that defines a TEDster is you've taken your passion  and you've turned it into stewardship. You actually put action to the issues you care about. But what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out. So  how do you do that  One of the things I should probably tell you is  I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career  and that sort of warped my framework. So  when you start to think about politicians  you've got to realize these are strange creatures. Other than the fact that they can't tell directions  and they have very strange breeding habits  how do you actually work with these things   Laughter  What we need to understand is  What drives the political creature  And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart  One is reputation and influence. These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job. The second one    unlike most animals  which is survival of the species    this is preservation of self. Now you may think it's money  but that's actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself. Now  the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time. So  what doesn't work  in terms of getting your issue to be important  You can send them an email. Well  unfortunately  I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me  your email is lost. It doesn't matter  it's spam. How about you get on the phone  Well  chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone   Yes  they called  and they said they didn't like it.  That doesn't move. Face to face would work  but it's hard to set it up. It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work. Yes  contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation  but it takes some time to build up. So what actually works  And the answer is rather strange. It's a letter. We live in a digital world  but we're fairly analog creatures. Letters actually work. Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read    letters that are picked out by staff. I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean. So  how are you going to write your letter  First of all  you're going to pick up an analog device  a pen. I know these are tough  and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it   Laughter  but this is actually critical. And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter. It is so novel to see this  that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me. Second of all  I'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month. Here's my promise to you  If you are consistent and do this  within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say   What do you think   Now  I'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with. Now  when you approach these animals  you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them  and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness. So in paragraph number one  what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this  You appreciate them. You may not appreciate the person  you may not appreciate anything else  but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig. When animals are going to make a point  they make the point. They don't spend a lot of time dicking around. So  here you go.  Laughter  Paragraph number two  You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind. When you do this  don't attack people  you attack tactics. Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere. Paragraph number three  When animals are attacked or cornered  they will fight to the death  so you have to give them an exit. Most of the time  if they have an exit strategy  they should take it.  Obviously  you're intelligent. If you had the right information  you would have done the right thing.   Laughter  Lastly  you want to be the nurturing agent. You're the safe place to come in to. So  in paragraph number four  you're going to tell people   If no one is providing you with this information  let me help.   Laughter  Animals do displays. They do two things  They warn you or they try to attract you and say   We need to mate.  You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter. You do a number of things  you're a vice president  you volunteer  you do something else. Why is is this important  Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature  that you have influence in a large sphere  and that my preservation depends on you. Here is one very quick hack  especially for the feds in the audience. Here's how you mail your letter. First of all  you send the original to the district office. So  you send the copy to the main office. If they follow protocol  they'll pick up the phone and say   Hey  do you have the original   Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says   Oh  this is an important letter.  And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read. So  what your letter means  I've got to tell you  we are all in a party  and political officials are the pinatas. We are harangued  lectured to  sold  marketed  but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication. I got this letter when I was first elected  and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to. This is an opportunity at real dialogue  and if you have stewardship and want to communicate  that dialogue is incredibly powerful. So when you do that  here's what I can promise  You're going to be the     pound gorilla in the forest. Get writing. Salaam. Namaskar. Good morning. Given my TED profile  you might be expecting that I'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends    the one that's currently got Wall Street and the World Bank buzzing    how to invest in women  how to empower them  how to save them. Not me. I am interested in how women are saving us. They're saving us by redefining and re imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities  polarities we've taken for granted for a long time  like the ones between modernity and tradition  First World and Third World  oppression and opportunity. In the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community  there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing. What intrigues me most is how women are doing this  despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating. Why is it that women are  on the one hand  viciously oppressed by cultural practices  and yet at the same time  are the preservers of cultures in most societies  Is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance  When so many women and girls are beaten  raped  maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes    honor  religion  nationality    what allows women to replant trees  to rebuild societies  to lead radical  non violent movements for social change  Is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing  Or are they one and the same  Are we guilty  as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us at the TED conference in Oxford  of assuming that there is a single story of women's struggles for their rights while there are  in fact  many  And what  if anything  do men have to do with it  Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions. It's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people. In the process  I've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle. Among those who've helped open my eyes to a third way are  a devout Muslim in Afghanistan  a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia and a taboo breaker in Liberia. I'm indebted to them  as I am to my parents  who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life  were blessed with three daughters in this one. And for reasons equally unclear to me  seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us. I was born and raised here in India  and I learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down  pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all   Poor things. You only have three daughters. But you're young  you could still try again.  My sense of outrage about women's rights was brought to a boil when I was about   . My aunt  an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman  was widowed early. A flock of relatives descended on her. They took off her colorful sari. They made her wear a white one. They wiped her bindi off her forehead. They broke her bangles. Her daughter  Rani  a few years older than me  sat in her lap bewildered  not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother. Late that night  I heard my mother begging my father   Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene   And my father  in a low voice  muttering   I'm just the youngest brother  there's nothing I can do. This is tradition.  That's the night I learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world. Women don't make those rules  but they define us  and they define our opportunities and our chances. And men are affected by those rules too. My father  who had fought in three wars  could not save his own sister from this suffering. By     under the excellent tutelage of my mother  I was therefore  as you might expect  defiantly feminist. On the streets chanting    Hindi   Hindi  We are the women of India. We are not flowers  we are sparks of change.  By the time I got to Beijing in       it was clear to me  the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition. Soon after I returned from Beijing  I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization  founded by women  to support women's rights organizations around the globe. But barely six months into my new job  I met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions. Her name is Sakena Yacoobi. She walked into my office at a time when no one knew where Afghanistan was in the United States. She said to me   It is not about the burka.  She was the most determined advocate for women's rights I had ever heard. She told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside Afghanistan  and that her organization  the Afghan Institute of Learning  had started a school in Pakistan. She said   The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows is that the Koran requires and strongly supports literacy. The prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the Koran for themselves.  Had I heard right  Was a women's rights advocate invoking religion  But Sakena defies labels. She always wears a headscarf  but I've walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze. She starts every lecture with a prayer  but she's a single  feisty  financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of   . She is also immensely pragmatic.  This headscarf and these clothes   she says   give me the freedom to do what I need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work. When I had to open the school in the refugee camp  I went to see the imam. I told him  'I'm a believer  and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive.'  She smiles slyly.  He was flattered. He began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque. And after he would leave  women and girls would stay behind. We began with a small literacy class to read the Koran  then a math class  then an English class  then computer classes. In a few weeks  everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes.  Sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in Afghanistan. She is on the Taliban's hit list. I worry about her every time she travels across that country. She shrugs when I ask her about safety.  Kavita jaan  we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid. Look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face.  And I smile  and I nod  realizing I'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices  turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity. Their path is their own and it looks towards an Afghanistan that will be different. Being different is something the women of Lesbor in Zagreb  Croatia know all too well. To be a lesbian  a dyke  a homosexual in most parts of the world  including right here in our country  India  is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice. In post conflict societies like Croatia  where a hyper nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast. So enter a group of out dykes  young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from Macedonia to Bosnia  from Serbia to Slovenia. These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program. Many are in their   s  some are mothers. Many have struggled to come out to their communities  in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick  just queer. As Leah  one of the founders of the group  says   I like traditional music very much. I also like rock and roll. So Lesbor  we blend the two. I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion  in which people can really speak their voice  especially traditional songs from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic. After the war  lots of these songs were lost  but they are a part of our childhood and our history  and we should not forget them.  Improbably  this LGBT singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change  like alchemists turning discord into harmony. Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem  a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets. And  Leah adds with a grin   Kavita  we especially are proud of our Christmas music  because it shows we are open to religious practices even though Catholic Church hates us LGBT.  Their concerts draw from their own communities  yes  but also from an older generation  a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality  but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents. One father  who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir  now writes songs for them. In the Middle Ages  troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses  Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this  singing  connecting people divided by religion  nationality and language. Bosnians  Croats and Serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history  and Lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all. Yesterday  Mallika Sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given. The world Leymah Gbowee was given was a world at war. Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades. Leymah was not an activist  she was a mother of three. But she was sick with worry  She worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier  she worried her daughters would be raped  she worried for their lives. One night  she had a dream. She dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed. The next morning at church  she asked others how they felt. They were all tired of the fighting. We need peace  and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace. Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim. She promised to raise the issue with her community. At the next Friday sermon  the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs.  What does it matter   they said   A bullet doesn't distinguish between a Muslim and a Christian.  This small group of women  determined to bring an end to the war  and they chose to use their traditions to make a point  Liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing. But no  for the protest  they dressed all in white  no makeup. As Leymah said   We wore the white saying we were out for peace.  They stood on the side of the road on which Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day. They stood for weeks    first just     then     then     then hundreds of women    wearing white  singing  dancing  saying they were out for peace. Eventually  opposing forces in Liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana. The peace talks dragged on and on and on. Leymah and her sisters had had enough. With their remaining funds  they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building. In a now famous CNN clip  you can see them sitting on the ground  their arms linked. We know this in India. It's called a  Hindi . Then things get tense. The police are called in to physically remove the women. As the senior officer approaches with a baton  Leymah stands up with deliberation  reaches her arms up over her head  and begins  very slowly  to untie her headdress that covers her hair. You can see the policeman's face. He looks embarrassed. He backs away. And the next thing you know  the police have disappeared. Leymah said to me later   It's a taboo  you know  in West Africa. If an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to  the man's family is cursed.  She said   I don't know if he did it because he believed  but he knew we were not going to leave. We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed.  And the peace accord was signed. And the women of Liberia then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in Africa in years. When she made her presidential address  she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia who allowed her to win against a football star    that's soccer for you Americans    no less. Women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that I should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind. They've also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way. A Filipina activist once said to me   How do you cook a rice cake  With heat from the bottom and heat from the top.  The protests  the marches  the uncompromising position that women's rights are human rights  full stop. That's the heat from the bottom. That's Malcolm X and the suffragists and gay pride parades. But we also need the heat from the top. And in most parts of the world  that top is still controlled by men. So to paraphrase Marx  Women make change  but not in circumstances of their own choosing. They have to negotiate. They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations. And they need allies from their communities. Allies like the imam  allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in Croatia  allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away  allies like my father  who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams. Maybe this is because feminism  unlike almost every other social movement  is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor    it's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers    it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women  far too often  hold ourselves. And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism  that the personal is in fact the political. So that  as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights  the same is true of gender equality  that it starts in small places  close to home. On the streets  yes  but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends. And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles  women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah    but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India and Michelle Bachelet in Chile and Shirin Ebadi in Iran    are doing something else. They're challenging the very notion of Western models of development. They are saying  we don't have to be like you to make change. We can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou  and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers. We can use our tradition to navigate change. We can demilitarize societies and pour resources  instead  into reservoirs of genuine security. It is in these little stories  these individual stories  that I see a radical epic being written by women around the world. It is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities  that I find hope. And if my heart is singing  it's because in these little fragments  every now and again  you catch a glimpse of a whole  of a whole new world. And she is definitely on her way. Thank you. So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea. Actually  I think it'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that's emerged in the past century. It's the idea of computation. Now  of course  that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on. But there's actually a lot more to computation than that. It's really a very deep  very powerful  very fundamental idea  whose effects we've only just begun to see. Well  I myself have spent the past    years of my life working on three large projects that really try to take the idea of computation seriously. So I started off at a young age as a physicist using computers as tools. Then  I started drilling down  thinking about the computations I might want to do  trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from and how they could be automated as much as possible. Eventually  I created a whole structure based on symbolic programming and so on that let me build Mathematica. And for the past    years  at an increasing rate  we've been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into Mathematica  and I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things in R   D and education  lots of other areas. Well  I have to admit  actually  that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica  I wanted to use it myself  a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope     years ago. But I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe  but at the computational universe. So we normally think of programs as being complicated things that we build for very specific purposes. But what about the space of all possible programs  Here's a representation of a really simple program. So  if we run this program  this is what we get. Very simple. So let's try changing the rule for this program a little bit. Now we get another result  still very simple. Try changing it again. You get something a little bit more complicated. But if we keep running this for a while  we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate  it has a very regular structure. So the question is  Can anything else happen  Well  we can do a little experiment. Let's just do a little mathematical experiment  try and find out. Let's just run all possible programs of the particular type that we're looking at. They're called cellular automata. You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here. Most of them do very simple things  but if you look along all these different pictures  at rule number     you start to see something interesting going on. So let's take a closer look at rule number    here. So here it is. We're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here  but we're getting all this amazing stuff. It's not at all what we're used to  and I must say that  when I first saw this  it came as a huge shock to my intuition. And  in fact  to understand it  I eventually had to create a whole new kind of science. This science is different  more general  than the mathematics based science that we've had for the past     or so years. You know  it's always seemed like a big mystery  how nature  seemingly so effortlessly  manages to produce so much that seems to us so complex. Well  I think we've found its secret  It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe and quite often getting things like Rule    or like this. And knowing that starts to explain a lot of long standing mysteries in science. It also brings up new issues  though  like computational irreducibility. I mean  we're used to having science let us predict things  but something like this is fundamentally irreducible. The only way to find its outcome is  effectively  just to watch it evolve. It's connected to  what I call  the principle of computational equivalence  which tells us that even incredibly simple systems can do computations as sophisticated as anything. It doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation  just something that happens  naturally  all over the place. Things with rules as simple as these can do it. Well  this has deep implications about the limits of science  about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies  about intelligence in the universe  about questions like free will and about creating technology. You know  in working on this science for many years  I kept wondering   What will be its first killer app   Well  ever since I was a kid  I'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge and somehow making it computable. People like Leibniz had wondered about that too     years earlier. But I'd always assumed that to make progress  I'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain. Well  then I got to thinking  This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different    and  by the way  I've now got huge computation capabilities in Mathematica  and I'm a CEO with some worldly resources to do large  seemingly crazy  projects    So I decided to just try to see how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world we could make computable. So  it's been a big  very complex project  which I was not sure was going to work at all. But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well. And last year we were able to release the first website version of Wolfram Alpha. Its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine that computes answers to questions. So let's give it a try. Let's start off with something really easy. Hope for the best. Very good. Okay. So far so good. Let's try something a little bit harder. Let's do some mathy thing  and with luck it'll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math. We could ask it something about the real world. Let's say    I don't know    what's the GDP of Spain  And it should be able to tell us that. Now we could compute something related to this  let's say ... the GDP of Spain divided by  I don't know  the    hmmm ... let's say the revenue of Microsoft. The idea is that we can just type this in  this kind of question in  however we think of it. So let's try asking a question  like a health related question. So let's say we have a lab finding that ... you know  we have an LDL level of     for a male aged   . So let's type that in  and now Wolfram Alpha will go and use available public health data and try and figure out what part of the population that corresponds to and so on. Or let's try asking about  I don't know  the International Space Station. And what's happening here is that Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something  it's computing  in real time  where the International Space Station is right now at this moment  how fast it's going  and so on. So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things. It's got  by now  pretty good coverage of everything you might find in a standard reference library. But the goal is to go much further and  very broadly  to democratize all of this knowledge  and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas. To be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have  not by searching what other people may have written down before  but by using built in knowledge to compute fresh new answers to specific questions. Now  of course  Wolfram Alpha is a monumentally huge  long term project with lots and lots of challenges. For a start  one has to curate a zillion different sources of facts and data  and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation and human domain experts for doing this. But that's just the beginning. Given raw facts or data to actually answer questions  one has to compute  one has to implement all those methods and models and algorithms and so on that science and other areas have built up over the centuries. Well  even starting from Mathematica  this is still a huge amount of work. So far  there are about   million lines of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha built by experts from many  many different fields. Well  a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language  which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them. And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible. Two big things happened  First  a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe  and second  the realization that having actual computable knowledge completely changes how one can set about understanding language. And  of course  now with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild  we can learn from its actual usage. And  in fact  there's been an interesting coevolution that's been going on between Wolfram Alpha and its human users  and it's really encouraging. Right now  if we look at web queries  more than    percent of them get handled successfully the first time. And if you look at things like the iPhone app  the fraction is considerably larger. So  I'm pretty pleased with it all. But  in many ways  we're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha. I mean  everything is scaling up very nicely and we're getting more confident. You can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology showing up in more and more places  working both with this kind of public data  like on the website  and with private knowledge for people and companies and so on. You know  I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge based computing  in which one's starting not just from raw computation  but from a vast amount of built in knowledge. And when one does that  one really changes the economics of delivering computational things  whether it's on the web or elsewhere. You know  we have a fairly interesting situation right now. On the one hand  we have Mathematica  with its sort of precise  formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines. Let me show you a couple of examples here. So here's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming. Here's something where we're sort of integrating a bunch of different capabilities here. Here we'll just create  in this line  a little user interface that allows us to do something fun there. If you go on  that's a slightly more complicated program that's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on. But it's something that is very precise stuff. It's a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes Mathematica to know what to do here. Then on the other hand  we have Wolfram Alpha  with all the messiness of the world and human language and so on built into it. So what happens when you put these things together  I think it's actually rather wonderful. With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica  you can  for example  make precise programs that call on real world data. Here's a real simple example. You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you're talking about. Let's try this here. But actually I think the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming. I mean  anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language. Then  the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they're asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger  precise programs. So  sometimes  Wolfram Alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with. Here's a big website where we've been collecting lots of educational and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things. I'll show you one example here. This is just an example of one of these computable documents. This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that's able to be run here. Okay. Let's zoom out again. So  given our new kind of science  is there a general way to use it to make technology  So  with physical materials  we're used to going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes. Well  it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe. There's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there. The challenge is to see how to harness them for human purposes. Something like Rule     for example  turns out to be a really good randomness generator. Other simple programs are good models for processes in the natural or social world. And  for example  Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica are actually now full of algorithms that we discovered by searching the computational universe. And  for example  this    if we go back here    this has become surprisingly popular among composers finding musical forms by searching the computational universe. In a sense  we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity. I'm hoping we can  for example  use that even to get Wolfram Alpha to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly  and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with. Well  so  that leads to kind of an ultimate question  Could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe we might find our physical universe  Perhaps there's even some quite simple rule  some simple program for our universe. Well  the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated. But in the computational universe  we've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior. So could that be what's going on with our whole universe  If the rules for the universe are simple  it's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level  operating  for example  far below the level of space or time  which makes it hard to represent things. But in at least a large class of cases  one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network  which  when it gets big enough  behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid. Well  then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network. And each possible rule  in a sense  corresponds to a candidate universe. Actually  I haven't shown these before  but here are a few of the candidate universes that I've looked at. Some of these are hopeless universes  completely sterile  with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space  no notion of time  no matter  other problems like that. But the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years is that you actually don't have to go very far in the computational universe before you start finding candidate universes that aren't obviously not our universe. Here's the problem  Any serious candidate for our universe is inevitably full of computational irreducibility. Which means that it is irreducibly difficult to find out how it will really behave  and whether it matches our physical universe. A few years ago  I was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity  and even general relativity and gravitation  and at least give hints of quantum mechanics. So  will we find the whole of physics  I don't know for sure  but I think at this point it's sort of almost embarrassing not to at least try. Not an easy project. One's got to build a lot of technology. One's got to build a structure that's probably at least as deep as existing physics. And I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is. Build a team  open it up  offer prizes and so on. But I'll tell you  here today  that I'm committed to seeing this project done  to see if  within this decade  we can finally hold in our hands the rule for our universe and know where our universe lies in the space of all possible universes ... and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha   the theory of the universe   and have it tell us. So I've been working on the idea of computation now for more than    years  building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas into millions of lines of code and grist for server farms and so on. With every passing year  I realize how much more powerful the idea of computation really is. It's taken us a long way already  but there's so much more to come. From the foundations of science to the limits of technology to the very definition of the human condition  I think computation is destined to be the defining idea of our future. Thank you. Chris Anderson  That was astonishing. Stay here. I've got a question. So  that was  fair to say  an astonishing talk. Are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe  Stephen Wolfram  Well  the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true  things like the standard model of physics  what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it's simply wrong. The things that people have tried to do in the last    years or so with string theory and so on have been an interesting exploration that has tried to get back to the standard model  but hasn't quite gotten there. My guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing may actually have considerable resonance with what's been done in string theory  but that's a complicated math thing that I don't yet know how it's going to work out. CA  Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience. He also has shown how complexity can arise out of a simple start. Does your work relate to his  SW  I think so. I view Benoit Mandelbrot's work as one of the founding contributions to this kind of area. Benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns  in fractals and so on  where the structure is something that's kind of tree like  and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches and even smaller branches and so on. That's one of the ways that you get towards true complexity. I think things like the Rule    cellular automaton get us to a different level. In fact  in a very precise way  they get us to a different level because they seem to be things that are capable of complexity that's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ... I could go on about this at great length  but I won't.  Laughter   Applause  CA  Stephen Wolfram  thank you. Hi  my name is Roz Savage and I row across oceans. Four years ago  I rowed solo across the Atlantic  and since then  I've done two out of three stages across the Pacific  from San Francisco to Hawaii and from Hawaii to Kiribati. And tomorrow  I'll be leaving this boat to fly back to Kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the Pacific. Cumulatively  I will have rowed over       miles  taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than     days alone on the ocean on a    foot rowboat. This has given me a very special relationship with the ocean. We have a bit of a love hate thing going on. I feel a bit about it like I did about a very strict math teacher that I once had at school. I didn't always like her  but I did respect her  and she taught me a heck of a lot. So today I'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me  and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now. Now  some of you might be thinking   Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower. Isn't she meant to be about this tall and about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys   You'll notice  they've all got something that I don't. Well  I don't know what you're thinking  but I'm talking about the beards.  Laughter  And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean  I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard  and I hope that it remains that way. For a long time  I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure. The story that I told myself was that adventurers looked like this. I didn't look the part. I thought there were them and there were us  and I was not one of them. So for    years  I conformed. I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do. I was working in an office in London as a management consultant. And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me. But that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years  until I reached my mid   s and I thought   You know  I'm not getting any younger. I feel like I've got a purpose in this life  and I don't know what it is  but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it. So  fast forward a few years. I'd gone through some changes. To try and answer that question of   What am I supposed to be doing with my life   I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary  the one that I wanted  a life of adventure  and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice  normal  pleasant life  but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life. I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of. And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking   Oh boy  I'm on totally the wrong track here. If I carry on living as I am now  I'm just not going to end up where I want to be in five years  or    years  or at the end of my life.  I made a few changes  let go of some loose trappings of my old life  and through a bit of a leap of logic  decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua  it's about       miles  and it turned out to be the hardest thing I had ever done. Sure  I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone  but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is  by definition  extremely uncomfortable. And my timing was not great either        when I did the Atlantic  was the year of Hurricane Katrina. There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic than ever before  since records began. And pretty early on  those storms started making their presence known. All four of my oars broke before I reached halfway across. Oars are not supposed to look like this. But what can you do  You're in the middle of the ocean. Oars are your only means of propulsion. So I just had to look around the boat and figure out what I was going to use to fix up these oars so that I could carry on. So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it. Then  when that gave out  I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those. And then when those gave out  I cannibalized one of the broken oars. I'd never been very good at fixing stuff when I was living my old life  but it's amazing how resourceful you can become when you're in the middle of the ocean and there's only one way to get to the other side. And the oars kind of became a symbol of just in how many ways I went beyond what I thought were my limits. I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom. I really struggled psychologically  totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge  realizing that  if I carried on moving at two miles an hour        miles was going to take me a very  very long time. There were so many times when I thought I'd hit that limit  but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy. And eventually after     days at sea  I arrived in Antigua. I don't think I've ever felt so happy in my entire life. It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an Oscar all rolled into one. I was euphoric. And to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering  I just felt like a movie star. It was absolutely wonderful. And I really learned then that  the bigger the challenge  the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it. So this might be a good moment to take a quick time out to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind. Number one that I get asked  What do you eat  A few freeze dried meals  but mostly I try and eat much more unprocessed foods. So I grow my own beansprouts. I eat fruits and nut bars  a lot of nuts. And generally arrive about    pounds lighter at the other end. Question number two  How do you sleep  With my eyes shut. Ha ha. I suppose what you mean is  What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping  Well  I plan my route so that I'm drifting with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping. On a good night  I think my best ever was    miles in the right direction. Worst ever     miles in the wrong direction. That's a bad day at the office. What do I wear  Mostly  a baseball cap  rowing gloves and a smile    or a frown  depending on whether I went backwards overnight    and lots of sun lotion. Do I have a chase boat  No I don't. I'm totally self supporting out there. I don't see anybody for the whole time that I'm at sea  generally. And finally  Am I crazy  Well  I leave that one up to you to judge. So  how do you top rowing across the Atlantic  Well  naturally  you decide to row across the Pacific. Well  I thought the Atlantic was big  but the Pacific is really  really big. I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps. I don't know for sure that the Brits invented this particular view of the world  but I suspect we might have done so  we are right in the middle  and we've cut the Pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world. Whereas if you look in Google Earth  this is how the Pacific looks. It pretty much covers half the planet. You can just see a little bit of North America up here and a sliver of Australia down there. It is really big       million square miles    and to row in a straight line across it would be about       miles. Unfortunately  ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line. By the time I get to Australia  if I get to Australia  I will have rowed probably nine or        miles in all. So  because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past Hawaii without dropping in  I decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments. The first attempt didn't go so well. In       I did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in    hours. A bit like being in a washing machine. Boat got a bit dinged up  so did I. I blogged about it. Unfortunately  somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving. The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead. I tried to tell them to go away. We had a bit of a battle of wills. I lost and got airlifted. Awful  really awful. It was one of the worst feelings of my life  as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the    foot waves and wondering if I would ever see her again. So I had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before I could get back out onto the ocean again. But what do you do  Fall down nine times  get up   . So  the following year  I set out and  fortunately  this time made it safely across to Hawaii. But it was not without misadventure. My watermaker broke  only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat. Powered by my solar panels  it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater. But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean  which is what happened to it. Fortunately  help was at hand. There was another unusual boat out there at the same time  doing as I was doing  bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch  that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas  with an estimated  .  million tons of trash in it  circulating at the center of that North Pacific Gyre. So  to make the point  these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash         empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons. They were going very slowly. Partly  they'd had a bit of a delay. They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone  and they were starting to sink. So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up. But  as I was approaching the end of my water reserves  luckily  our courses were converging. They were running out of food  I was running out of water. So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up. And it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge. I was doing a pathetically slow speed of about  .  knots  and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about  .   it was like two snails in a mating dance. But  eventually  we did manage to meet up and Joel hopped overboard  caught us a beautiful  big mahi mahi  which was the best food I'd had in  ooh  at least three months. Fortunately  the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier. When they opened this one up  they found its stomach was full of plastic. And this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance. It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it  and then we come along and eat that poor critter  and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well. So there are very real implications for human health. I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive. And  the following year  set out on the second stage of the Pacific  from Hawaii down to Tarawa. And you'll notice something about Tarawa  it is very low lying. It's that little green sliver on the horizon  which makes them very nervous about rising oceans. This is big trouble for these guys. They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level. And also  as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change  they're expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef  which will contaminate their fresh water supply. I had a meeting with the president there  who told me about his exit strategy for his country. He expects that within the next    years  the         people that live there will have to relocate to New Zealand or Australia. And that made me think about how would I feel if Britain was going to disappear under the waves  if the places where I'd been born and gone to school and got married  if all those places were just going to disappear forever. How  literally  ungrounded that would make me feel. Very shortly  I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia  and if I'm successful  I'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the Pacific. And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues  to bring a human face to the ocean. If the Atlantic was about my inner journey  discovering my own capabilities  maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey  figuring out how I can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world  and to take some of those things that I've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in. I think there are probably three key points here. The first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves. For so long  I told myself that I couldn't have an adventure because I wasn't six foot tall and athletic and bearded. And then that story changed. I found out that people had rowed across oceans. I even met one of them and she was just about my size. So even though I didn't grow any taller  I didn't sprout a beard  something had changed  My interior dialogue had changed. At the moment  the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff  that we need oil. But what about if we just change that story  We do have alternatives  and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives  those sustainable ones  to create a greener future. The second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions. We might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean  that it can't really make a difference. But it does. Generally  we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters. Yes  there have been the Exxon Valdezes and the Chernobyls  but mostly it's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals  day after day and year after year. And  by the same token  we can turn that tide. We can start making better  wiser  more sustainable decisions. And when we do that  we're not just one person. Anything that we do spreads ripples. Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag. Maybe if we all start doing this  we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line. That's just one example. This is a world wide community. The other point  It's about taking responsibility. For so much of my life  I wanted something else to make me happy. I thought if I had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life  then I could be happy. But when I wrote that obituary exercise  I actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that I needed to create my own future. I couldn't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me. And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist. I plan on being around for a long time  and when I'm    years old  I want to be happy and healthy. And it's very difficult to be happy on a planet that's racked with famine and drought. It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air. So  shortly  I'm going to be launching a new initiative called Eco Heroes. And the idea here is that all our Eco Heroes will log at least one green deed every day. It's meant to be a bit of a game. We're going to make an iPhone app out of it. We just want to try and create that awareness because  sure  changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world  but that attitude  that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug  that is what could change the world. I really believe that we stand at a very important point in history. We have a choice. We've been blessed  or cursed  with free will. We can choose a greener future  and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time. Thank you. Most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something  they are experts  they know what's going on. All of you know about the topic that I'm supposed to talk about. That is  you know what simplicity is  you know what complexity is. The trouble is  I don't. And what I'm going to do is share with you my ignorance on this subject. I want you to read this  because we're going to come back to it in a moment. The quote is from the fabled Potter Stewart opinion on pornography. And let me just read it  the important details here   Shorthand description   'hardcore pornography'   and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it. But I know it when I see it.  I'm going to come back to that in a moment. So  what is simplicity  It's good to start with some examples. A coffee cup    we don't think about coffee cups  but it's much more interesting than one might think    a coffee cup is a device  which has a container and a handle. The handle enables you to hold it when the container is filled with hot liquid. Why is that important  Well  it enables you to drink coffee. But also  by the way  the coffee is hot  the liquid is sterile  you're not likely to get cholera that way. So the coffee cup  or the cup with a handle  is one of the tools used by society to maintain public health. Scissors are your clothes  glasses enable you to see things and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs or run down by automobiles  and books are  after all  your education. But there's another class of simple things  which are also very important. Simple in function  but not at all simple in how they're constructed. And the two here are just examples. One is the cellphone  which we use every day. And it rests on a complexity  which has some characteristics very different from those that my friend Benoit Mandelbrot discussed  but are very interesting. And the other  of course  is a birth control pill  which  in a very simple way  fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices. So  there are two ways of thinking about this word  I think. And here I've corrupted the Potter Stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something    which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone  Internet and birth control pills    by saying that they're simple  the functions are simple  and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it. Or there may be another way of doing it  which is to think about the problem in terms of what    if you associate with moral philosophers    is called the teapot problem. The teapot problem I'll pose this way. Suppose you see a teapot  and the teapot is filled with hot water. And you then ask the question  Why is the water hot  And that's a simple question. It's like  what is simplicity  One answer would be  because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly    that's a kind of physical science argument. A second argument would be  because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on    that's an historical argument. A third is that I wanted hot water for tea    that's an intentional argument. And  since this is coming from a moral philosopher  the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe. All of these are possibilities. The point is that you get into trouble when you ask a single question with a single box for an answer  in which that single question actually is many questions with quite different meanings  but with the same words. Asking   What is simplicity   I think falls in that category. What is the state of science  And  interestingly  complexity is very highly evolved. We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is. Simplicity  for reasons that are a little bit obscure  is almost not pursued  at least in the academic world. We academics    I am an academic    we love complexity. You can write papers about complexity  and the nice thing about complexity is it's fundamentally intractable in many ways  so you're not responsible for outcomes.  Laughter  Simplicity    all of you really would like your Waring Blender in the morning to make whatever a Waring Blender does  but not explode or play Beethoven. You're not interested in the limits of these things. So what one is interested in has a lot to do with the rewards of the system. And there's a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence  not so much in thinking about simplicity. One of the things I want to do is to help you with a very important task    which you may not know that you have very often    which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation.  Laughter  And the words that I would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence  because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things. All right  what is complexity in this view of things  and what is emergence  We have  actually  a pretty good working definition of complexity. It is a system  like traffic  which has components. The components interact with one another. These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy. It turns out that  whenever you have that system  weird stuff happens  and you in Los Angeles probably know this better than anyone. Here's another example  which I put up because it's an example of really important current science. You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it  but that's a tiny part of the chemical reactions going on in each of your cells at any given moment. And it's like the traffic that you see. The amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells  but we don't know why. Anyone who tells you that we understand life  walk away. And let me reduce this to the simplest level. We've heard from Bill Gates recently. All of us  to some extent  study this thing called a Bill Gates. Terrific. You learn everything you can about that. And then there's another kind of thing that you might study  and you study that hard. That's a Bono  this is a Bono. But then  if you know everything you can know about those two things  and you put them together  what can you say about this combination  The answer is  not a lot. And that's complexity. Now  imagine building that up to a city  or to a society  and you've got  obviously  an interesting problem. All right  so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind. And I want to introduce a word that I think is very useful  which is stacking. And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity that has the characteristic that it is so simple and so reliable that I can build things with it. Or I'm going to use simple to mean reliable  predictable  repeatable. And I'm going to use as an example the Internet  because it's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity. We call it a complex system  which it is  but it's also something else. The Internet starts with mathematics  it starts with binary. And if you look at the list of things on the bottom  we are familiar with the Arabic numbers one to    and so on. In binary  one is       seven is     . The question is  Why is binary simpler than Arabic  And the answer is  simply  that if I hold up three fingers  you can count that easily  but if I hold up this  it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven. The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way of representing numbers. Anything else is more complicated. You can catch errors with it  it's unambiguous in its reading  there are lots of good things about binary. So it is very  very simple once you learn how to read it. Now  if you like to represent this zero and one of binary  you need a device. And think of things in your life that are binary  one of them is light switches. They can be on and off. That's binary. Now wall switches  we all know  fail. But our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up  some    years ago  with a very nice device  shown under that bell jar  which is a transistor. A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch. It turns things on and off  but it does so without moving parts and it doesn't fail  basically  for a very long period of time. So the second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the Internet. So  since the transistor is so simple  you can put lots of them together. And you put lots of them together and you come with something called integrated circuits. And a current integrated circuit might have in each one of these chips something like a billion transistors  all of which have to work perfectly every time. So that's the next layer of simplicity  and  in fact  integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they  in general  work really well. With integrated circuits  you can build cellphones. You all are accustomed to having your cellphones work the large majority of the time. In Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia in its cell phone coverage   Laughter  so that we're not accustomed to that all the time  but some of the time. But  in fact  if you have cell phones  you can now go to this nice lady who's somewhere like Namibia  and who is extremely happy with the fact that although she does not have an master's degree in electrical engineering from MIT  she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone to get power in some funny way. And from that comes the Internet. And this is a map of bitflows across the continent. The two blobs that are light in the middle there are the United States and Europe. And then back to simplicity again. So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas  which is Google. Which  in this simple portal makes the claim that it makes accessible all of the world's information. But the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers of simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple  in the sense that it is completely reliable. All right  let me then finish off with four general statements  an example and two aphorisms. The characteristics  which I think are useful to think about for simple things  First  they are predictable. Their behavior is predictable. Now  one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it's going to do  in general. So simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things. The second is  and this is a real world statement  they're cheap. If you have things that are cheap enough  people will find uses for them  even if they seem very primitive. So  for example  stones. You can build cathedrals out of stones  you just have to know what it does. You carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another  and they support weight. So there has to be function  the function has to be predictable and the cost has to be low. What that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost. And then I would propose as this last component that they serve  or have the potential to serve  as building blocks. That is  you can stack them. And stack can mean this way  or it can mean this way  or it can mean in some arbitrary n dimensional space. But if you have something that has a function  and it's really cheap  people will find new ways of putting it together to make new things. Cheap  functional  reliable things unleash the creativity of people who then build stuff that you could not imagine. There's no way of predicting the Internet based on the first transistor. It just is not possible. So these are the components. Now  the example is something that I want to give you from the work that we ourselves do. We are very interested in delivering health care in the developing world  and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis at as close to zero cost as we can manage. So  how does one do that  This is a world in which there's no electricity  there's no money  there's no medical competence. And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details  but in the lower right hand corner  you see an example of the kind of thing that we have. It's a little paper chip. It has a few things printed on it using the same technology that you use for making comic books  which was the inspiration for this particular idea. And you put a drop  in this case  of urine at the bottom. It wicks its way up into these little branches. You know  no power required. It turns colors. In this particular case  you're reading kidney function. And  since the health care worker of much of this part of the world is an    year old with an AK     who happens to be out of work and is willing to go around and do this sort of thing  he can take a picture of it with his cellphone  send the picture back to where there is a doctor  and the doctor can look at it. So what you've done is to take a technology  which is available everywhere  make a device  which is extremely cheap  and make it in such a fashion that it is very  very reliable. If we can pull this off  if we can build more function  it will be stackable. That is to say  if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work  it will be applicable to a very  very large variety of human conditions  and hence  extendable in both vertical and horizontal directions. Part of my interest in this  I have to say  is that I would like to    how do I put this politely     change the way  or maybe eviscerate  the capital structure of the U.S. health care system  which I think is fundamentally broken. So  let me close    Let me close with my two aphorisms. One of them is from Mr. Einstein  and he says   Everything should be made as simple as possible  but not simpler.  And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem. If you take too much out of something that's simple  you lose function. You have to have low cost  but you also have to have a function. So you can't make it too simple. And the second is a design issue  and it's not directly relevant  but it's a nice statement. This is by de Saint Exupery. And he says   You know you've achieved perfection in design  not when you have nothing more to add  but when you have nothing more to take away.  And that certainly is going in the right direction. So  what I think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity  which doesn't cover Brancusi  it doesn't answer the question of why Mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh  and certainly doesn't address the question of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach. But it does make a point    which is one which  in a sense  differentiates the real world of people who make things  and the world of people who think about things  which is  there is an intellectual merit to asking  How do we make things as simple as we can  as cheap as we can  as functional as we can and as freely interconnectable as we can  If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology and then give it to you guys  you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Quick question. So can you picture that a science of simplicity might get to the point where you could look out at various systems    say a financial system or a legal system  health system    and say   That has got to the point of danger or dysfunctionality for the following reasons  and this is how we might simplify it   George Whitesides  Yes  I think you could. Because if you look at the components from which the system is made and examine their fragility  or their stability  you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis. CA  Have you started to do that  I mean  with the health system  you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side  but in terms of the system itself  GW  Well  no. How do I put that simply  No. CA  That was a simple  powerful answer. GW  Yes. CA  So  in terms of that diagnostic technology that you've got  where is that  and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale. GW  That's coming out soon. I mean  the systems work  and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind  but the basic technology works. CA  You've got a company set up to ... GW  A foundation  a foundation. Not for profit. CA  All right. Well  thank you so much for your talk. Thank you.  Applause  If you go on the TED website  you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos  over  .  million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings. And that's a huge amount of data. And it got me wondering  If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis  could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk  Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk  And also  could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with  To find this out  I looked at three things  I looked at the topic that you should choose  I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage. Now  with the topic  There's a whole range of topics you can choose  but you should choose wisely  because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk. Now  to make this more concrete  let's look at the list of top    words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks. So if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains  that's a go. Whereas  if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen  girls  aircraft    actually  I would like to hear that talk   Laughter  but statistics say it's not so good. Oh  well. If you generalize this  the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with  both easily and deeply  such as happiness  our own body  food  emotions. And the more technical topics  such as architecture  materials and  strangely enough  men  those are not good topics to talk about. How should you deliver your talk  TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock  so they're going to hate me for revealing this  because  actually  you should talk as long as they will let you.  Laughter  Because the most favorite TEDTalks are  on average  over    percent longer than the least favorite ones. And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful  inspiring or funny. Then  you should be brief.  Laughter  But other than that  talk until they drag you off the stage. Now  while ... While you're pushing the clock  there's a few rules to obey. I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks. I'll give you three examples. First of all  I must  as a speaker  provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you  instead of saying what I can't have. Secondly  it's imperative that you do not cite The New York Times. And finally  it's okay for the speaker    that's the good news    to fake intellectual capacity. If I don't understand something  I can just say   etc.  etc.  You'll all stay with me. It's perfectly fine. Now  let's go to the visuals. The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker. And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers  you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average  make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed up than the average TED speaker. Slides are okay  though you might consider going for props. And now the most important thing  that is the mood onstage. Color plays a very important role. Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website. For example  fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color   Laughter  much more than the average TEDTalk. Ingenious TEDTalks  much more this green color  etc.  et. Now  personally  I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis  but I'll leave this to your good judgment. So  now it's time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk. Now  since this is TEDActive  and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something  I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you  but rather give you a tool to create your own. And I call this tool the TEDPad. And the TEDPad is a matrix of     specifically selected  highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk. You only have to make one decision  and that is  Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks  about creativity  human genius  Or are you going to go with a black version  which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks  mostly about blogs  politics and stuff  So  download it and have fun with it. Now I hope you enjoy the session. I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks. And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this  which I really want to see. Thank you very much.
