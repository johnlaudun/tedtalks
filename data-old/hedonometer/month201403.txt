I had brain surgery    years ago  and since that time  brain science has become a personal passion of mine. I'm actually an engineer. And first let me say  I recently joined Google's Moonshot group  where I had a division  the display division in Google X  and the brain science work I'm speaking about today is work I did before I joined Google and on the side outside of Google. So that said  there's a stigma when you have brain surgery. Are you still smart or not  And if not  can you make yourself smart again  After my neurosurgery  part of my brain was missing  and I had to deal with that. It wasn't the grey matter  but it  was the gooey part dead center that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters. Immediately after my surgery  I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day  because if I just took nothing  I would die within hours. Every day now for    years    every single day    I've had to try to decide the combinations and mixtures of chemicals  and try to get them  to stay alive. There have been several close calls. But luckily  I'm an experimentalist at heart  so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn't a clear road map on this that's detailed. I began to try different mixtures  and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self  my sense of who I was  my thinking  my behavior towards people. One particularly dramatic case  for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early   s  and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed. I was angry all the time  I thought about sex constantly  and I thought I was the smartest person in the entire world  and   Laughter   of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that  or maybe kind of toned down versions of that. I was kind of extreme. But to me  the surprise was  I wasn't trying to be arrogant. I was actually trying  with a little bit of insecurity  to actually fix a problem in front of me  and it just didn't come out that way. So I couldn't handle it. I changed my dosages. But that experience  I think  gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through  and I've gotten along with men a lot better since then. What I was trying to do with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery  my creative thought  my idea flow. And I think mostly in images  and so for me that became a key metric    how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping  if you will  my ideas  trying on different new ideas for size  playing out scenarios. This kind of thinking isn't new. Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes saw things similarly. They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing. There are those today that dispute that  and lots of debates about how the mind works  but for me it's simple  Mental images  for most of us  are central in inventive and creative thinking. So after several years  I tuned myself up and I have lots of great  really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them. And so now I'm working on  how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster  Can you imagine  if you will  a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her  Or a musician to get the music out of his head  There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed. And the truth is  the remaining bottleneck in being able to do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems. So let me show you why I think  we're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups. Both used fMRI technology    functional magnetic resonance imaging technology    to image the brain  and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis and his colleagues at Harvard. And the left hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image. The middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining  seeing that same image. And the right column was created by subtracting the middle  column from the left column  showing the difference to be nearly zero. This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images  always with a similar result. The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing. Next let me share with you one other experiment  this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley. They've been able to decode brainwaves into recognizable visual fields. So let me set this up for you. In this experiment  individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences. Then a new movie was shown with new images  new people  new animals in it  and a new scan set was recorded. The computer  using brain scan data alone  decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the  individual was actually seeing. On the right hand side  you see the computer's guess  and on the left hand side  the presented clip. This is the jaw dropper. We are so close to being able to do this. We just need to up the resolution. And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image  it creates the same brain scan. So this was done with the highest resolution brain scan systems available today  and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years. Next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse. How do we do that  There's a lot of techniques in this approach. One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes. I'm not for that. There's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed  some even by me  but given the recent success of MRI  first we need to ask the question  is it the end of the road with this technology  Conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets  but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements  not the thousandfold we need. I'm putting forward an idea  instead of bigger magnets  let's make better magnets. There's some new technology breakthroughs in nanoscience when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magnets  and with these magnets  we can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain  and using those  we can actually create holographic like interference structures to get precision control over many patterns  as is shown here by shifting things. We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arrangements  kind of like making Spirograph. So why does that matter  A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big  really huge magnets  right  But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the MRI systems. Let's also  instead of a uniform magnetic field  put down structured magnetic patterns in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies. So by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan. And on top of that  we can then layer our ever growing knowledge  of brain structure and memory to create a thousandfold increase that we need. And using fMRI  we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow  but the hormones and neurotransmitters  I've talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity  which is the dream. We're going to be able to dump our ideas directly to digital media. Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought  What would we be capable of then  And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought  You think the Internet was big. These are huge questions. It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills. And indeed  this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases. We have little option but to open this door. Regardless  pick a year    will it happen in five years or    years  It's hard to imagine it taking much longer. We need to learn how to take this step together. Thank you. I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology. We tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic thought  perhaps rather timeless. I'm going to argue that  in fact  business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology  that those assumptions are changing  and  in fact  changing quite dramatically  and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy. Let me start  if I may  with a little bit of history. The idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants  Bruce Henderson  the founder of BCG  and Michael Porter  professor at the Harvard Business School. Henderson's central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness  of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that  in the business world  there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns    scale  experience. The more you do of something  disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. Porter agreed with that premise  but he qualified it. He pointed out  correctly  that that's all very well  but businesses actually have multiple steps to them. They have different components  and each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy. A company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged in others. He formed the concept of the value chain  essentially the sequence of steps with which a  shall we say  raw material  becomes a component  becomes assembled into a finished product  and then is distributed  for example  and he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components  and that the advantage of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average of that of its parts. And this idea of the value chain was predicated on the recognition that what holds a business together is transaction costs  that in essence you need to coordinate  organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets  very often  and therefore the nature and role and boundaries of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs. It was on those two ideas  Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience  and Porter's idea of the value chain  encompassing heterogenous elements  that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected. Now what I'm going to argue is that those premises are  in fact  being invalidated. First of all  let's think about transaction costs. There are really two components to transaction costs. One is about processing information  and the other is about communication. These are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long period of time. As we all know from so many contexts  they have been radically transformed since the days when Porter and Henderson first formulated their theories. In particular  since the mid '  s  communications costs have actually been falling even faster than transaction costs  which is why communication  the Internet  has exploded in such a dramatic fashion. Now  those falling transaction costs have profound consequences  because if transaction costs are the glue that hold value chains together  and they are falling  there is less to economize on. There is less need for vertically integrated organization  and value chains at least can break up. They needn't necessarily  but they can. In particular  it then becomes possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another. That is not just an abstract proposition. There are many very specific stories of how that actually happened. A poster child example was the encyclopedia business. The encyclopedia business in the days of leatherbound books was basically a distribution business. Most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen. The CD ROM and then the Internet came along  new technologies made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper  and the encyclopedia industry collapsed. It's now  of course  a very familiar story. This  in fact  more generally was the story of the first generation of the Internet economy. It was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation  or what we call deconstruction. One of the questions I was occasionally asked was  well  what's going to replace the encyclopedia when Britannica no longer has a business model  And it was a while before the answer became manifest. Now  of course  we know what it is  it's the Wikipedia. Now what's special about the Wikipedia is not its distribution. What's special about the Wikipedia is the way it's produced. The Wikipedia  of course  is an encyclopedia created by its users. And this  in fact  defines what you might call the second decade of the Internet economy  the decade in which the Internet as a noun became the Internet as a verb. It became a set of conversations  the era in which user generated content and social networks became the dominant phenomenon. Now what that really meant in terms of the Porter Henderson framework was the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale. It turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia could do just as good a job  and certainly a much cheaper job  than professionals in a hierarchical organization. So basically what was happening was that one layer of this value chain was becoming fragmented  as individuals could take over where organizations were no longer needed. But there's another question that obviously this graph poses  which is  okay  we've gone through two decades    does anything distinguish the third  And what I'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third  and it maps exactly on to the kind of Porter Henderson logic that we've been talking about. And that is  about data. If we go back to around       a lot of people were talking about the information revolution  and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data was growing  indeed growing quite fast. but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog. We go forward to       not only had the world's stock of data exploded  but there'd been this massive substitution of digital for analog. And more important even than that  if you look more carefully at this graph  what you will observe is that about a half of that digital data is information that has an I.P. address. It's on a server or it's on a P.C. But having an I.P. address means that it can be connected to any other data that has an I.P. address. It means it becomes possible to put together half of the world's knowledge in order to see patterns  an entirely new thing. If we run the numbers forward to today  it probably looks something like this. We're not really sure. If we run the numbers forward to       we of course have an exact number  courtesy of IDC. It's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present. And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication in the stock of information that is connected via an I.P. address. Now  if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points  a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten thousandfold multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data  this just in the last    or    years. This  I would submit  is a sea change  a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in. The first human genome  that of James Watson  was mapped as the culmination of the Human Genome Project in the year       and it took about     million dollars and about    years of work to map just one person's genomic makeup. Since then  the costs of mapping the genome have come down. In fact  they've come down in recent years very dramatically indeed  to the point where the cost  is now below       dollars  and it's confidently predicted that by the year      it will be below     dollars    a five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a    year period  an extraordinary phenomenon. Now  in the days when mapping a genome cost millions  or even tens of thousands  it was basically a research enterprise. Scientists would gather some representative people  and they would see patterns  and they would try and make generalizations about human nature and disease from the abstract patterns they find from these particular selected individuals. But when the genome can  be mapped for     bucks     dollars while you wait  then what happens is  it becomes retail. It becomes above all clinical. You go the doctor with a cold  and if he or she hasn't done it already  the first thing they do is map your genome  at which point what they're now doing is not starting from some abstract  knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you  but they're starting from your particular genome. Now think of the power of that. Think of where that takes us when we can combine genomic data with clinical data with data about drug interactions with the kind of ambient data that devices like our phone and medical sensors will increasingly be collecting. Think what happens when we collect all of that data and we can put it together in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before. This  I would suggest  perhaps it will take a while  but this will drive a revolution in medicine. Fabulous  lots of people talk about this. But there's one thing that doesn't get much attention. How is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases compatible with the business models of institutions and organizations and corporations that are involved in this business today  If your business is based on proprietary data  if your competitive advantage is defined by your data  how on Earth is that company or is that society in fact going to achieve the value that's implicit in the technology  They can't. So essentially what's happening here  and genomics is merely one example of this  is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it  and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated. The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated  oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving  by one means or another  from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening  It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together  and allows them to separate. The polarization of scale economies towards the very small    small is beautiful    allows for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production. The scaling in the opposite direction  towards things like big data  drive the structure of business towards the creation of new kinds of institutions that can achieve that scale. But either way  the typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal. The logic isn't just about big data. If we were to look  for example  at the telecommunications industry  you can tell the same story about fiber optics. If we look at the pharmaceutical industry  or  for that matter  university research  you can say exactly the same story about so called  big science.  And in the opposite direction  if we look  say  at the energy sector  where all the talk is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and efficient conservers of energy  that is  in fact  the reverse phenomenon. That is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale. Either way  what we are driven to is this horizontalization of the structure of industries  and that implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy. It means  for example  that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure  where things like business definition and even industry definition are actually the outcomes of strategy  not something that the strategy presupposes. It means  for example  we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition simultaneously. Think about the genome. We need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously. And we need industry structures that will accommodate very  very different motivations  from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments  or  for that matter  cooperative institutions built by companies that are otherwise competing  because that is the only way that they can get to scale. These kinds of transformations render the traditional premises  of business strategy obsolete. They drive us into a completely new world. They require us  whether we are in the public sector or the private sector  to think very fundamentally differently about the structure of business  and  at last  it makes strategy interesting again. Thank you. The      Arab Spring captured the attention of the world. It also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries  who were worried that revolution would spread. To respond  they ramped up surveillance of activists  journalists and dissidents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries. One prominent Bahraini activist  who was arrested and tortured by his government  has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages. Of course  it's no secret that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages. It's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone. Instead  they use tools like Skype  which they think are immune to interception. They're wrong. There have now been over the last few years an industry of companies who provide surveillance technology to governments  specifically technology that allows those governments to hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Rather than intercepting the communications  as they go over the wire  instead they now hack into your computer  enable your webcam  enable your microphone  and steal documents from your computer. When the government of Egypt fell in       activists raided the office of the secret police  and among the many documents they found was this document by the Gamma Corporation  by Gamma International. Gamma is a German company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments. It's important to note that most governments don't really have the in house capabilities to develop this software. Smaller ones don't have the resources or the expertise  and so there's this market of Western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price. Gamma is just one of these companies. I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government. They'd sent them an invoice for a sale  but the Egyptians never bought it. Instead  apparently  the Egyptian government used a free demo version of Gamma's software. So this screenshot is from a sales video that Gamma produced. Really  they're just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it's going on. You know  your webcam light won't turn on. There's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled. This is the managing director of Gamma International. His name is Martin Muench. There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist. This is perhaps my favorite. I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam. You can see there's a little sticker that's placed over his camera. He knows what kind of surveillance is possible  and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used against him. Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles. Of course  he's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments  he has no way of knowing how it can be used. Gamma's software has been located on servers in countries around the world  many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations. They really are selling their software around the world. Gamma is not the only company in the business. As I said  it's a    billion industry. One of the other big guys in the industry is an Italian company called Hacking Team. Now  Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation. The video they've produced is very sexy  and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients. You have to hack your target.   While your target is browsing the web  exchanging documents  receiving SMS  crossing the borders   You have to hit many different platforms.   Windows  OS X  iOS  Android  Blackberry  Symbian  Linux   You have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data.  Skype   encrypted calls  target location   messaging  relationships  web browsing  audio   video   Being stealth and untraceable.   Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure   Deployed all over your country.   Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot   Exactly what we do. Christopher Soghoian  So  it would be funny if it wasn't true  but  in fact  Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world. Last year we learned  for example  that it's been used to target Moroccan  journalists by the Moroccan government. Many  many countries it's been found in. So  Hacking Team has also been actively courting the U.S. law enforcement market. In the last year or so  the company has opened a sales office in Maryland. The company has also hired a spokesperson. They've been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up. They've spoken at the conferences. What I thought was most fascinating was they've actually paid for the coffee break at one of the law enforcement conferences earlier this year. I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team has sold their technology in the United States  but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it  it isn't because they haven't been trying hard. So as I said before  governments that don't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off the shelf surveillance software  and so for that reason  you see that the government of  say  Tunisia  might use the same software as the government of Germany. They're all buying off the shelf stuff. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States does have the budget to build their own surveillance technology  and so for several years  I've been trying to figure out if and how the FBI is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets. My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation    they're a civil society group   obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies. Most of these documents were heavily redacted  but what you can see from the slides  if I zoom in  is this term  Remote Operations Unit. Now  when I first looked into this  I'd never heard of this unit before. I've been studying surveillance for more than six years. I'd never heard of it. And so I went online and I did some research  and ultimately I hit the mother lode when I went to LinkedIn  the social networking site for job seekers. There were lots of former U.S. government contractors who had at one point worked for the Remote Operating Unit  and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs what they had done in their former job. So I took this information and I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal  and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes  in fact  the FBI has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets. Like Gamma and Hacking Team  the FBI also has the capability to remotely activate webcams  microphones  steal documents  get web browsing information  the works. There's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking  and that's that terrorists  pedophiles  drug dealers  journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers. There's no drug dealer phone and there's no journalist laptop. We all use the same technology  and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys  they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too. So governments around the world have been embracing this technology. They've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique  but without any real debate. In the United States  where I live  there have been no congressional hearings. There's no law that's been passed specifically authorizing this technique  and because of its power and potential for abuse  it's vital that we have an informed public debate. Thank you very much. This is a vending machine in Los Angeles. It's in a shopping mall  and it sells fish eggs. It's a caviar vending machine. This is the Art o mat  an art vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists  usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes  in limited edition. This is Oliver Medvedik. He's not a vending machine  but he is one of the founders of Genspace  a community biolab in Brooklyn  New York  where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA. In fact  I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago  and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that I'm going to talk to you right now. Because strawberry DNA is really  fascinating  because it's so beautiful. I'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before  before I saw it in this form. And a lot of people  especially in the art community  don't necessarily engage in science in this way. I instantly joined Genspace after this  and I asked Oliver   Well  if we can do this strawberries  can we do this with people as well   And about    minutes later  we were both spinning it in vials together and coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction. And I started doing this on my own  and this is what my DNA actually looks like. And I was at a dinner party with some friends  some artist friends  and I was telling them about this project  and they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA. So I said  all right  let's get out some supplies right now. And I started having these bizarre dinner  parties at my house on Friday nights where people would come over and we would do DNA extractions  and I would actually capture them on video  because it created this kind of funny portrait as well. These are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science whatsoever. You can kind of tell from their reactions. But they became fascinated by it  and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science. And so I started doing this regularly. It's kind of an odd thing to do with your Friday nights  but this is what I started doing  and I started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials and categorizing them. This is what that looked like. And it started to make me think about a couple of things. First of all  this looked a lot like my Facebook wall. So in a way  I've created sort of a genetic network  a genetic social network  really. And the second thing was  one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like   Oh. Why are they numbered  Is this person more rare than the other one   And I hadn't even thought about that. They were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in. But that made me think about collecting toys  and this thing that's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys  and being able to collect these rare toys. You buy these boxes. You're not sure what's going to be inside of them. But then  when you open them up  you have different rarities of the toys. And so I thought that was interesting. I started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the Art o mat all together  and some reason  I was one night drawing a vending machine  thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine  and the little vial of my DNA was sitting there  and I saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA and the coils of a vending machine. And so  of course  I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine. Here it is.   DNA Vending Machine is an art installation about our increasing access to biotechnology.     For a reasonable cost  you can purchase a sample of human DNA from a traditional vending machine.     Each sample comes packaged with a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen.     DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material and brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA.   Gabriel Garcia Colombo  So the DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple galleries in New York  and it's selling out pretty well  actually. We're in the first edition of     pieces  hoping to do another edition pretty soon. I'd actually like to get it into more of a metro hub  like Grand Central or Penn Station  right next to some of the other  actual  vending machines in that location. But really with this project and a lot of my art projects I want to ask the audience a question  and that is  when biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as  say  laser cutting or  D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine  will you still submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine  And how much will these samples be worth  And will you buy someone else's sample  And what will you be able to do with that sample  Thank you. The year is     . A curious little invention is being talked about. It's called a microscope. What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye. Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases. Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup  not very far from here. This is from London. Fast forward     years. We still have this monster soup around  and it's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt. Just for malaria itself  there are a million deaths a year  and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections. Now it's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters. You take a stain  like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa  and a microscope  and you look at them. They all have faces. Why is that so  that Alex in Kenya  Fatima in Bangladesh  Navjoot in Mumbai  and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick  And that's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach. And remember that number  one billion. The problem lies with the microscope itself. Even though the pinnacle of modern science  research microscopes are not designed for field testing. Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all. They are heavy  bulky  really hard to maintain  and cost a lot of money. This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '  s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram in Sevagram in India. Two of my students  Jim and James  traveled around India and Thailand  starting to think about this problem a lot. We saw all kinds of donated equipment. We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses. And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn't know how to even turn it on. What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes. So what is a Foldscope  A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope  a platform for fluorescence  bright field  polarization  projection  all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper. So  now you think  how is that possible  I'm going to show you some examples here  and we will run through some of them. It starts with a single sheet of paper. What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright field and fluorescence microscope. So  there are three stages  There is the optical stage  the illumination stage and the mask holding stage. And there are micro optics at the bottom that's actually embedded in the paper itself. What you do is  you take it on  and just like you are playing like a toy  which it is  I tab it off  and I break it off. This paper has no instructions and no languages. There is a code  a color code embedded  that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope. When it's done  it looks something like this  has all the functionalities of a standard microscope  just like an XY stage  a place where a sample slide could go  for example right here. We didn't want to change this  because this is the standard that's been optimized for over the years  and many health workers are actually used to this. So this is what changes  but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases. You pop this in. There is an XY stage  and then there is a focusing stage  which is a flexure mechanism that's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps. So what's really interesting about this object  and my students hate when I do this  but I'm going to do this anyway  is these are rugged devices. I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it. And they last  even though they're designed from a very flexible material  like paper. Another fun fact is  this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool  but here in this envelope I have    different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder. And I'm going to pick one randomly. This one  it turns out  is actually designed specifically for malaria  because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria. So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this. So up till now  you didn't actually see what I would see from one of these setups. So what I would like to do is  if we could dim the lights  please  it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes. I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn    go to the back of the wall    and just project  and this way you will see exactly what I would see. What you're looking at    This is a cross section of a compound eye  and when I'm going to zoom in closer  right there  I am going through the z axis. You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross section pattern. Another example  one of my favorite insects  I love to hate this one  is a mosquito  and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens. Right there. All from the simple setup that I actually described. So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer. So it turns out they're waterproof  and    right here is just fluorescent water  and I don't know if you can actually see this. This also shows you how  the projection scope works. You get to see the beam the  way it's projected and bent. Can we get the lights back on again  So I'm quickly going to show you  since I'm running out of time  in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture  the biggest idea was roll to roll manufacturing  so we built this out of    cents of parts and costs. And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy  which we call use and throw microscopy. I'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in. Here is a sheet of paper. This is when we were thinking about the idea. This is an A  sheet of paper. These are the three stages that you actually see. And the optical components  if you look at the inset up on the right  we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs  so it uses a process of self assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself. So that's where the lenses go. There are some light sources. And essentially  in the end  all the parts line up because of origami  because of the fact that origami allows us micron scale precision of optical alignment. So even though this looks like a simple toy  the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated. So here is another obvious thing that we would do  typically  if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust  is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself. There it is  and it survives. So for us  the next step actually is really finishing our field trials. We are starting at the end of the summer. We are at a stage where we'll be  making thousands of microscopes. That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place. We've started collecting data for malaria  Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves. And I want to leave you with this picture. I had not anticipated this before  but a really interesting link between hands on science education and global health. What are the tools that we're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow  I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets. Thank you. I work with children with autism. Specifically  I make technologies to help them communicate. Now  many of the problems that children with autism face  they have a common source  and that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction  symbolism. And because of this  they have  a lot of difficulty with language. Let me tell you a little bit about why this is. You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup. All of us can see it. All of us understand this. These are two other pictures of soup  but you can see that these are more abstract These are not quite as concrete. And when you get to language  you see that it becomes a word whose look  the way it looks and the way it sounds  has absolutely nothing to do  with what it started with  or what it represents  which is the bowl of soup. So it's essentially a completely abstract  a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world  and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount of difficulty with. Now that's why most of the people  that work with children with autism    speech therapists  educators    what they do is  they try to help children with autism communicate not with words  but with pictures. So if a child with autism wanted to say   I want soup   that child would pick three different pictures   I    want   and  soup   and they would put these together  and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say. And this has been incredibly effective  for the last        years people have been doing this. In fact  a few years back  I developed an app for the iPad which does exactly this. It's called Avaz  and the way it works is that kids select different pictures. These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences  and these sentences are spoken out. So Avaz is essentially converting pictures  it's a translator  it converts pictures into speech. Now  this was very effective. There are thousands of children using this  you know  all over the world  and I started thinking about what it does and what it doesn't do. And I realized something interesting  Avaz helps children with autism learn words. What it doesn't help them do is to learn word patterns. Let me explain this in a little more detail. Take this sentence   I want soup tonight.  Now it's not just the words here that convey the meaning. It's also the way in which these words are arranged  the way these words are modified and arranged. And that's why a sentence like  I want soup tonight  is different from a sentence like  Soup want I tonight   which  is completely meaningless. So there is another hidden abstraction here which children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with  and that's the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings  to convey different ideas. Now  this is what we call grammar. And grammar is incredibly powerful  because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information  an infinite amount of ideas. It's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to. And so after I developed Avaz  I worried for a very long time about how I could give grammar  to children with autism. The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective. I happened to chance upon a child with autism conversing with her mom  and this is what happened. Completely out of the blue  very spontaneously  the child got up and said   Eat.  Now what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions. So she asked   Eat what  Do  you want to eat ice cream  You want to eat  Somebody else wants to eat  You want to eat cream now  You want to eat ice cream in the evening   And then it struck me that what the mother had done was something incredible. She had been able to get that child to communicate an idea to her without grammar. And it struck me that maybe this is what I was looking for. Instead of arranging words in an order  in sequence  as a sentence  you arrange them in this map  where they're all linked together not by placing them one after the other but in questions  in question answer pairs. And so if you do this  then what you're conveying is not a sentence in English  but what you're conveying is really a meaning  the meaning of a sentence in English. Now  meaning is really the underbelly  in some sense  of language. It's what comes after thought but before language. And the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form. So I was very excited by this  you know  hopping around all over the place  trying to figure out if I can convert all possible sentences that I hear into this. And I found that this is not enough. Why is this not enough  This is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation  you want to say   I don't want soup   then you can't do that by asking a question. You do that by changing the word  want.  Again  if you wanted to say   I wanted soup yesterday   you do that by converting the word  want  into  wanted.  It's a past tense. So this is a flourish which I added to make the system complete. This is a map of words joined together as questions and answers  and with these filters applied on top of them in order to modify them to represent certain nuances. Let me show you this with a different example. Let's take this sentence   I told the carpenter I could not pay him.  It's a fairly complicated sentence. The way that this particular system works  you can start with any part of this sentence. I'm going to start with the word  tell.  So this is the word  tell.  Now this happened in the past  so I'm going to make that  told.  Now  what I'm going to do is  I'm going to ask questions. So  who told  I told. I told whom  I told the carpenter. Now we start with a different part of the sentence. We start with the word  pay   and we add the ability filter to it to make it  can pay.  Then we make it  can't pay   and we can make it  couldn't pay  by making it the past tense. So who couldn't pay  I couldn't pay. Couldn't pay whom  I couldn't pay the carpenter. And then you join these two together by asking this question  What did I tell the carpenter  I told the carpenter I could not pay him. Now think about this. This is   Applause   this is a representation of this sentence without language. And there are two or three interesting things about this. First of all  I could have started anywhere. I didn't have to start with the word  tell.  I could have started anywhere in the sentence  and I could have made this entire thing. The second thing is  if I wasn't an English speaker  if I was speaking in some other language  this map would actually hold true in any language. So long as the questions are standardized  the map is actually independent of language. So I call this FreeSpeech  and I was playing with this for many  many months. I was trying out so many different combinations of this. And then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech. I was trying to convert language  convert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech  and vice versa  and back and forth. And I realized that this particular configuration  this particular way of representing language  it allowed me to actually create very concise rules that go between FreeSpeech on one side and English on the other. So I could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into English. And so I developed this thing. I developed this thing called  the FreeSpeech Engine which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input and gives out perfectly grammatical English text. And by putting these two pieces together  the representation and the engine  I was able to create an app  a technology for children with autism  that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar. So I tried this out with kids with autism  and I found that there was an  incredible amount of identification. They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in English  and I started thinking about why that might be the case. And I had an idea  and I want to  talk to you about this idea next. In about       about    years back  there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language  and they found something very interesting. They found that when you learn a language as a child  as a two year old  you learn it with a certain part of your brain  and when you learn a language as an adult    for example  if I wanted to learn Japanese right now   a completely different part of my brain is used. Now I don't know why that's the case  but my guess is that that's because when you learn a language as an adult  you almost invariably learn it through your native language  or through your first language. So what's interesting about FreeSpeech is that when you create a sentence or when you create language  a child with autism creates language with FreeSpeech  they're not using this support language  they're not using this bridge language. They're directly constructing the sentence. And so this gave me this idea. Is it possible to use FreeSpeech not for children with autism but to teach language to people without disabilities  And so I tried a number of experiments. The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes  in the form of colors  and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works. And I built an app out of it  a game out of it  in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement  a sound reinforcement of visual structures  they're able to learn language. And this  this has a lot of potential  a lot of promise  and the government of India recently licensed this technology from us  and they're going to try it out with millions of different children trying to teach them English. And the dream  the hope  the vision  really  is that when they learn English this way  they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue. All right  let's talk about something else. Let's talk about speech. This is speech. So speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us. Now what's interesting about speech is that speech is one dimensional. Why is it one dimensional  It's one dimensional because it's sound. It's also one dimensional because our mouths are built that way. Our mouths are built to create one dimensional sound. But if you think about the brain  the thoughts that we have in our heads are not one dimensional. I mean  we have these rich  complicated  multi dimensional ideas. Now  it seems to me that language is really the brain's invention to convert this rich  multi dimensional thought on one hand into speech on the other hand. Now what's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays  and almost all of that is done in the language domain. Take Google  for example. Google trawls all these countless billions of websites  all of which are in English  and when you want to use Google  you go into Google search  and you type in English  and it matches the English with the English. What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead  I have a suspicion that if we did this  we'd find that algorithms like searching  like retrieval  all of these things  are much simpler and also more effective  because they don't process the data structure of speech. Instead they're processing the data structure of thought. The data structure of thought. That's a provocative idea. But let's look at this in a little more detail. So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem. We have the Free Speech representation on one side  and we have the FreeSpeech  Engine  which generates English. Now if you think about it  FreeSpeech  I told you  is completely  language independent. It doesn't have any specific information in it which is about English. So everything that this system knows about English is actually encoded into the engine. That's a pretty interesting concept in itself. You've encoded an entire human language into a software program. But if you look at what's inside the engine  it's actually not very complicated. It's not very complicated code. And what's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really English specific. And that gives this interesting idea. It might be very easy for us to actually create these engines in many  many different languages  in Hindi  in French  in German  in Swahili. And that gives another interesting idea. For example  supposing I was a writer  say  for a newspaper or for a magazine. I could create content in one language  FreeSpeech  and the person who's consuming that content  the person who's reading that particular information could choose any engine  and they could read it in their own mother tongue  in their native language. I mean  this is an incredibly attractive idea  especially for India. We have so many different languages. There's a song about India  and there's a description of the country as  it says  That means  ever smiling speaker of beautiful languages.  Language is beautiful. I think it's the most beautiful of human creations. I think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented. It entertains  it educates  it enlightens  but what I like the most about language is that it empowers. I want to leave you with this. This is a photograph of my collaborators  my earliest collaborators when I started working on language and autism and various other things. The girl's name is Pavna  and that's her mother  Kalpana. And Pavna's an entrepreneur  but her story is much more remarkable than mine  because Pavna is about   . She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy  so ever since she was born  she could neither move nor talk. And everything that she's accomplished so far  finishing school  going to college  starting a company  collaborating with me to develop Avaz  all of these things she's done with nothing more than moving her eyes. Daniel Webster said this  He said   If all of my possessions were taken from me with one exception  I would choose to keep the power of communication  for with it  I would regain all the rest.  And that's why  of all of these incredible  applications of FreeSpeech  the one that's closest to my heart still remains the ability for this to empower children with disabilities to be able to communicate  the power of communication  to get back all the rest. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  So my moment of truth did not come all at once. In       I had the chance to be considered for promotion from my job as director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department. This was my moment to lean in  to push myself forward for what are really only a handful of the very top foreign policy jobs  and I had just finished a big     month project for Secretary Clinton  successfully  and I knew I could handle a bigger job. The woman I thought I was would have said yes. But I had been commuting for two years between Washington and Princeton  New Jersey  where my husband and my two teenage sons lived  and it was not going well. I tried on the idea of eking out another two years in Washington  or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me. But deep down  I knew that the right decision was to go home  even if I didn't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice. That was a decision based on love and responsibility. I couldn't keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being able to be there for him when and if he needed me. But the real change came more gradually. Over the next year  while my family was righting itself  I started to realize that even if I could go back into government  I didn't want to. I didn't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at home. I finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me  not what I was conditioned to want or maybe what I conditioned myself to want  and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that I grew up with and have always championed. I am still completely committed to the cause of male female equality  but let's think about what that equality really means  and how best to achieve it. I always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers  so that the measure of male female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions  prime ministers  presidents  CEOs  directors  managers  Nobel laureates  leaders. I still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal. But that's only half of real equality  and I now think we're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half. I suggest that real equality  full equality  does not just mean valuing women on male terms. It means creating a much wider range of equally respected choices for women and for men. And to get there  we have to change our workplaces  our policies and our culture. In the workplace  real equality means valuing family just as much as work  and understanding that the two reinforce each other. As a leader and as a manager  I have always acted on the mantra  if family comes first  work does not come second    life comes together. If you work for me  and you have a family issue  I expect you to attend to it  and I am confident  and my confidence has always been borne out  that the work will get done  and done better. Workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused  more efficient  more results focused. And breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts. Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents. He's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office. And caregiving itself develops patience    a lot of patience    and empathy  creativity  resilience  adaptability. Those are all attributes that are ever more important in a high speed  horizontal  networked global economy. The best companies actually know this. The companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the United States include some of our most successful corporations  and a      national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces are more engaged with their work  they're more satisfied and more loyal  they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health. And a      study of employers showed that deep  flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adaptability in a global service economy. So you may think that the privileging of work over family is only an American problem. Sadly  though  the obsession with work is no longer a uniquely American disease. Twenty years ago  when my family first started going to Italy  we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta. Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day. It's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family lunch. Now  when we go  fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta  reflecting the advance of global corporations and    hour competition. So making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative. In policy terms  real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionally done  no matter who does it. Think about it  Breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival. At least if we get beyond a barter economy  somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance for loved ones. Now most of you  when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving  instinctively translate those categories into men's work and women's work. And we don't typically challenge why men's work is advantaged. But consider a same sex couple like my friends Sarah and Emily. They're psychiatrists. They got married five years ago  and now they have two year old twins. They love being mothers  but they also love their work  and they're really good at what they do. So how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities  Should one of them stop working or reduce hours to be home  Or should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules  And what criteria should they use to make that decision  Is it who makes the most money or who is most committed to her career  Or who has the most flexible boss  The same sex perspective helps us see that juggling work and family are not women's problems  they're family problems. And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones  because they have a choice about how much they want to work. Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need  and many of those workers are scrambling. They're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe. If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal  then why shouldn't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy  The governments that get it    no surprises here    the governments that get it  Norway  Sweden  Denmark  the Netherlands  provide universal child care  support for caregivers at home  school and early childhood education  protections for pregnant women  and care for the elderly and the disabled. Those governments invest in that infrastructure the same way they invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and trains. Those societies also show you that breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other. They routinely rank among the top    countries of the most globally competitive economies  but at the same time  they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index. In fact  they rank higher than other governments  like my own  the U.S.  or Switzerland  that have higher average levels of income but lower rankings on work life balance. So changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference  but we're not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture  and the kind of cultural change required means re socializing men. Increasingly in developed countries  women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home  but men are actually still where they always were. Men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners  that to derive their self worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder. The feminist revolution still has a long way to go. It's certainly not complete. But    years after  The Feminine Mystique  was published  many women actually have more choices than men do. We can decide to be a breadwinner  a caregiver  or any combination of the two. When a man  on the other hand  decides to be a caregiver  he puts his manhood on the line. His friends may praise his decision  but underneath  they're scratching their heads. Isn't the measure of a man his willingness to compete with other men for power and prestige  And as many women hold that view as men do. We know that lots of women still judge the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career. A woman can drop out of the work force and still be an attractive partner. For a man  that's a risky proposition. So as parents and partners  we should be socializing our sons and our husbands to be whatever they want to be  either caregivers or breadwinners. We should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys. I can almost hear lots of you thinking   No way.  But in fact  the change is  actually already happening. At least in the United States  lots of men take pride in cooking  and frankly obsess over stoves. They are in the birthing rooms. They take paternity leave when they can. They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can  and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework. Indeed  there are male college students now who are starting to say   I want to be a stay at home dad.  That was completely unthinkable    or even    years ago. And in Norway  where men have an automatic three month's paternity leave  but they lose it if they decide not to take it  a high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact take their leave when they had kids. That means that it's starting to seem like a character defect not to want to be a fully engaged father. So I was raised to believe that championing women's rights meant doing everything we could to get women to the top. And I still hope that I live long enough to see men and women equally represented at all levels of the work force. But I've come to believe that we have to value family every bit as much as we value work  and that we should entertain the idea that doing right by those we love will make all of us better at everything we do. Thirty years ago  Carol Gilligan  a wonderful psychologist  studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care  an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice. It turns out that  you don't care  is just as much a part of who we are as  that's not fair.  Bill Gates agrees. He argues that the two great forces of human nature are self interest and caring for others. Let's bring them both together. Let's make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution. As whole human beings  we will be better caregivers and breadwinners. You may think that can't happen  but I grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties  where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms  and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual. Today  not so much. The revolution for human equality can happen. It is happening. It will happen. How far and how fast is up to us. Thank you. Let me start by asking you a question  just with a show of hands  Who has an iPhone  Who has an Android phone  Who has a Blackberry  Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry  And let me guess  how many of you  when you arrived here  like me  went and bought a pay as you go SIM card  Yeah  I'll bet you didn't even know you're using African technology. Pay as you go was a technology  or an idea  pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom a good    years ago  and now  like franchising  pay as you go is one of the most dominant forces of economic activity in the world. So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa  which I think is the purest form  innovation out of necessity. But first  I'm going to ask you some other questions. You don't have to put your hands up. These are rhetorical. Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent the alternating current that powers the lights in this building or the city that we're in  Why did Henry Ford have to invent the production line to produce these Fords that came in anything as long as they were black  And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos  Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like  and in the background  you can see Robben Island. This is a small dolos  and Eric Merrifield is the most famous inventor you've never heard of. In       a storm ripped up the harbor in a small South African town called East London  and while he was watching his kids playing with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse  he had the idea for this. It's a bit like a huge jumping jack  and they have used this in every harbor in the world as a breakwater. The global shipping economy would not be possible without African technology like this. So whenever you talk about Africa  you have to put up this picture of the world from space  and people go   Look  it's the Dark Continent.  Actually  it isn't. What it is is a map of innovation. And it's really easy to see where innovation's going on. All the places with lots of electricity  it isn't. And the reason it isn't is because everybody's watching television or playing Angry Birds. So where it's happening is in Africa. Now  this is real innovation  not the way people have expropriated the word to talk about launching new products. This is real innovation  and I define it as problem solving. People are solving real problems in Africa. Why  Because we have to. Because we have real problems. And when we solve real problems for people  we solve them for the rest of the world at the same time. So in California  everybody's really excited about a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone and you can swipe your credit card  and people say   We've liberated the credit card from the point of sale terminal.  Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card  In Africa  we've been doing that for years  and we've been doing it on phones like this. This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela  about an hour south of Nairobi  and the thing that's so remarkable about the payment system that's been pioneered in Africa called M Pesa is that it works on phones like this. It works on every single phone possible  because it uses SMS. You can pay bills with it   you can buy your groceries  you can pay your kids' school fees  and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials. Something like    million dollars a day is transacted through M Pesa. Forty percent of Kenya's GDP moves through M Pesa using phones like this. And you think this is just a feature phone. Actually it's the smartphone of Africa. It's also a radio  and it's also a torch  and more than anything else  it has really superb battery life. Why  Because that's what we need. We have really severe energy problems in Africa. By the way  you can update Facebook and send Gmail from a phone like this. So we have found a way to use the available technology to send money via M Pesa  which is a bit like a check system for the mobile age. I come from Johannesburg  which is a mining town. It's built on gold. This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier. And the difference today is that  the gold of today is mobile. If you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked  first came the infrastructure  then came the industry around it  the brothels    it's a bit like the Internet today  right    and everything else that worked with it  bars  saloons  etc. The gold of today is mobile  and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible. So what are some of the things that you can do with it  Well  this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana  and what you do is you take medication  something that some people might spend their entire month's salary on  and you scratch off the code  and you send that to an SMS number  and it tells you if that is legitimate or if it's expired. Really simple  really effective  really life saving. In Kenya  there's a service called iCow  which just sends you really important information about how to look after your dairy. The dairy business in Kenya is a      million business  and the difference between a subsistence farmer and an abundance farmer is only a couple of liters of milk a day. And if you can do that  you can rise out of poverty. Really simple  using a basic phone. If you don't have electricity  no problem  We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts using a windmill  as William Kamkwamba did. There's another great African that you've heard that's busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world. He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power and the electricity industry in North America  and if he's lucky  he'll get us to Mars  hopefully in my lifetime. He comes from Pretoria  the capital of  South Africa   about    kilometers from where I live. So back to Joburg  which is sometimes called Egoli  which means City of Gold. And not only is mobile the gold of today  I don't believe that the gold is under the ground. I believe we are the gold. Like you've heard the other economists say  we are at the point where China was when its boom years began  and that's where we're going. So  you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge. Well  of course it's happening at the edge  because in the middle  everybody's updating Facebook  or worse still  they're trying to understand Facebook's privacy settings. This is not that catchy catchphrase. This is innovation over the edge. So  people like to call Africa a mobile first continent  but actually it's mobile only  so while everybody else is doing all of those things  we're solving the world's problems. So there's only one thing left to say.   You're welcome    Laughter  Anyone in the room thought about sex today  Yeah  you did. Thank you for putting your hand up over there. Well  I'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams. I'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex. Now  when humans think about sex  male and female forms are generally what come to mind  but for many millions of years  such specific categories didn't even exist. Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings. It wasn't until about     million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives DNA out  and a vagina  something that receives it. Now invariably  you're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species  these very familiar structures  but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind blowing. Penile diversity is especially profuse. So this is a paper nautilus. It's a close relative of squid and octopus  and males have a hectocotylus. Just what is a hectocotylus  A detachable  swimming penis. It leaves the  body of the male   finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water  attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm. For many decades  biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether. Now  the tapir is a mammal from South America. And the tapir has a prehensile penis. It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands. And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus  not to mention it's a pretty good size. The biggest penis in the animal kingdom  however  is not that of the tapir. The biggest penis to body size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle  and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle. Mm hm.  Laughter  So with all of this diversity in structure  one might think  then  that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction. Simply insert part A into slot B  and we should all be good to go. But of course  that doesn't exactly happen  and that's because we can't just take form into account. We have to think about function as well  and when it comes to sex  function relates to the contributions made by the gametes  or the sperm and the eggs. And these contributions are far from equal. Eggs are very expensive to make  so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with. Sperm  on the other hand  is abundant and cheap  so it makes more sense for males to have a more sex is better strategy when it comes to siring members of future generations. So how do animals cope with these very incongruent needs between the sexes  I mean  if a female doesn't choose a particular male  or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough  then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things  avoiding predators  taking care of offspring  gathering and ingesting food. This is  of course  bad news for any male who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank  and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization. This is bedbug sex  and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination. Males have a spiked  barbed penis that they literally stab into the female  and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina. They stab it anywhere in her body  and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries. If a female gets too many stab wounds  or if a stab wound happens to become infected  she can actually die from it. Now if you've ever been out for a nice  peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex  you've undoubtedly been alarmed  because it looks like gang rape. And quite frankly  that's exactly what it is. A group of males will grab a female  hold her down  and ballistically ejaculate their spiral shaped penis into her corkscrew shaped vagina over and over and over again. From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second. Now the female actually gets the last laugh  though  because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries. Now  I like to share stories like this with my audiences because  yeah  we humans  we tend to think sex  sex is fun  sex is good  there's romance  and there's orgasm. But orgasm didn't actually evolve until about    million years ago with the advent of mammals. But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that. There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one's partner. Earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones. It's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different. Those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all. So going back to our biological minds  then  we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages  because she can use her time for other things  avoiding predators  taking care of young  finding and ingesting food. But biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages. Why do they do this  Well  according to the biological literature   During copulation  the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract.  Mm hm. These are Mexican guppies  and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments  and these filaments basically form a fish mustache  if you will. Now males have been observed to prod the female's genital opening prior to copulating with her  and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum  P.I. hypothesis  females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches. A little guppy porn for you right there. So we've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner. We've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex. We've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner. Now unfortunately  in the animal kingdom  it's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again. It's very common in many phyla  from invertebrates to avian species  mammals  and  of course  even in primates. Now interestingly  there  are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place. Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris  or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally  much like a penis  and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology. So before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina  she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside out it in her own body. I mean  imagine putting a penis into another penis. It's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action. Now  even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal  they're run by females  groups of females  sisters  aunts and offspring  and when young males attain sexual maturity  they're turfed out of the group. In hyena societies  adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale. They can take part in a kill only after everybody else  including the offspring. So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male  you take away all the social power he has. So what are my take home messages from my talk today  Well  sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere. The sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other  which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve. So it may not be surprising to any of you that animals  including ourselves  spend a good amount of time thinking about sex  but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it. So thank you  and happy daydreaming.   Rebecca Newberger Goldstein     Steven Pinker     The Long Reach of Reason   Cabbie  Twenty two dollars. Steven Pinker  Okay. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein  Reason  appears to have fallen on hard times  Popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth and political discourse has become a race to the bottom. We're living in an era of scientific creationism       conspiracy theories  psychic hotlines  and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism. People who think too well are often accused of elitism  and even in the academy  there are attacks on logocentrism  the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking. SP  But is this necessarily a bad thing  Perhaps reason is overrated. Many pundits have argued that a good heart and steadfast moral clarity are superior to triangulations of overeducated policy wonks  like the best and brightest and that dragged us into the quagmire of Vietnam. And wasn't it reason that gave us the means to despoil the planet and threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction  In this way of thinking   it's character and conscience  not cold hearted calculation  that will save us. Besides  a human being is not a brain on a stick. My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact. RNG  How could a reasoned argument logically entail the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments  Look  you're trying to persuade us of reason's impotence. You're not threatening us or bribing us  suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest. By the very act of trying to reason us into your position  you're conceding reason's potency. Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be. You show up for that debate and you've already lost it. SP  But can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral  After all  you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end  and the end depends on the reasoner's passions. Reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony  but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife. Can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste  RNG  All on its own  the answer is no  but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes. You need two conditions  The first is that reasoners all care about their own well being. That's one of the passions that has to be present in order for reason to go to work  and it's obviously present in all of us. We all care passionately about our own well being. The second condition is that reasoners are members of a community of reasoners who can affect one another's well being  can exchange messages  and comprehend each other's reasoning. And that's certainly true of our gregarious and loquatious species  well endowed with the instinct for language. SP  Well  that sounds good in theory  but has it worked that way in practice  In particular  can it explain a momentous historical development that I spoke about five years ago here at TED  Namely  we seem to be getting more humane. Centuries ago  our ancestors would burn cats alive as a form of popular entertainment. Knights waged constant war on each other by trying to kill as many of each other's peasants as possible. Governments executed people for frivolous reasons  like stealing a cabbage or criticizing the royal garden. The executions were designed to be as prolonged and as painful as possible  like crucifixion  disembowelment  breaking on the wheel. Respectable people kept slaves. For all our flaws  we have abandoned these barbaric practices. RNG  So  do you think it's human nature that's changed  SP  Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts that can erupt in violence  like greed  tribalism  revenge  dominance  sadism. But we also have instincts that can steer us away  like self control  empathy  a sense of fairness  what Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. RNG  So if human nature didn't change  what invigorated those better angels  SP  Well  among other things  our circle of empathy expanded. Years ago  our ancestors would feel the pain only of their family and people in their village. But with the expansion of literacy and travel  people started to sympathize with wider and wider circles  the clan  the tribe  the nation  the race  and perhaps eventually  all of humanity. RNG  Can hard headed scientists really give so much credit to soft hearted empathy  SP  They can and do. Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain that respond to other people's actions the same way they respond to our own. Empathy emerges early in life  perhaps before the age of one. Books on empathy have become bestsellers  like  The Empathic Civilization  and  The Age of Empathy.  RNG  I'm all for empathy. I mean  who isn't  But all on its own  it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress. For one thing  it's innately biased toward blood relations  babies and warm  fuzzy animals. As far as empathy is concerned  ugly outsiders can go to hell. And even our best attempts to work up sympathy for those who are unconnected with us fall miserably short  a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by Adam Smith. Adam Smith  Let us suppose that the great empire of China was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake  and let us consider how a  man of humanity in Europe would react on receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would  I imagine  first of all express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people. He would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life  and when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed  he would pursue his business or his pleasure with the same ease and tranquility as if no such accident had happened. If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow  he would not sleep tonight  but provided he never saw them  he would snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren. SP  But if empathy wasn't enough to make us more humane  what else was there  RNG  Well  you didn't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels  reason. Reason has muscle. It's reason that provides the push to widen that circle of empathy. Every one of the humanitarian developments that you mentioned originated with thinkers who gave reasons for why some practice was indefensible. They demonstrated that the way people treated some particular group of others was logically inconsistent with the way they insisted on being treated themselves. SP  Are you saying that reason can actually change people's minds  Don't people just stick with whatever conviction serves their interests or conforms to the culture that they grew up in  RNG  Here's a fascinating fact about us  Contradictions bother us  at least when we're forced to confront them  which is just another way of saying that we are susceptible to reason. And if you look at the history of moral progress  you can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments to changes in the way that we actually feel. Time and again  a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible  irrational  inconsistent with values already held. Their essay would go viral  get translated into many languages  get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons  and at dinner parties  and influence leaders  legislators  popular opinion. Eventually their conclusions get absorbed into the common sense of decency  erasing the tracks of the original argument that had gotten us there. Few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hangings or beating children. By now  these things just feel wrong. But just those arguments had to be made  and they were  in centuries past. SP  Are you saying that people needed a step by step argument to grasp why something might be a wee bit wrong with burning heretics at the stake  RNG  Oh  they did. Here's the French theologian Sebastian Castellio making the case. Sebastian Castellio  Calvin says that he's certain  and other sects say that they are. Who shall be judge  If the matter is certain  to whom is it so  To Calvin  But then  why does he write so many books about manifest truth  In view of the uncertainty  we must define heretics simply as one with whom we disagree. And if then we are going to kill heretics  the logical outcome will be a war of extermination  since each is sure of himself. SP  Or with hideous punishments like breaking on the wheel  RNG  The prohibition in our constitution of cruel and unusual punishments was a response to a pamphlet circulated in      by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria. Cesare Beccaria  As punishments become more cruel  the minds of men  which like fluids always adjust to the level of the objects that surround them  become hardened  and after a hundred years of cruel punishments  breaking on the wheel causes no more fear than imprisonment previously did. For a punishment to achieve its objective  it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime  and into this calculation ought to be factored the certainty of punishment and the loss of the good that the commission of the crime will produce. Everything beyond this is superfluous  and therefore tyrannical. SP  But surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war. RNG  No doubt  but modern anti war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war  such as the father of modernity  Erasmus. Erasmus  The advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide  and reach great numbers  while in war  if anything turns out happily  the advantage redounds only to a few  and those unworthy of reaping it. One man's safety is owing to the destruction of another. One man's prize is derived from the plunder of another. The cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning. Whatever is unfortunate in war  is severely so indeed  and whatever  on the contrary  is called good fortune  is a savage and a cruel good fortune  an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another's woe. SP  But everyone knows that the movement to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion. It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers  and it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel  Uncle Tom's Cabin  became a bestseller. RNG  But the ball got rolling a century before. John Locke bucked the tide of millennia that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural. He argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government. John Locke  Freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by common to everyone of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it  a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribes not  not to be subject to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of another man  as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. SP  Those words sound familiar. Where have I read them before  Ah  yes. Mary Astell  If absolute sovereignty  be not necessary in a state  how comes it to be so in a family  Or if in a family  why not in a state  Since no reason can be alleged for the one that will not hold more strongly for the other  if all men are born free  how is it that all women are born slaves  as they must be if being subjected to the inconstant  uncertain  unknown  arbitrary will of men be the perfect condition of slavery  RNG  That sort of co option is all in the job description of reason. One movement for the expansion of rights inspires another because the logic is the same  and once that's hammered home  it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to ignore the inconsistency. In the     s  the Civil Rights Movement inspired the movements for women's rights  children's rights  gay rights and even animal rights. But fully two centuries before  the Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham had exposed the indefensibility of customary practices such as the cruelty to animals. Jeremy Bentham  The question is not  can they reason  nor can they talk  but can they suffer  RNG  And the persecution of homosexuals. JB  As to any primary mischief  it's evident that it produces no pain in anyone. On the contrary  it produces pleasure. The partners are both willing. If either of them be unwilling  the act is an offense  totally different in its nature of effects. It's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape. As to the any danger exclusive of pain  the danger  if any  much consist in the tendency of the example. But what is the tendency of this example  To dispose others to engage in the same practices. But this practice produces not pain of any kind to anyone. SP  Still  in every case  it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole. It kind of makes you wonder about our own time. Are there practices that we engage in where the arguments against them are there for all to see but nonetheless we persist in them  RNG  When our great grandchildren look back at us  will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our slave owning  heretic burning  wife beating  gay bashing ancestors  SP  I'm sure everyone here could think of an example. RNG  I opt for the mistreatment of animals in factory farms. SP  The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons. RNG  Scrimping on donations to life saving charities in the developing world. SP  The possession of nuclear weapons. RNG  The appeal to religion to justify the otherwise unjustifiable  such as the ban on contraception. SP  What about religious faith in general  RNG  Eh  I'm not holding my breath. SP  Still  I have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future. RNG  And if  our friends  you detect a flaw in this argument  just remember you'll be depending on reason to point it out. Thank you. SP  Thank you. I'd like to talk today about how we can change our brains and our society. Meet Joe. Joe's    years old and a murderer. I met Joe    years ago on the lifer wing at Wormwood Scrubs high security prison in London. I'd like you to imagine this place. It looks and feels like it sounds  Wormwood Scrubs. Built at the end of the Victorian Era by the inmates themselves  it is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept. These individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil. And I was there to study their brains. I was part of a team of researchers from University College London  on a grant from the U.K. department of health. My task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths. That meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population. What lay at the root of their behavior  Was there a neurological cause for their condition  And if there was a neurological cause  could we find a cure  So I'd like to speak about change  and  especially about emotional change. Growing up  I was always intrigued by how people change. My mother  a clinical psychotherapist  would occasionally see patients at home in the evening. She would shut the door to the living room  and I imagined magical things happened in that room. At the age of five or six I would creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door. On more than one occasion  I fell asleep and they had to push me out of the way at the end of the session. And I suppose that's how I found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs. Joe sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression. The prison warden  looking equally indifferent  said   Any trouble  just press the red buzzer  and we'll be around as soon as we can.  I sat down. The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me. I looked up at the red buzzer far behind Joe on the opposite wall. I looked at Joe. Perhaps detecting my concern  he leaned forward  and said  as reassuringly as he could   Ah  don't worry about the buzzer  it doesn't work anyway.  Over the subsequent months  we tested Joe and his fellow inmates  looking specifically at their ability to categorize different images of emotion. And we looked at their physical response to those emotions. So  for example  when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad  we instantly have a slight  measurable physical response  increased heart rate  sweating of the skin. Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately  they failed to show the emotions required. They failed to show a physical response. It was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy. So we wanted to look closer at this to use MRI to image their brains. That turned out to be not such an easy task. Imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central London in shackles and handcuffs in rush hour  and in order to place each of them in an MRI scanner  you have to remove all metal objects  including shackles and handcuffs  and  as I learned  all body piercings. After some time  however  we had a tentative answer. These individuals were not just the victims of a troubled childhood. There was something else. People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala. The amygdala is an almond shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain. It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy. Normally  the more empathic a person is  the larger and more active their amygdala is. Our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala  which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior. So let's take a step back. Normally  acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up  like learning to speak. At the age of six months  virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects. At the age of    months  most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others. So for example  your mother raises her hands to stretch  and you imitate her behavior. At first  this isn't perfect. I remember my cousin Sasha  two years old at the time  looking through a picture book and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand  licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand. Bit by bit  we build the foundations  of the social brain so that by the time we're three  four years old  most children  not all  have acquired the ability to understand the intentions of others  another prerequisite for empathy. The fact that this developmental progression is universal  irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit  strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn. If you doubt this  try  as I've done  to renege on a promise you've made to a four year old. You will find that the mind of a four year old is not na ve in the slightest. It is more akin to a Swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness. The early years are crucial. There seems to be a window of opportunity  after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult  like adults learning a foreign language. That's not to say it's impossible. A recent  wonderful study from Stanford University showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero actually became more caring and helpful towards others afterwards. Now I'm not suggesting we endow criminals with superpowers  but I am suggesting that we need to find ways to get Joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior  for their benefit and for the benefit of the rest of us. So can brains change  For over     years  neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood  no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain. The brain could only change within certain set limits. That was the dogma. But then  in the     s  studies starting showing  following the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others  studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis  the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian brain  first in the olfactory bulb  which is responsible for our sense of smell  then in the hippocampus involving short term memory  and finally in the amygdala itself. In order to understand how this process works  I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford specializing in learning and development. Instead of psychopaths  I studied mice  because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals. So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage  a shoebox  essentially  with cotton wool  alone and without much stimulation  not only does it not thrive  but it will often develop strange  repetitive behaviors. This naturally sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice  even becoming aggressive when introduced to them. However  mice reared in what we called an enriched environment  a large habitation with other mice with wheels and ladders and areas to explore  demonstrate neurogenesis  the birth of new brain cells  and as we showed  they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks. Now  they don't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street  but their improved environment results in healthy  sociable behavior. Mice reared in a standard cage  by contrast  not dissimilar  you might say  from a prison cell  have dramatically lower levels of new neurons in the brain. It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals  including primates like us  can show neurogenesis. In some areas of the brain  more than    percent of cells are newly formed. We're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have  but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood. However  our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment. Stress hormones  glucocorticoids  released by the brain  suppress the growth of these new cells. The more stress  the less brain development  which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels. This is the interplay between nature and nurture in real time in front of our eyes. When you think about it  it is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth. Of course  imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society. Our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their MRI scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala. The evidence is actually the other way. Because our brains are capable of change  we need to take responsibility for our actions  and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation. One way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs. Here victims  if they choose to participate  and perpetrators meet face to face in safe  structured encounters  and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions  and the victim plays an active role in the process. In such a setting  the perpetrator can see  perhaps for the first time  the victim as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response. This stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration. Such programs won't work for everyone  but for many  it could be a way to break the frozen sea within. So what can we do now  How can we apply this knowledge  I'd like to leave you with three lessons that I learned. The first thing that I learned was that we need to change our mindset. Since Wormwood Scrubs was built     years ago  society has advanced in virtually every aspect  in the way we run our schools  our hospitals. Yet the moment we speak about prisons  it's as though we're back in Dickensian times  if not medieval times. For too long  I believe  we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human  nature cannot change  and as a society  it's costing us dearly. We know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change  and the best way to achieve that  even in adults  is to change and modulate our environment. The second thing I have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral to bringing about social change. It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place a high security inmate in an MRI scanner. Well actually  that turns out not to be so easy  but ultimately what we want to show is whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates. In order to answer complex questions like that  we need people of different backgrounds    lab based scientists and clinicians  social workers and policy makers  philanthropists and human rights activists   to work together. Finally  I believe we need to change our own amygdalae  because this issue goes to the heart not just of who Joe is  but who we are. We need to change our view of Joe as someone wholly irredeemable  because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable  how is he going to see himself as any different  In another decade  Joe will be released from Wormwood Scrubs. Will he be among the    percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system  Wouldn't it be better if  while serving his sentence  Joe was able to train his amygdala  which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections  so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released  Surely  that would be in the interest of all of us. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  The rights of citizens  the future of the Internet. So I would like to welcome to the TED stage the man behind those revelations  Ed Snowden. Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia controlling this bot from his laptop  so he can see what the bot can see. Ed  welcome to the TED stage. What can you see  as a matter of fact  Edward Snowden  Ha  I can see everyone. This is amazing. CA  Ed  some questions for you. You've been called many things in the last few months. You've been called a whistleblower  a traitor  a hero. What words would you describe yourself with  ES  You know  everybody who is involved with this debate has been struggling over me and my personality and how to describe me. But when I think about it  this isn't the question that we should be struggling with. Who I am really doesn't matter at all. If I'm the worst person in the world  you can hate me and move on. What really matters here are the issues. What really matters here is the kind of government we want  the kind of Internet we want  the kind of relationship between people and societies. And that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards  and we've seen that increasing over time. If I had to describe myself  I wouldn't use words like  hero.  I wouldn't use  patriot   and I wouldn't use  traitor.  I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen  just like everyone else. CA  So just to give some context for those who don't know the whole story    this time a year ago  you were stationed in Hawaii working as a consultant to the NSA. As a sysadmin  you had access to their systems  and you began revealing certain classified documents to some handpicked journalists leading the way to June's revelations. Now  what propelled you to do this  ES  You know  when I was sitting in Hawaii  and the years before  when I was working in the intelligence community  I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me. We do a lot of good things in the intelligence community  things that need to be done  and things that help everyone. But there are also things that go too far. There are things that shouldn't be done  and decisions that were being made in secret without the public's awareness  without the public's consent  and without even our representatives in government having knowledge of these programs. When I really came to struggle with these issues  I thought to myself  how can I do this in the most responsible way  that maximizes the public benefit while minimizing the risks  And out of all the solutions that I could come up with  out of going to Congress  when there were no laws  there were no legal protections for a private employee  a contractor in intelligence like myself  there was a risk that I would be buried along with the information and the public would never find out. But the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees us a free press for a reason  and that's to enable an adversarial press  to challenge the government  but also to work together with the government  to have a dialogue and debate about how we can inform the public about matters of vital importance without putting our national security at risk. And by working with journalists  by giving all of my information back to the American people  rather than trusting myself to make the decisions about publication  we've had a robust debate with a deep investment by the government that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone. And the risks that have been threatened  the risks that have been played up by the government have never materialized. We've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm  and because of that  I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made. CA  So let me show the audience a couple of examples of what you revealed. If we could have a slide up  and Ed  I don't know whether you can see  the slides are here. This is a slide of the PRISM program  and maybe you could tell the audience what that was that was revealed. ES  The best way to understand PRISM  because there's been a little bit of controversy  is to first talk about what PRISM isn't. Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata. They've said it's just metadata  it's just metadata  and they're talking about a specific legal authority called Section     of the Patriot Act. That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping  mass surveillance of the entire country's phone records  things like that    who you're talking to  when you're talking to them  where you traveled. These are all metadata events. PRISM is about content. It's a program through which the government could compel corporate America  it could deputize corporate America to do its dirty work for the NSA. And even though some of these companies did resist  even though some of them    I believe Yahoo was one of them   challenged them in court  they all lost  because it was never tried by an open court. They were only tried by a secret court. And something that we've seen  something about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is  there's been a talking point in the U.S. government where they've said    federal judges have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful  but what they don't tell you is those are secret judges in a secret court based on secret interpretations of law that's considered        warrant requests over    years  and in    years only rejected    government requests. These aren't the people that we want deciding what the role of corporate America in a free and open Internet should be. CA  Now  this slide that we're showing here shows the dates in which different technology companies  Internet companies  are alleged to have joined the program  and where data collection began from them. Now  they have denied collaborating with the NSA. How was that data collected by the NSA  ES  Right. So the NSA's own slides refer to it as direct access. What that means to an actual NSA analyst  someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst targeting  Chinese cyber hackers  things like that  in Hawaii  is the provenance of that data is directly from their servers. It doesn't mean that there's a group of company representatives sitting in a smoky room with the NSA palling around and making back room deals about how they're going to give this stuff away. Now each company handles it different ways. Some are responsible. Some are somewhat less responsible. But the bottom line is  when we talk about how this information is given  it's coming from the companies themselves. It's not stolen from the lines. But there's an important thing to remember here  even though companies pushed back  even though companies demanded  hey  let's do this through a warrant process  let's do this where we actually have some sort of legal review  some sort of basis for handing over these users' data  we saw stories in the Washington Post last year that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story that said the NSA broke in to the data center communications between Google to itself and Yahoo to itself. So even these companies that are cooperating in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner with the NSA  the NSA isn't satisfied with that  and because of that  we need our companies to work very hard to guarantee that they're going to represent the interests of the user  and also advocate for the rights of the users. And I think over the last year  we've seen the companies that are named on the PRISM slides take great strides to do that  and I encourage them to continue. CA  What more should they do  ES  The biggest thing that an Internet company in America can do today  right now  without consulting with lawyers  to protect the rights of users worldwide  is to enable SSL web encryption on every page you visit. The reason this matters is today  if you go to look at a copy of        on Amazon.com  the NSA can see a record of that  the Russian intelligence service can see a record of that  the Chinese service can see a record of that  the French service  the German service  the services of Andorra. They can all see it because it's unencrypted. The world's library is Amazon.com  but not only do they not support encryption by default  you cannot choose to use encryption when browsing through books. This is something that we need to change  not just for Amazon  I don't mean to single them out  but they're a great example. All companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default for all users who haven't taken any action or picked any special methods on their own. That'll increase the privacy and the rights that people enjoy worldwide. CA  Ed  come with me to this part of the stage. I want to show you the next slide here.  Applause  This is a program called Boundless Informant. What is that  ES  So  I've got to give credit to the NSA for using appropriate names on this. This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms. Boundless Informant is a program that the NSA hid from Congress. The NSA was previously asked by Congress  was there any ability that they had to even give a rough ballpark estimate of the amount of American communications that were being intercepted. They said no. They said  we don't track those stats  and we can't track those stats. We can't tell you how many communications we're intercepting around the world  because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy. Now  I really appreciate that sentiment from them  but the reality  when you look at this slide is  not only do they have the capability  the capability already exists. It's already in place. The NSA has its own internal data format that tracks both ends of a communication  and if it says  this communication came from America  they can tell Congress how many of those communications they have today  right now. And what Boundless Informant tells us is more communications are being intercepted in America about Americans than there are in Russia about Russians. I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency should be aiming for. CA  Ed  there was a story broken in the Washington Post  again from your data. The headline says   NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year.  Tell us about that. ES  We also heard in Congressional testimony last year  it was an amazing thing for someone like me who came from the NSA and who's seen the actual internal documents  knows what's in them  to see officials testifying under oath that there had been no abuses  that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules  when we knew this story was coming. But what's especially interesting about this  about the fact that the NSA has violated their own rules  their own laws thousands of times in a single year  including one event by itself  one event out of those        that affected more than       people. In another event  they intercepted all the calls in Washington  D.C.  by accident. What's amazing about this  this report  that didn't get that much attention  is the fact that not only were there       abuses  the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee  Dianne Feinstein  had not seen this report until the Washington Post contacted her asking for comment on the report. And she then requested a copy from the NSA and received it  but had never seen this before that. What does that say about the state of oversight in American intelligence when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has no idea that the rules are being broken thousands of times every year  CA  Ed  one response to this whole debate is this  Why should we care about all this surveillance  honestly  I mean  look  if you've done nothing wrong  you've got nothing to worry about. What's wrong with that point of view  ES  Well  so the first thing is  you're giving up your rights. You're saying hey  you know  I don't think I'm going to need them  so I'm just going to trust that  you know  let's get rid of them  it doesn't really matter  these guys are going to do the right thing. Your rights matter because you never know when you're going to need them. Beyond that  it's a part of our cultural identity  not just in America  but in Western societies and in democratic societies around the world. People should be able to pick up the phone and to call their family  people should be able to send a text message to their loved ones  people should be able to buy a book online  they should be able to travel by train  they should be able to buy an airline ticket without wondering about how these events are going to look to an agent of the government  possibly not even your government years in the future  how they're going to be misinterpreted and what they're going to think your intentions were. We have a right to privacy. We require warrants to be based on probable cause or some kind of individualized suspicion because we recognize that trusting anybody  any government authority  with the entirety of human communications in secret and without oversight is simply too great a temptation to be ignored. CA  Some people are furious at what you've done. I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite  Edward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog. He thinks you've committed one of the worst acts of betrayal in American history. What would you say to people who think that  ES  Dick Cheney's really something else. Thank you.  Laughter  I think it's amazing  because at the time Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work  Dick Cheney was saying he was going to end governments worldwide  the skies were going to ignite and the seas were going to boil off  and now he's saying it's a flea bite. So we should be suspicious about the same sort of overblown claims of damage to national security from these kind of officials. But let's assume that these people really believe this. I would argue that they have kind of a narrow conception of national security. The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney do not keep the nation safe. The public interest is not always the same as the national interest. Going to war with people who are not our enemy in places that are not a threat doesn't make us safe  and that applies whether it's in Iraq or on the Internet. The Internet is not the enemy. Our economy is not the enemy. American businesses  Chinese businesses  and any other company out there is a part of our society. It's a part of our interconnected world. There are ties of fraternity that bond us together  and if we destroy these bonds by undermining the standards  the security  the manner of behavior  that nations and citizens all around the world expect us to abide by. CA  But it's alleged that you've stolen  .  million documents. It seems only a few hundred of them have been shared with journalists so far. Are there more revelations to come  ES  There are absolutely more revelations to come. I don't think there's any question that some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come. CA  Come here  because I want to ask you about this particular revelation. Come and take a look at this. I mean  this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room is the single most shocking thing that they have heard in the last few months. It's about a program called  Bullrun.  Can you explain what that is  ES  So Bullrun  and this is again where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor  this is a program named after a Civil War battle. The British counterpart is called Edgehill  which is a U.K. civil war battle. And the reason that I believe they're named this way is because they target our own infrastructure. They're programs through which the NSA intentionally misleads corporate partners. They tell corporate partners that these are safe standards. They say hey  we need to work with you to secure your systems  but in reality  they're giving bad advice to these companies that makes them degrade the security of their services. They're building in backdoors that not only the NSA can exploit  but anyone else who has time and money to research and find it can then use to let themselves in to the world's communications. And this is really dangerous  because if we lose a single standard  if we lose the trust of something like SSL  which was specifically targeted by the Bullrun program  we will live a less safe world overall. We won't be able to access our banks and we won't be able to access commerce without worrying about people monitoring those communications or subverting them for their own ends. CA  And do those same decisions also potentially open America up to cyberattacks from other sources  ES  Absolutely. One of the problems  one of the dangerous legacies that we've seen in the post      era  is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats. They've been in charge of offensive operations  that is hacking  but they've also been in charge of defensive operations  and traditionally they've always prioritized defense over offense based on the principle that American secrets are simply worth more. If we hack a Chinese business and steal their secrets  if we hack a government office in Berlin and steal their secrets  that has less value to the American people than making sure that the Chinese can't get access to our secrets. So by reducing the security of our communications  they're not only putting the world at risk  they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way  because intellectual property is the basis  the foundation of our economy  and if we put that at risk through weak security  we're going to be paying for it for years. CA  But they've made a calculation that it was worth doing this as part of America's defense against terrorism. Surely that makes it a price worth paying. ES  Well  when you look at the results of these programs in stopping terrorism  you will see that that's unfounded  and you don't have to take my word for it  because we've had the first open court  the first federal court that's reviewed this  outside the secrecy arrangement  called these programs Orwellian and likely unconstitutional. Congress  who has access to be briefed on these things  and now has the desire to be  has produced bills to reform it  and two independent White House panels who reviewed all of the classified evidence said these programs have never stopped a single terrorist attack that was imminent in the United States. So is it really terrorism that we're stopping  Do these programs have any value at all  I say no  and all three branches of the American government say no as well. CA  I mean  do you think there's a deeper motivation for them than the war against terrorism  ES  I'm sorry  I couldn't hear you  say again  CA  Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation for them other than the war against terrorism  ES  Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism has always been what we in the intelligence world would call a cover for action. Terrorism is something that provokes an emotional response that allows people to rationalize authorizing powers and programs that they wouldn't give otherwise. The Bullrun and Edgehill type programs  the NSA asked for these authorities back in the     s. They asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case. The FBI went to Congress and did make the case. But Congress and the American people said no. They said  it's not worth the risk to our economy. They said it's worth too much damage to our society to justify the gains. But what we saw is  in the post      era  they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism to start these programs in secret without asking Congress  without asking the American people  and it's that kind of government behind closed doors that we need to guard ourselves against  because it makes us less safe  and it offers no value. CA  Okay  come with me here for a sec  because I've got a more personal question for you. Speaking of terror  most people would find the situation you're in right now in Russia pretty terrifying. You obviously heard what happened  what the treatment that Bradley Manning got  Chelsea Manning as now is  and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that there are people in the intelligence community who want you dead. How are you coping with this  How are you coping with the fear  ES  It's no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead. I've made clear again and again and again that I go to sleep every morning thinking about what I can do for the American people. I don't want to harm my government. I want to help my government  but the fact that they are willing to completely ignore due process  they're willing to declare guilt without ever seeing a trial  these are things that we need to work against as a society  and say hey  this is not appropriate. We shouldn't be threatening dissidents. We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism. And whatever part I can do to see that end  I'm happy to do despite the risks. CA  So I'd actually like to get some feedback from the audience here  because I know there's widely differing reactions to Edward Snowden. Suppose you had the following two choices  right  You could view what he did as fundamentally a reckless act that has endangered America or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act that will work towards America and the world's long term good  Those are the two choices I'll give you. I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with the first of those  that this was a reckless act  There are some hands going up. Some hands going up. It's hard to put your hand up when the man is standing right here  but I see them. ES  I can see you.  Laughter  CA  And who goes with the second choice  the fundamentally heroic act  And I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people who didn't show a hand and I think are still thinking this through  because it seems to me that the debate around you doesn't split along traditional political lines. It's not left or right  it's not really about pro government  libertarian  or not just that. Part of it is almost a generational issue. You're part of a generation that grew up with the Internet  and it seems as if you become offended at almost a visceral level when you see something done that you think will harm the Internet. Is there some truth to that  ES  It is. I think it's very true. This is not a left or right issue. Our basic freedoms  and when I say our  I don't just mean Americans  I mean people around the world  it's not a partisan issue. These are things that all people believe  and it's up to all of us to protect them  and to people who have seen and enjoyed a free and open Internet  it's up to us to preserve that liberty for the next generation to enjoy  and if we don't change things  if we don't stand up to make the changes we need to do to keep the Internet safe  not just for us but for everyone  we're going to lose that  and that would be a tremendous loss  not just for us  but for the world. CA  Well  I have heard similar language recently from the founder of the world wide web  who I actually think is with us  Sir Tim Berners Lee. Tim  actually  would you like to come up and say  do we have a microphone for Tim  Tim  good to see you. Come up there. Which camp are you in  by the way  traitor  hero  I have a theory on this  but    Tim Berners Lee  I've given much longer answers to that question  but hero  if I have to make the choice between the two. CA  And Ed  I think you've read the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet. Is that something that makes sense  ES  Absolutely. I mean  my generation  I grew up not just thinking about the Internet  but I grew up in the Internet  and although I never expected to have the chance to defend it in such a direct and practical manner and to embody it in this unusual  almost avatar manner  I think there's something poetic about the fact that one of the sons of the Internet has actually become close to the Internet as a result of their political expression. And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet is exactly what we need. We need to encode our values not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet  and it's something that I hope  I invite everyone in the audience  not just here in Vancouver but around the world  to join and participate in. CA  Do you have a question for Ed  TBL  Well  two questions  a general question   CA  Ed  can you still hear us  ES  Yes  I can hear you. CA  Oh  he's back. TBL  The wiretap on your line got a little interfered with for a moment. ES  It's a little bit of an NSA problem. TBL  So  from the    years  stepping back and thinking  what would you think would be the best that we could achieve from all the discussions that we have about the web we want  ES  When we think about in terms of how far we can go  I think that's a question that's really only limited by what we're willing to put into it. I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past has been exactly what we as not just a nation but as a people around the world need  and by cooperating  by engaging not just the technical parts of society  but as you said  the users  the people around the world who contribute through the Internet  through social media  who just check the weather  who rely on it every day as a part of their life  to champion that. We'll get not just the Internet we've had  but a better Internet  a better now  something that we can use to build a future that'll be better not just than what we hoped for but anything that we could have imagined. CA  It's    years ago that TED was founded      . A lot of the conversation since then has been along the lines that actually George Orwell got it wrong. It's not Big Brother watching us. We  through the power of the web  and transparency  are now watching Big Brother. Your revelations kind of drove a stake through the heart of that rather optimistic view  but you still believe there's a way of doing something about that. And you do too. ES  Right  so there is an argument to be made that the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously. There was a recent legal article at Yale that established something called the Bankston Soltani Principle  which is that our expectation of privacy is violated when the capabilities of government surveillance have become cheaper by an order of magnitude  and each time that occurs  we need to revisit and rebalance our privacy rights. Now  that hasn't happened since the government's surveillance powers have increased by several orders of magnitude  and that's why we're in the problem that we're in today  but there is still hope  because the power of individuals have also been increased by technology. I am living proof that an individual can go head to head against the most powerful adversaries and the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win  and I think that's something that we need to take hope from  and we need to build on to make it accessible not just to technical experts but to ordinary citizens around the world. Journalism is not a crime  communication is not a crime  and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities. CA  I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot  but I imagine it's  this is the hand right here. TBL  That'll come very soon. ES  Nice to meet you  and I hope my beam looks as nice as my view of you guys does. CA  Thank you  Tim. I mean  The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you. Would you welcome the chance to come back to America  ES  Absolutely. There's really no question  the principles that have been the foundation of this project have been the public interest and the principles that underly the journalistic establishment in the United States and around the world  and I think if the press is now saying  we support this  this is something that needed to happen  that's a powerful argument  but it's not the final argument  and I think that's something that public should decide. But at the same time  the government has hinted that they want some kind of deal  that they want me to compromise the journalists with which I've been working  to come back  and I want to make it very clear that I did not do this to be safe. I did this to do what was right  and I'm not going to stop my work in the public interest just to benefit myself. CA  In the meantime  courtesy of the Internet and this technology  you're here  back in North America  not quite the U.S.  Canada  in this form. I'm curious  how does that feel  ES  Canada is different than what I expected. It's a lot warmer. CA  At TED  the mission is  ideas worth spreading.  If you could encapsulate it in a single idea  what is your idea worth spreading right now at this moment  ES  I would say the last year has been a reminder that democracy may die behind closed doors  but we as individuals are born behind those same closed doors  and we don't have to give up our privacy to have good government. We don't have to give up our liberty to have security. And I think by working together we can have both open government and private lives  and I look forward to working with everyone around the world to see that happen. Thank you very much. CA  Ed  thank you. What's the scariest thing you've ever done  Or another way to say it is  what's the most dangerous  thing that you've ever done  And why did you do it  I know what the most dangerous thing is that I've ever done because NASA does the math. You look back to the first five shuttle launches  the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine. And even when I first flew in the shuttle back in          shuttle flight  the odds were still now that we look back about one in    or so    one in     one in   . Not great odds  so it's a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you're going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you're either going to be floating  effortlessly  gloriously in space  or you'll be dead. You go into  at the Kennedy Space Center  the suit up room  the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in  that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon. And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad    in the Astro van    heading out to the launchpad  and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center  it's normally predawn  and in the distance  lit up by the huge xenon lights  is your spaceship    the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet. The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed  almost holding hands  looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger. We ride the elevator up and we crawl in  on your hands and knees into the spaceship  one at a time  and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back. And the hatch is closed  and suddenly  what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real  something that I dreamed about  in fact  that I chose to do when I was nine years old  is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening. In the astronaut business    the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle  it's the most complicated flying machine ever built. And in the astronaut business   we have a saying  which is  there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse. And so you're very conscious in the cockpit  you're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do  all the switches and all the  wickets you have to go through. And as the time gets closer and closer  this excitement is building. And then about three and a  half minutes before launch  the huge nozzles on the back  like the size of big church bells  swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle  like the vehicle is alive underneath you  like an elephant getting up  off its knees or something. And then about    seconds before launch  the vehicle is completely alive    it is ready to go    the APUs are running  the computers are all self contained  it's ready to leave the planet. And    seconds before launch  this happens  nine  eight  seven  six       start  two  one  booster ignition  and liftoff of  the space shuttle Discovery  returning to the space station  paving the way ... Chris Hadfield  It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things. You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself. It's shaking you so hard you can't focus on the instruments in front of you. It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there's a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space  accelerating wildly straight up  shouldering your way through the air  and you're in a very complex place    paying attention  watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face. After two minutes  those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines  the hydrogen and oxygen  and it's as if you're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you've never accelerated. You get lighter and lighter  the force gets on us heavier and heavier. It feels like someone's pouring cement on you or something. Until finally  after about eight minutes and    seconds or so  we are finally at exactly the right altitude  exactly the right speed  the right direction  the engine shut off  and we're weightless. And we're alive. It's an amazing experience. But why would we take that risk  Why would you do something that dangerous  In my case the answer is fairly straightforward. I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do. I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me  it was just an obvious thing    I want to somehow turn myself into that. But the real question is  how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it  How do you deal with fear versus danger  And having the goal in mind  thinking about where it might lead  directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible  to be able to launch and go  help build a space station where you are on board a million pound creation that's going around the world at five miles a second  eight kilometers a second  around the world    times a day  with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running     experiments inside. But maybe even more importantly  allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means  to be able to look down and have    if your jaw could drop  it would    the jaw dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self propelled art gallery of fantastic  constantly changing beauty that is the world itself. And you see  because of the speed  a sunrise or a sunset every    minutes for half a year. And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk. You are in a one person spaceship that is your spacesuit  and you're going through space with the world. It's an entirely different perspective  you're not looking up at the universe  you and the Earth are going  through the universe together. And you're holding on with one hand  looking at the world turn beside you. It's roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you. And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything  it's unfathomable blackness  with a texture you feel like you  could stick your hand into. and you are holding on with one hand  one link to the other seven billion people. And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind  and I didn't know why. Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working. I was thinking  what do I do next  I thought  well maybe that's why we have two eyes  so I kept working. But unfortunately  without gravity  tears don't fall. So you just get a bigger and  bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually  the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it  across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes  goosh  into your other eye  and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship. So what's the scariest thing you've ever done  Maybe it's spiders. A lot of people are afraid of spiders. I think you should be afraid of spiders    spiders are creepy and they've got long  hairy legs  and spiders like this one  the brown recluse    it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you  you end with one of these  horrible  big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you  in fact. And how do you know  And so a spider lands on you  and you go through this great  spasmy attack because spiders are scary. But then you could say  well  is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not  I don't know. Are there brown recluses here  So if you actually do the research  you find out that in the world there are about         different types of spiders  and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of       . And if you're in Canada  because of the cold winters here in B.C.  there's about           different types of spiders and there's one    one    that is venomous  and its venom isn't even fatal  it's just kind of like a nasty sting. And that spider    not only that  but that spider has beautiful markings on it  it's like  I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation  symbol on my back  it's the black widow.  So  if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider    and it lives close the ground  you're walking along  you are  never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you. Spider webs like this  it doesn't build those  it builds them down in the corners. And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male  it doesn't care about you. So in fact  the next time you walk into a spiderweb  you don't need to panic and go  with your caveman reaction. The danger is entirely different than the fear. How do you get around it  though  How do you change your behavior  Well  next time you see a spiderweb  have a good look  make sure  it's not a black widow spider  and then walk into it. And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one. It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal. And the spider that may come out is  no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly. And then I guarantee you if you  walk through     spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior  your caveman reaction  and you will now be able to walk  in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb    or into your grandma's attic or whatever  into your own basement. And you can apply this to anything. If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded  your natural reaction would be to panic  I think. It would make you nervous and worried. But we had considered all the venom  and we had practiced with a whole  variety of different spiderwebs. We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times. And we don't just practice things going right  we practice things going wrong all the time  so that you are constantly walking  through those spiderwebs. And not just underwater  but  also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it's realistic. So when you finally actually  get outside on a spacewalk  it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time. And even if you're blinded  your natural  panicky reaction doesn't happen. Instead you kind of look around and go   Okay  I can't see  but I can hear  I can talk  Scott Parazynski is out here with me. He could come over and help me.  We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue  so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to. I could find my own way back. It's not nearly as big a deal. And actually  if you keep on crying for a while  whatever that gunk was that's  in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again  and Houston  if you negotiate with them  they will let you then keep working. We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside  Jeff got some cotton batting and took  the crusty stuff around my eyes  and it turned out it was just the anti fog  sort of a mixture of oil and soap  that got in my eye. And now we use Johnson's No More Tears  which we probably should've been using right from the very beginning.  Laughter  But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger  where is the real risk  What is the real thing that you should be afraid of  Not just a generic fear of bad things happening. You can fundamentally change  your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you ... where you could see the  hardpan south of the Sahara  or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike  or the unconscious gingham  of Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles. You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge  just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear. You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened. It's time to come home at the end. This is our spaceship  the Soyuz  that little one. Three of us climb in  and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere. These two parts here actually melt  we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere. The only part that survives is the little bullet that we're riding in  and it falls into the atmosphere  and in essence you are riding a meteorite home  and riding meteorites is scary  and it ought to be. But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming  like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth     Laughter     instead     years previously we had started studying Russian  and then once you learn Russian  then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian  and then we learned vehicle control theory  and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again. And in fact  you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a    kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth. So in fact  when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz  we weren't screaming  we were laughing  it was fun. And when the great big parachute opened  we knew that if it didn't open there's a second parachute  and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism. So we came back  we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz  in Kazakhstan. search and recovery helicopters  once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi   helicopters. Touchdown         and    seconds  a.m. Central Time. CH  And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your  spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end  but you're ready for it you're in a custom built seat  you know how the shock absorber works. And then eventually the Russians reach in  drag you out  plunk you into a chair  and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience. You have taken the dreams of that nine year old boy  which were impossible and dauntingly scary  dauntingly terrifying  and put them into practice  and figured out a way to reprogram yourself  to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise. Just to finish  they asked me to play that guitar. I know this song  and it's really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself  but it's also  I think  a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe  we are people  and we're taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self perception into a new place.   This is Major Tom to ground control     I've left forevermore     And I'm floating in a most peculiar way     And the stars look very different today     For here am I floating in the tin can     A last glimpse of the world     Planet Earth is blue and  there's so much left to do   Fear not. That's very nice of you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I've come here today to talk to you about a problem. It's a very simple yet devastating problem  one that spans the globe and is affecting all of us. The problem is anonymous companies. It sounds like a really dry and technical thing  doesn't it  But anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes. So  why am I here talking to all of you  Well  I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and I to question authority  I don't think they knew where it might lead. And  they probably really regretted it during my stroppy teenage years when  predictably  I questioned their authority a lot. And a lot of my school teachers didn't appreciate it much either. You see  since the age of about five I've always asked the question  but why  But why does the Earth go around the sun  But why is blood red  But why do I have to go to school  But why do I have to respect the teachers and authority  And little did I realize that this question would become the basis of everything I would do. And so it was in my twenties  a long time ago  that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London I was sitting with Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley and we were busy stuffing envelopes for a mail out in the office of the campaign group where we worked at the time. And as usual  we were talking  about the world's problems. And in particular  we were talking about the civil war in Cambodia. And we had talked about that  many  many times before. But then suddenly we stopped and looked at each other and said  but why don't we try and change this  And from that slightly crazy question  over two decades and many campaigns later  including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war  from that crazy question  Global Witness is now an    strong team of campaigners  investigators   journalists and lawyers. And we're all driven by the same belief  that change really is possible. So  what exactly does Global Witness do  We investigate  we report  to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict    for stealing millions from citizens around the world  also known as state looting  and for destroying the environment. And then we campaign hard to  change the system itself. And we're doing this because  so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet. And much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices. And one of these is anonymous companies. Now we've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations  like in the Democratic Republic of Congo  where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars. That's twice the country's health  and education budget combined. Or in Liberia  where an international predatory logging company used front companies as it attempted to grab a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests. Or political corruption in Sarawak  Malaysia  which has led to the destruction  of much of its forests. Well  that uses anonymous companies too. We secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such companies. And the awful thing is  there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life. This truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight. Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel  the Zetas  who use anonymous companies  to launder profits while their drugs related violence is tearing communities apart across the Americas. Or the anonymous company  which bought up Americans' tax debts  piled on the legal fees and then gave homeowners a choice  Pay up or lose your home. Imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars  and not being able to find out who you were really up against. Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too. As the Iranian government found out when  through a series of front companies  it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan  on Fifth Avenue  despite American sanctions. And Juicy Couture  home of of the velvet track suit  and other companies were the unwitting  unknowing tenants there. There are just so many examples  the horesemeat scandal in Europe  the Italian mafia  they've used these companies for decades. The      million American Medicare fraud  the supply of weapons to wars around the world including those in Eastern Europe in the early '  s. Anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the Ukraine. But  for every case that we and others expose there are so many more that will remain hidden away because of the current system. And it's just a simple truth that some of the people responsible  for outrageous crimes  for stealing from you and me and millions of others  they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability and they're doing this with ease  and they're doing it using legal structures. And really  that is unfair. Well  you might well ask  what exactly is an anonymous company  and can I really set one up  and use it  without anyone knowing who I am  Well  the answer is  yes you can. But if you're anything like me  you'll want to see some of that for yourself  so let me show you. Well first you need to work out where you want to set it up. Now  at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here's the thing  shockingly  my own hometown  London  and indeed the U.K.  is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company. And the other  even better  I'm afraid that's America. Do you know  in some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card  like Delaware  which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company. Okay  so let's say it's America  and let's say it's Delaware  and now you can simply go online and find yourself a company service provider. These are the companies that  can set your one up for you  and remember  it's all legal  routine business practice. So  here's one  but there are plenty of others to choose from. And having made your choice  you then pick what type of company you want and then fill in a contact  name and address. But don't worry  it doesn't have to be your name. It can be your lawyer's or your service provider's  and it's not for the public record anyway. And then you add the owner of the company. Now this is the key part  and again it doesn't have to be you  because you can get creative  because there is a whole universe  out there of nominees to choose from. And nominees are the people that you can legally pay to be your company's owner. And if you don't want to involve anyone else  it doesn't even have to be an actual human being. It could be another company. And then finally  give your company a name add a few more details and make your payment. And then the service provider will take a few hours or more to process it. But there you are  in    minutes of online shopping you can create yourself an anonymous company. And not only is it easy  really  really easy and cheap  it's totally legal too. But the fun doesn't have to end there  maybe you want to be even more anonymous. Well  that's no problem either. You can simply keep adding layers  companies owned by companies. You can have hundreds of layers with hundreds of companies spread across lots of different countries  like a giant web  each layer adds anonymity. Each layer makes it more difficult for law enforcement and others to find out who the real owner is. But whose interests is this all serving  It might be in the interests of the company or a particular individual  but what about all of us  the public  There hasn't even been a global conversation yet about whether it's okay to misuse companies in this way. And what does it all mean for us  Well  an example that really haunts me is one I came across recently. And it's that of a horrific fire in a nightclub in Buenos Aires about a decade ago. It was the night before New Year's Eve. Three thousand very happy revelers  many of them teenagers  were crammed into a space meant for      . And then tragedy struck  a fire broke out plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling and toxic smoke filled the club. So people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut. Over     people died. Seven hundred were injured trying to get out. And as the victims' families  and the city and the country reeled in shock  investigators tried to find out who was responsible. And as they looked for the owners of the club  they found instead anonymous companies  and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies. Now ultimately  a range of people were charged and some went to jail. But this was an awful tragedy  and it shouldn't have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths. Because in an age when there is so much information out there in the open  why should this crucial information about company ownership stay hidden away  Why should tax evaders  corrupt  government officials  arms traders and more  be able to hide their identities from us  the public  Why should this secrecy be such  an accepted business practice  Anonymous companies might be the norm right now but it wasn't always this way. Companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line. Companies were created to limit financial risk  they were never intended to  be used as a moral shield. Companies were never intended to be anonymous  and they don't have to be. And so I come to my wish. My wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good. Together let's ignite world opinion  change the law  and launch a new era of openness in business. So what might this look like  Well  imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company. Imagine if this data were open and free  accessible across borders for citizens and businesses and law enforcement alike. Imagine what a game changer that would be. So how are we going to do this  Well  there is only one way. Together  we have to change the law globally to create public registries which list the true owners of companies and can be accessed by all with no loopholes. And yes  this is ambitious  but there is momentum on this issue  and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum  and it's just starting on this issue. There is such an opportunity right now. And the TED community of creative and innovative thinkers and doers across all of society could make the crucial difference. You really can make this change happen. Now  a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word. It's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning. And the techies among you  you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be. Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue. The U.K. government is already on board  it supports these public registries. And just last week  the European Parliament came on board with a vote     to    in favor of public registries. That is momentum. But it's early days. America still needs to come on board  as do so many other countries. And to succeed we will all together need to help and push our politicians  because without that  real far reaching  world shifting change just isn't going to happen. Because this isn't just about changing the law  this is about starting a conversation about what it's okay for companies to do  and in what ways is it acceptable  to use company structures. This isn't just a dry policy issue. This is a human issue which affects us all. This is about being on the right side of history. Global citizens  innovators   business leaders  individuals  we need you. Together  let's kickstart this global movement. Let's just do it  let's end anonymous companies. Thank you. Chris Anderson  We had Edward Snowden here a couple days ago  and this is response time. And several of you have written to me with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA. So Richard Ledgett is the   th deputy director of the National Security Agency  and he's a senior civilian officer there  acts as its chief operating officer  guiding strategies  setting internal policies  and serving as the principal advisor to the director. And all being well  welcome  Rick Ledgett  to TED. Richard Ledgett  I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here. I look forward to the conversation  so thanks for arranging for that. CA  Thank you  Rick. We appreciate you joining us. It's certainly quite a strong statement that the NSA is willing to reach out and show a more open face here. You saw  I think  the talk and interview that Edward Snowden gave here a couple days ago. What did you make of it  RL  So I think it was interesting. We didn't realize that he  was going to show up there  so kudos to you guys for arranging a nice surprise like that. I think that  like a lot of the things that have come out since Mr. Snowden started disclosing classified information  there were some kernels of truth in there  but a lot of extrapolations and half truths in there  and I'm interested in helping to address those. I think this is a really important conversation that we're having in the United States and internationally  and I think it is important and of import  and so given that  we need to have that be a fact based conversation  and we want to help make that happen. CA  So the question that a lot  of people have here is  what do you make of Snowden's motivations for doing what he did  and did he have an alternative way that he could have gone  RL  He absolutely did have alternative ways that he could have gone  and I actually think that characterizing him as a whistleblower actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities. So what if somebody who works in the NSA    and there are over        people who do. They're all great citizens. They're just like your husbands  fathers  sisters  brothers  neighbors  nephews  friends and relatives  all of whom are interested in doing the right thing for their country and for our allies internationally  and so there are a variety of venues to address if folks have a concern. First off  there's their supervisor  and up through the supervisory chain within their organization. If folks aren't comfortable with that  there are a number of inspectors general. In the case of Mr. Snowden  he had the option of the NSA inspector general  the Navy inspector general  the Pacific Command inspector general  the Department of Defense inspector general  and the intelligence community inspector general  any of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels and been happy to address them. He had the option to go to congressional committees  and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place  and so he didn't do any of those things. CA  Now  you had said that Ed Snowden had other avenues for raising his concerns. The comeback on that is a couple of things  one  that he certainly believes that as a contractor  the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available  two  there's a track record of other whistleblowers  like  Thomas Andrews Drake  being treated pretty harshly  by some views  and thirdly  what he was taking on was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered  but programs that had been approved by all three branches of government. I mean  in that circumstance  couldn't you argue that what he did was reasonable  RL  No  I don't agree with that. I think that the   sorry  I'm getting feedback through the microphone there   the actions that he took were inappropriate because of the fact that  he put people's lives at risk  basically  in the long run  and I know there's been a lot of talk in public by Mr. Snowden and some of the journalists that say that the things that have been disclosed have not put national security and people at risk  and that is categorically not true. They actually do. I think there's also an amazing arrogance to the idea that he knows better than the framers of the Constitution in how the government should  be designed and work for separation of powers and the fact that the executive  and the legislative branch have to work together and they have checks and balances on each other  and then the judicial branch  which oversees the entire process. I think that's extremely arrogant on his part. CA  Can you give a specific example of how he put people's lives at risk  RL  Yeah  sure. So the things that he's disclosed  the capabilities  and the NSA is a capabilities based organization  so when we have foreign intelligence targets  legitimate things of interest    like  terrorists is the iconic example  but it includes things like human traffickers  drug traffickers  people who are trying to build advanced weaponry  nuclear weapons  and build delivery systems for those  and nation states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors  which you may have some visibility into some of that that's going on right now  the capabilities are applied in very discrete and measured and controlled ways. So the unconstrained disclosure  of those capabilities means that as adversaries see them and recognize   Hey  I might be vulnerable to this   they move away from that  and we have seen targets in terrorism  in the nation state area  in smugglers of various types  and other folks who have  because of the disclosures  moved away from our ability to have insight into what they're doing. The net effect of that is that our people who are overseas in dangerous places  whether they're diplomats or military  and our allies who are in similar situations  are at greater risk because we don't see the threats that are coming their way. CA  So that's a general response saying that because of his revelations  access that you had to certain types of information has been shut down  has been closed down. But the concern is that the nature of that access was not necessarily legitimate in the first place. I mean  describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA specifically weakened security in order to get the type of  access that you've spoken of. RL  So there are  when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before  use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology  and they do  because it's a great system  it's the most complex system ever devised by man  and it is a wonder  and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that  and it's just a wonderful thing. But it's also used by people who are working against us and our allies. And so if I'm going to pursue them  I need to have the capability to go after them  and again  the controls are in how I apply that capability  not that I have the capability itself. Otherwise  if we could make it so that all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet  we could have a domain  badguy.com. That would be awesome  and we could just concentrate all our efforts there. That's not how it works. They're trying to hide from the government's ability to isolate and interdict their actions  and so we have to swim in that same space. But I will tell you this. So NSA has two missions. One is the Signals Intelligence mission that we've unfortunately read so much about in the press. The other one is the Information Assurance mission  which is to protect the national security systems of the United States  and by that  that's things like the communications that the president uses  the communications that control our nuclear weapons  the communications that our military uses around the world  and the communications that we use with our allies  and that some of our allies themselves use. And so we make recommendations on standards to use  and we use those same standards  and so we are invested in making sure that those communications are secure for their intended purposes. CA  But it sounds like what you're saying is that when it comes to the Internet at large  any strategy is fair game if it improves America's safety. And I think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion  that there's a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the Internet. They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity  kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press  for example. It's the bringer of knowledge to all. It's the connector of all. And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms. And from that lens  what the NSA has done is equivalent to the authorities back in Germany inserting some device into every printing press that would reveal which books people bought and what they read. Can you understand that from that viewpoint  it feels outrageous  RL  I do understand that  and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet  and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet. It is a global telecommunications system. The Internet is a big chunk of  that  but there is a lot more. And I think that people have legitimate concerns about the balance between transparency and secrecy. That's sort of been couched as a balance between privacy and national security. I don't think that's the right framing. I think it really is transparency and secrecy. And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having  and we want to participate in that  and want people to participate in it in an informed way. So there are things  let me talk there a little bit more  there are things that we need to be transparent about  our authorities  our processes  our oversight  who we are. We  NSA  have not done a good job of that  and I think that's part of the reason that this has been so revelational and so sensational in the media. Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency  the Never Say Anything. There's takeoffs of our logo of an eagle with headphones on around it. And so that's the public characterization. And so we need to be more transparent about those things. What we don't need to be transparent about  because it's bad for the U.S.  it's bad for all those other countries that we work with and that we help provide information that helps them secure themselves and their people  it's bad to expose operations and capabilities in a way that allows the people that we're all working against  the generally recognized bad guys  to counter those. CA  But isn't it also bad to deal a kind of body blow to the American companies that have essentially given the world most of the Internet services that matter  RL  It is. It's really the companies are in a tough position  as are we  because the companies  we compel them to provide information  just like every other nation in the world does. Every industrialized nation in the world has a lawful intercept program where they are requiring companies to provide them with information that they need for their security  and the companies that are involved have complied with those programs in the same way that they have to do when they're operating in Russia or the U.K. or China or India or France  any country that you choose to name. And so the fact that these revelations have been broadly characterized as  you can't trust company A because your privacy is suspect with them  is actually only accurate in the sense that it's accurate with every other company in the world that deals with any of those countries in the world. And so it's being picked up by people as a marketing advantage  and it's being marketed that  way by several countries  including some of our allied countries  where they are saying   Hey  you can't trust the U.S.  but you can trust our telecom company  because we're safe.  And they're actually using that to counter the very large technological edge that U.S. companies have in areas like the cloud and Internet based technologies. CA  You're sitting there with the American flag  and the American Constitution guarantees freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. How do you characterize the American citizen's right to privacy  Is there such a right  RL  Yeah  of course there is. And we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure  inordinate and appropriate  actually I should say  amount of time and effort in order to ensure that we protect that privacy. and beyond that  the privacy of citizens around the world  it's not just Americans. Several things come into play here. First  we're all in the same network. My communications  I'm a user of a particular Internet email service that is the number one email service of choice by terrorists around the world  number one. So I'm there right beside them in email space in the Internet. And so we need to be able to pick that apart and find the information that's relevant. In doing so  we're going to necessarily encounter Americans and innocent foreign citizens who are just going about their business  and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out  that says  when you find that  not if you find it  when you find it  because you're certain to find it  here's how you protect that. These are called minimization procedures. They're approved by the attorney general and constitutionally based. And so we protect those. And then  for people  citizens of the world who are going about their lawful business on a day to day basis  the president on his January    speech  laid out some additional protections that we are providing to them. So I think absolutely  folks do have a right to privacy  and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected. CA  What about foreigners using American companies' Internet services  Do they have any privacy rights  RL  They do. They do  in the sense of  the only way that we are able to compel one of those companies to provide us information is when it falls into one of three categories  We can identify that this particular person  identified by a selector of some kind  is associated with counterterrorist or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target. CA  Much has been made of the fact that a lot of the information that you've obtained through these programs is essentially metadata. It's not necessarily the actual words that someone has written in an email or given on a phone call. It's who they wrote to and when  and so forth. But it's been argued  and someone here in the audience has talked to a former NSA analyst who said metadata is actually much more invasive than the core data  because in the core data you present yourself as you want to be presented. With metadata  who knows what the conclusions are that are drawn  Is there anything to that  RL  I don't really understand that argument. I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons. Metadata is the information that lets you find connections that people are trying to hide. So when a terrorist is corresponding with somebody else who's not known to us but is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity  or someone who's violating international sanctions by providing nuclear weapons related material to a country like Iran or North Korea  is trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity. What metadata lets you do is connect that. The alternative to that is one that's much less efficient and much more invasive of privacy  which is gigantic amounts of content collection. So metadata  in that sense  actually is privacy enhancing. And we don't  contrary to some of the stuff that's been printed  we don't sit there and grind out metadata profiles of average people. If you're not connected to one of those valid intelligence targets  you are not of interest to us. CA  So in terms of the threats that face America overall  where would you place terrorism  RL  I think terrorism is still number one. I think that we have never been in a time where there are more places where things are going badly and forming the petri dish in which terrorists take advantage of the lack of governance. An old boss of mine  Tom Fargo  Admiral Fargo  used to describe it as arcs of instability. And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability in the world right now  in places like Syria  where there's a civil war going on and you have massive numbers  thousands and thousands of foreign fighters who are coming into Syria to learn how to be terrorists and practice that activity  and lots of those people are Westerners who hold passports to European countries or in some cases the United States  and so they are basically learning how to do jihad and have expressed intent to go out and do that later on in their home countries. You've got places like Iraq  which is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence  again a breeding ground for terrorism. And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel area of Africa. Again  lots of weak governance which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity. So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one. I think number two is cyber threat. I think cyber is a threat in three ways  One way  and probably the most common way that people have heard about it  is due to the theft of intellectual property  so basically  foreign countries going in  stealing companies' secrets  and then providing that information to state owned enterprises or companies connected to the government to help them leapfrog technology or to gain business intelligence that's then used to win contracts overseas. That is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now. Several nation states are doing it. Second is the denial of service attacks. You're probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the U.S. financial sector since     . Again  that's a nation state who is executing those attacks  and they're doing that as a semi anonymous way of reprisal. And the last one is destructive attacks  and those are the ones that concern me the most. Those are on the rise. You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in       August of     . It took down about        of their computers with a Wiper style virus. You had a follow on a week later to a Qatari company. You had March of       you had a South Korean attack that was attributed in the press to North Korea that took out thousands of computers. Those are on the rise  and we see people expressing interest in those capabilities and a desire to employ them. CA  Okay  so a couple of things here  because this is really the core of this  almost. I mean  first of all  a lot of people who look at risk and look at the numbers don't understand this belief that terrorism is still the number one threat. Apart from September     I think the numbers are that in the last    or    years about     Americans have died from terrorism  mostly from homegrown terrorists. The chance in the last few years of being killed by terrorism is far less than the chance of being killed by lightning. I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers. Would that be the point of view  RL  Well  I'd say two things. One is  the reason that there hasn't been a major attack in the United States since       that is not an accident. That's a lot of hard work that we have done  that other folks in the intelligence community have done  that the military has done  and that our allies around the globe have done. You've heard the numbers about the tip of the iceberg in terms of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs contributed to stopping was        of those in Europe  and of those        of them occurred in three countries  some of which are our allies  and some of which are beating the heck out of us over the NSA programs  by the way. So that's not an accident that those things happen. That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence on terrorist activities and interdicting them through one way or another  through law enforcement  through cooperative activities with other countries and sometimes through military action. The other thing I would say is that your idea of nuclear or chem bio threat is not at all far fetched and in fact there are a number of groups who have for several years expressed interest and desire in obtaining those capabilities and work towards that. CA  It's also been said that  of those    alleged incidents  that as few as zero of them were actually anything to do with these controversial programs that Mr. Snowden revealed  that it was basically through other forms of intelligence  that you're looking for a needle in a haystack  and the effects of these programs  these controversial programs  is just to add hay to the stack  not to really find the needle. The needle was found by other methods. Isn't there something to that  RL  No  there's actually two programs that are typically implicated in that discussion. One is the section     program  the U.S. telephony metadata program  and the other one is popularly called the PRISM program  and it's actually section      of the FISA Amendment Act. But the     program is only relevant to threats that are directed against the United States  and there have been a dozen threats where that was implicated. Now what you'll see people say publicly is there is no  but for  case  and so there is no case where  but for that  the threat would have happened. But that actually indicates a lack of understanding of how terrorist investigations actually work. You think about on television  you watch a murder mystery. What do you start with  You start with a body  and then they work their way from there to solve the crime. We're actually starting well before that  hopefully before there are any bodies  and we're trying to build the case for who the people are  what they're trying to do  and that involves massive amounts of information. Think of it is as mosaic  and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic was necessary to building the mosaic  but to build the complete picture  you need to have all the pieces of information. On the other  the non U.S. related threats out of those     the other    of them  the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that  and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks. CA  Snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world  a cover for action   that it's something that  because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people  it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn't otherwise have. Is there any internal debate about that  RL  Yeah. I mean  we debate these things all the time  and there is discussion that goes on in the executive branch and within NSA itself and the intelligence community about what's right  what's proportionate  what's the correct thing to do. And it's important to note that the programs that we're talking about were all authorized by two different presidents  two different political parties  by Congress twice  and by federal judges    different times  and so this is not NSA running off and doing its own thing. This is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government  and President Madison would have been proud. CA  And yet  when congressmen discovered what was actually being done  with that authorization  many of them were completely shocked. Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction  that it's only because it's now come out publicly  that they really knew exactly what you were doing with the powers they had granted you  RL  Congress is a big body. There's     of them  and they change out frequently  in the case of the House  every two years  and I think that the NSA provided all the relevant information to our oversight committees  and then the dissemination of that information by the oversight committees throughout Congress is something that they manage. I think I would say that Congress members had the opportunity to make themselves aware  and in fact a significant number of them  the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility  did have the ability to do that. And you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public. CA  Now  you mentioned the  threat of cyberattacks  and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree that that is a huge concern  but do you accept that there's a tradeoff between offensive and defensive strategies  and that it's possible that the very measures taken to   weaken encryption   and allow yourself to find the bad guys  might also open the door to forms of cyberattack  RL  So I think two things. One is  you said weaken encryption. I didn't. And the other one is that the NSA has both of those missions  and we are heavily biased towards defense  and  actually  the vulnerabilities that we find in the overwhelming majority of cases  we disclose to the people who are responsible for manufacturing or developing those products. We have a great track record of that  and we're actually working on a proposal right now to be transparent and to publish transparency reports in the same way that the Internet companies are being allowed to publish transparency reports for them. We want to be more transparent about that. So again  we eat our own dog food. We use the standards  we use the products that we recommend  and so it's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people's need to be. CA  Edward Snowden  when  after his talk  was wandering the halls here in the bot  and I heard him say to a couple of people  they asked him about what he thought of the NSA overall  and he was very complimentary about the people who work with you  said that it's a really impassioned group of employees who are seeking to do the right thing  and that the problems have come from just some badly conceived policies. He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly. He didn't come over like a crazy man. Would you accept that at least  even if you disagree with how he did it  that he has opened a debate that matters  RL  So I think that the discussion is an important one to have. I do not like the way that he did it. I think there were a number of other ways that he could have done that that would have not endangered our people and the people of other nations through losing visibility into what our adversaries are doing. But I do think it's an important conversation. CA  It's been reported that there's almost a difference of opinion with you and your colleagues over any scenario in which he might be offered an amnesty deal. I think your boss  General Keith Alexander  has said that that would be a terrible example for others  you can't negotiate with someone who's broken the law in that way. But you've been quoted as saying that  if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering all undisclosed documents  that a deal maybe should be considered. Do you still think that  RL  Yeah  so actually  this is my favorite thing about that     Minutes  interview was all the misquotes that came from that. What I actually said  in  response to a question about  would you entertain any discussions of mitigating action against Snowden  I said  yeah  it's worth a conversation. This is something that the attorney general of the United States and the president also actually have both talked about this  and I defer to the attorney general  because this is his lane. But there is a strong tradition in American jurisprudence of having discussions with people who have been charged with crimes in order to  if it benefits the government  to get something out of that  that there's always room for that kind of discussion. So I'm not presupposing any outcome  but there is always room for discussion. CA  To a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the U.S.  the government  you  others  in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy  a smarter way forward for the future. Do you see  has that kind of possibility been entertained at all  RL  So that's out of my lane. That's not an NSA thing. That would be a Department of Justice sort of discussion. I'll defer to them. CA  Rick  when Ed Snowden ended his talk  I offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading. What would be your idea worth spreading for this group  RL  So I think  learn the facts. This is a really important conversation  and it impacts  it's not just NSA  it's not just the government  it's you  it's the Internet companies. The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government  and so learn the facts. Don't rely on headlines  don't rely on sound bites  don't rely on one sided conversations. So that's the idea  I think  worth spreading. We have a sign  a badge tab  we wear badges at work with lanyards  and if I could make a plug  my badge lanyard at work says   Dallas Cowboys.  Go Dallas. I've just alienated half the audience  I know. So the lanyard that our people who work in the organization that does our crypto analytic work have a tab that says   Look at the data.  So that's the idea worth spreading. Look at the data. CA  Rick  it took a certain amount of courage  I think  actually  to come and speak openly to this group. It's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past  and plus the technology has been challenging. We truly appreciate you doing that and sharing in this very important conversation. Thank you so much. RL  Thanks  Chris. Charlie Rose  So Larry sent me an email and he basically said  we've got to make sure that  we don't seem like we're a couple of middle aged boring men. I said  I'm flattered by that    because I'm a bit older  and he has a bit more net worth than I do. Larry Page  Well  thank you. CR  So we'll have a conversation about the Internet  and we'll have a conversation Google  and we'll have a conversation about search and privacy  and also about your philosophy and a sense of how you've connected the dots and how this journey that began some time ago has such interesting prospects. Mainly we want to talk about the future. So my first question  Where is Google and where is it going  LP  Well  this is something we think about a lot  and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And people always say  is that really what you guys are still doing  And I always kind of think about that myself  and I'm not quite sure. But actually  when I think about search  it's such a deep thing for all of us  to really understand what you want  to understand the world's information  and we're still very much in the early stages of that  which is totally crazy. We've been at it for    years already  but it's not at all done. CR  When it's done  how will it be  LP  Well  I guess  in thinking about where we're going    you know  why is it not done     a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess. You know  your computer doesn't know where you are  it doesn't know what you're doing  it doesn't know what you know  and a lot we've been trying to do recently is just make your devices work  make them understand your context. Google Now  you know  knows where you are  knows what you may need. So really having computing  work and understand you and understand that information  we really haven't done that yet. It's still very  very clunky. CR  Tell me  when you look at what Google is doing  where does Deep Mind fit  LP  Yeah  so Deep Mind is a company we just acquired recently. It's in the U.K. First  let me tell you the way we got there  which was looking at search and really understanding  trying to understand everything  and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you    like  voice was really important. So what's the state of the art  on speech recognition  It's not very good. It doesn't really understand you. So we started doing machine learning research to improve that. That helped a lot. And we started just looking at things like YouTube. Can we understand YouTube  But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats  just by itself. Now  that's an important concept. And we realized there's really something here. If we can learn what cats are  that must be really important. So I think Deep Mind  what's really amazing about Deep Mind is that it can actually    they're learning things in this unsupervised way. They started with video games  and really just  maybe I can show the video  just playing video games  and learning how to do that automatically. CR  Take a look at the video games and how machines are coming to be able to do some remarkable things. LP  The amazing thing about this is this is  I mean  obviously  these are old games  but the system just sees what you see  the pixels  and it has the controls and it has the score  and it's learned to play all of these games  same program. It's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance. We've not been able to do things like this with computers before. And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly. This is boxing  and it figures out it can sort of pin the opponent down. The computer's on the left  and it's just racking up points. So imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule  or your information needs  or things like that. We're really just at the beginning of that  and that's what I'm really excited about. CR  When you look at all that's taken place with Deep Mind and the boxing  also a part of where we're going is artificial intelligence. Where are we  when you look at that  LP  Well  I think for me  this is kind of one of the most exciting things I've seen in a long time. The guy who started this company  Demis  has a neuroscience and a computer science background. He went back to school to get his Ph.D. to study the brain. And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things. CR  But where's the level of it now  And how fast do you think we are moving  LP  Well  this is the state of the art right now  understanding cats on YouTube and things like that  improving voice recognition. We used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally  but I think for me  this example's really exciting  because it's one program that can do a lot of different things. CR  I don't know if we can do this  but we've got the image of the cat. It would be wonderful to see this. This is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with. Can we see that image  LP  Yeah. CR  There it is. Can you see the cat  Designed by machines  seen by machines. LP  That's right. So this is learned from just watching YouTube. And there's no training  no notion of a cat  but this concept of a cat is something important that you would understand  and now that the machines can kind of understand. Maybe just finishing also on the search part  it started with search  really understanding people's context and their information. I did have a video I wanted to show quickly on that that we actually found. Zack Matere  Not long ago  I planted a crop of potatoes. Then suddenly they started dying one after the other. I checked out the books and  they didn't tell me much. So  I went and I did a search.   Zack Matere  Farmer   Potato diseases. One of the websites told me that ants could be the problem. It said  sprinkle wood ash over the plants. Then after a few days the ants disappeared. I got excited about the Internet. I have this friend who really would like to expand his business. So I went with him to the cyber cafe and we checked out several sites. When I met him next  he was going to put a windmill at the local school. I felt proud because something that wasn't there before was suddenly there. I realized that not everybody can be able to access what I was able to access. I thought that I need to have an Internet that my grandmother can use. So I thought about a notice board. A simple wooden notice board. When I get information on my phone  I'm able to post the information on the notice board. So it's basically like a computer. I use the Internet to help people. I think I am searching for a better life for me and my neighbors. So many people have access to information  but there's no follow up to that. I think the follow up to that is our knowledge. When people have the knowledge  they can find solutions without having to helped out. Information is powerful  but it is how we use it that will define us. LP  Now  the amazing thing about that video  actually  was we just read about it in the news  and we found this gentlemen  and made that little clip. CR  When I talk to people about you  they say to me  people who know you well  say  Larry wants to change the world  and he believes technology can show the way. And that means access to the Internet. It has to do with languages. It also means how people can get access and do things that will affect their community  and this is an example. LP  Yeah  that's right  and I think for me  I have been focusing on access more  if we're talking about the future. We recently released this Loon Project which is using balloons to do it. It sounds totally crazy. We can show the video here. Actually  two out of three people in the world don't have good Internet access now. We actually think this can really help people sort of cost efficiently. CR  It's a balloon. LP  Yeah  get access to the Internet. CR  And why does this balloon give you access to the Internet  Because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible  they didn't have to be tethered. LP  Yeah  and this is a good example of innovation. Like  we've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it  but it was just really  how do we get access points up high  cheaply  You normally have to use satellites and it takes a long time to launch them. But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up  and actually again  it's the power of the Internet  I did a search on it  and I found         years ago  someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the Earth multiple times. And I thought  why can't we do that today  And that's how this project got going. CR  But are you at the mercy of the wind  LP  Yeah  but it turns out  we did some weather simulations which probably hadn't really been done before  and if you control the altitude of the balloons  which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways  you can actually control roughly where they go  and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet. CR  Before I talk about the future and transportation  where you've been a nerd for a while  and this fascination you have with transportation and automated cars and bicycles  let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here earlier with Edward Snowden. It is security and privacy. You have to have been thinking about that. LP  Yeah  absolutely. I saw the picture of Sergey with Edward Snowden yesterday. Some of you may have seen it. But I think  for me  I guess  privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things  and I think you can't have privacy without security  so let me just talk about security first  because you asked about Snowden and all of that  and then I'll say a little bit about privacy. I think for me  it's tremendously disappointing that the government secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us. I don't think we can have a democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government for stuff that we've never had a conversation about. And I don't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried about protecting us from  but we do need to know what the parameters of it is  what kind of surveillance the government's going to do and how and why  and I think we haven't had that conversation. So I think the government's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret. CR  Never coming to Google to ask for anything. LP  Not Google  but the public. I think we need to  have a debate about that  or we can't have a functioning democracy. It's just not possible. So I'm sad that Google's in the position of protecting you and our users from the government doing secret thing that nobody knows about. It doesn't make any sense. CR  Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it. LP  Yes. The privacy side  I think it's    the world is changing. You carry a phone. It knows where you are. There's so much more information about you  and that's an important thing  and it makes sense why people are asking difficult questions. We spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are. I'm a little bit    I think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice  show them what data's being collected    search history  location data. We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome  and doing that in more ways  just giving people more choice and more awareness of what's going on. I also think it's very easy. What I'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater. And I look at  on your show  actually  I kind of lost my voice  and I haven't gotten it back. I'm hoping that by talking to you I'm going to get it back. CR  If I could do anything  I would do that. LP  All right. So get out your voodoo doll and whatever you need to do. But I think  you know what  I look at that  I made that public  and I got all this information. We got a survey done on medical conditions with people who have similar issues  and I look at medical records  and I say  wouldn't it be amazing if everyone's medical records were available anonymously to research doctors  And when someone accesses your medical record  a research doctor  they could see  you could see which doctor accessed it and why  and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have. I think if we just did that  we'd save         lives this year. CR  Absolutely. Let me go    Applause  LP  So I guess I'm just very worried that with Internet privacy  we're doing the same thing we're  doing with medical records  is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater  and we're not really thinking about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways. CR  And the necessary condition that people have to have confidence that their information will not be abused. LP  Yeah  and I had this problem with my voice stuff. I was scared to share it. Sergey encouraged me to do that  and it was a great thing to do. CR  And the response has been overwhelming. LP  Yeah  and people are super positive. We got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions  which there's no data on today. So it was a really good thing. CR  So talking about the future  what is it about you and transportation systems  LP  Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated with this when I was at college in Michigan. I had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it. And it was cold and snowing. I did some research on how much it cost  and I just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems. CR  And that began the idea of an automated car. LP  Yeah  about    years ago I learned about people working on automated cars  and I became fascinated by that  and it takes a while to  get these projects going  but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world. There's    million people or more injured per year. It's the leading cause of death for people under    in the U.S. CR  So you're talking about saving lives. LP  Yeah  and also saving space and making life better. Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads  half of the area  and most cities are not far behind  actually. It's just crazy that that's what we use our space for. CR  And how soon will we be there  LP  I think we can be there very  very soon. We've driven well over         miles now totally automated. I'm super excited about getting that out quickly. CR  But it's not only you're talking about automated cars. You also have this idea for bicycles. LP  Well at Google  we got this idea that we should just provide free bikes to everyone  and that's been amazing  most of the trips. You see bikes going everywhere  and the bikes wear out. They're getting used    hours a day. CR  But you want to put them above the street  too. LP  Well I said  how do we get people using bikes more  CR  We may have a video here. LP  Yeah  let's show the video. I just got excited about this. So this is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost. Anyway  it looks totally crazy  but I was actually thinking about our campus  working with the Zippies and stuff  and just trying to get a lot more bike usage  and I was thinking about  how do you cost effectively separate the bikes from traffic  And I went and searched  and this is what I found. And we're not actually working on this  that particular thing  but it gets your imagination going. CR  Let me close with this. Give me a sense of the philosophy  of your own mind. You have this idea of  Google X . You don't simply want to go in some small  measurable arena of progress. LP  Yeah  I think many of the things we just  talked about are like that  where they're really    I almost use the economic concept of additionality  which means that you're doing something that wouldn't happen unless  you were actually doing it. And I think the more you can do things like that  the bigger impact you have  and that's about doing things that people might not think are possible. And I've been amazed  the more I learn about technology  the more I realize I don't know  and that's because this technological horizon  the thing that you can see to do next  the more you learn about technology  the more you learn what's possible. You learn that the balloons are possible because there's some material that will work for them. CR  What's interesting about  you too  though  for me  is that  we have lots of people who are thinking about the future  and they are going and looking and they're coming back  but we never see the implementation. I think of somebody you knew and read about  Tesla. The principle of that for you is what  LP  Well  I think invention is not enough. If you invent something  Tesla invented electric power that we use  but he struggled to get it out to people. That had to be done by other people. It took a long time. And I think if we can actually combine both things  where we have an innovation and invention focus  plus the ability to really    a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that's positive for the world and to give people hope. You know  I'm amazed with the Loon Project just how excited people were about that  because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good. CR  Which is a second thing about corporations. You are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well. LP  Yeah. I'm really dismayed most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct. Companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did    years ago or    years ago. That's not really what we need. We need  especially in technology  we need revolutionary change  not incremental change. CR  You once said  actually  as I think I've got this about right  that you might consider  rather than giving your money  if you were leaving it to some cause  just simply giving it to Elon Musk  because you had confidence that he would change the future  and that you would therefore   LP  Yeah  if you want to go Mars  he wants to go to Mars  to back up humanity  that's a worthy goal  but it's a company  and it's philanthropical. So I think we aim to do kind of similar things. And I think  you ask  we have a lot of employees at Google who have become pretty wealthy. People make a lot of money in technology. A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world. You want to make it better. Why isn't the company that you work for worthy not just of your time but your money as well  I mean  but we don't have a concept of that. That's not how we think about companies  and I think it's sad  because companies are most of our effort. They're where most of people's time is  where a lot of the money is  and so I think I'd like for us to help out more than we are. CR  When I close conversations with lots of people  I always ask this question  What state of mind  what quality of mind is it that has served you best  People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity  and other people in the media have said that. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus. What quality of mind  as I leave this audience  has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present  LP  You know  I think the most important thing    I looked at lots of companies and why I thought they don't succeed over time. We've had a more rapid turnover of companies. And I said  what did they fundamentally do wrong  What did those companies all do wrong  And usually it's just that they missed the future. And so I think  for me  I just try to focus on that and say  what is that future really going to be and how do we create it  and how do we cause our organization  to really focus on that and drive that at a really high rate  And so that's been curiosity  it's been looking at things people might not think about  working on things that no one else is working on  because that's where the additionality really is  and be willing to do that  to take that risk. Look at Android. I felt guilty about working on Android when it was starting. It was a little startup we bought. It wasn't really what we were really working on. And I felt guilty about spending time on that. That was stupid. That was the future  right  That was a good thing to be working on. CR  It is great to see you here. It's great to hear from you  and a pleasure to sit at this table with you. Thanks  Larry. LP  Thank you. CR  Larry Page. In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies  fathers are usually known by their sons  but I'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter  and I am proud of it. Malala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in       and when her efforts were honored in       and she was given the national youth peace prize  and she became a very famous  very popular young girl of her country. Before that  she was my daughter  but now I am her father. Ladies and gentlemen  if we glance to human history  the story of women is the story of injustice  inequality  violence and exploitation. You see  in patriarchal societies  right from the very beginning  when a girl is born  her birth is not celebrated. She is not welcomed  neither by father nor by mother. The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother  and nobody congratulates the father. And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child. When she gives birth to the first girl child  first daughter  she is sad. When she gives birth to the second daughter  she is shocked  and in the expectation of a son  when she gives birth to a third daughter  she feels guilty like a criminal. Not only the mother suffers  but the daughter  the newly born daughter  when she grows old  she suffers too. At the age of five  while she should be going to school  she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school. Until the age of     somehow  she has a good life. She can have fun. She can play with her friends in the streets  and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly. But when she enters her teens  when she becomes    years old  she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort. She is confined under the four walls of her home. She is no more a free individual. She becomes the so called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family  and if she transgresses the code of that so called honor  she could even be killed. And it is also interesting that this so called code of honor  it does not only affect the life of a girl  it also affects the life of the male members of the family. I know a family of seven sisters and one brother  and that one brother  he has migrated to the Gulf countries  to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents  because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood. So this brother  he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so called honor. And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience. A good girl is supposed to be very quiet  very humble and very submissive. It is the criteria. The role model good girl should be very quiet. She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders  even if she does not like them. If she is married to a man she doesn't like or if she is married to an old man  she has to accept  because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient. If she is married very early  she has to accept. Otherwise  she will be called disobedient. And what happens at the end  In the words of a poetess  she is wedded  bedded  and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters. And it is the irony of the situation that this mother  she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons. And this vicious cycle goes on  goes on. Ladies and gentlemen  this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently  if women and men think differently  if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries  if they can break a few norms of family and society  if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states  which go against the basic human rights of the women. Dear brothers and sisters  when Malala was born  and for the first time  believe me  I don't like newborn children  to be honest  but when I went and I looked into her eyes  believe me  I got extremely honored. And long before she was born  I thought about her name  and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan. Her name was Malalai of Maiwand  and I named my daughter after her. A few days after Malala was born  my daughter was born  my cousin came    and it was a coincidence    he came to my home and he brought a family tree  a family tree of the Yousafzai family  and when I looked at the family tree  it traced back to     years of our ancestors. But when I looked  all were men  and I picked my pen  drew a line from my name  and wrote   Malala.  And when she grow old  when she was four and a half years old  I admitted her in my school. You will be asking  then  why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school  Yes  I must mention it. It may be taken for granted in Canada  in America  in many developed countries  but in poor countries  in patriarchal societies  in tribal societies  it's a big event for the life of girl. Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name. Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life. I have five sisters  and none of them could go to school  and you will be astonished  two weeks before  when I was filling out the Canadian visa form  and I was filling out the family part of the form  I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters. And the reason was that I have never  never seen the names of my sisters written on any document. That was the reason that I valued my daughter. What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters  I thought I must change it. I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter. I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come. I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings. And all these good values  I tried to inculcate in her personality. And this was not only she  only Malala. I imparted all these good values to my school  girl students  and boy students as well. I used education for emancipation. I taught my girls  I taught my girl students  to unlearn the lesson of obedience. I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so called pseudo honor. Dear brothers and sisters  we were striving for more rights for women  and we were struggling to have more  more and more space for the women in society. But we came across a new phenomenon. It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights. It was called Talibanization. It means a complete negation of women's participation in all political  economical and social activities. Hundreds of schools were lost. Girls were prohibited from going to school. Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets. Musicians were silenced  girls were flogged and singers were killed. Millions were suffering  but few spoke  and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog  and you speak for your rights. It's really the most scary thing. At the age of     Malala stood  and she stood for the right of education. She wrote a diary for the BBC blog  she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries  and she spoke from every platform she could. And her voice was the most powerful voice. It spread like a crescendo all around the world. And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign  and on October         she was shot in the head at point blank range. It was a doomsday for my family and for me. The world turned into a big black hole. While my daughter was on the verge of life and death  I whispered into the ears of my wife   Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter   And she abruptly told me   Please don't blame yourself. You stood for the right cause. You put your life at stake for the cause of truth  for the cause of peace  and for the cause of education  and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you. You both were on the right path and God will protect her.  These few words meant a lot to me  and I didn't ask this question again. When Malala was in the hospital  and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down  I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife. But my daughter never complained. She used to tell us   I'm fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face. I'll be okay. Please don't worry.  She was a solace for us  and she consoled us. Dear brothers and sisters  we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times  and I'm glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women  she is like any    year old girl. She cries when her homework is incomplete. She quarrels with her brothers  and I am very happy for that. People ask me  what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised  I tell them  don't ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings  and that's all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Good morning. When I was a little boy  I had an experience that changed my life  and is in fact why I'm here today. That one moment profoundly affected how I think about art  design and engineering. As background  I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world's great cities. My dad  John Ferren  who died when I was     was an artist by both passion and profession  as is my mom  Rae. He was one of the New York School abstract expressionists who  together with his contemporaries  invented American modern art  and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist towards modernism in the   th century. Isn't it remarkable that  after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art  that modern art  comparatively speaking  is about    minutes old  yet now pervasive. As with many other important innovations  those radical ideas required no new technology  just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment  plus resiliency in the face of near universal criticism and rejection. In our home  art was everywhere. It was like oxygen  around us and necessary for life. As I watched him paint  Dad taught me that art was not about being decorative  but was a different way of communicating ideas  and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight. Given this rich artistic environment  you'd assume that I would have been compelled to go into the family business  but no. I followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy. I had no interest in becoming an artist  certainly not a painter. What I did love was electronics and machines    taking them apart  building new ones  and making them work. Fortunately  my family also had engineers in it  and with my parents  these were my first role models. What they all had in common was they worked very  very hard. My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn. On weekends  we would go together to Cortlandt Street  which was New York City's radio row. There we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics  and for a few bucks bring home treasures like Norden bombsights and parts from the first IBM tube based computers. I found these objects both useful and fascinating. I learned about engineering and how things worked  not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices. I did this for hours every day  apparently avoiding electrocution. Life was good. However  every summer  sadly  the machines got left behind while my parents and I traveled overseas to experience history  art and design. We visited the great museums and historic buildings of both Europe and the Middle East  but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology  they would simply drop me off in places like the London Science Museum  where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself studying the history of science and technology. Then  when I was about nine years old  we went to Rome. On one particularly hot summer day  we visited a drum shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting. My dad said it was called the Pantheon  a temple for all of the gods. It didn't look all that special from the outside  as I said  but when we walked inside  I was immediately struck by three things  First of all  it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside. It was very dark  the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof. Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole  but it was called the oculus  an eye to the heavens. And there was something about this place  I didn't know why  that just felt special. As we walked to the center of the room  I looked up at the heavens through the oculus. This was the first church that I'd been to that provided an unrestricted view between God and man. But I wondered  what about when it rained  Dad may have called this an oculus  but it was  in fact  a big hole in the roof. I looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor. As I became more accustomed to the dark  I was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls. No big deal here  just the same statuary stuff that we'd seen all over Rome. In fact  it looked like the Appian Way marble salesman showed up with his sample book  showed it to Hadrian  and Hadrian said   We'll take all of it.  But the ceiling was amazing. It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome. I'd seen these before  and Bucky was friends with my dad. It was modern  high tech  impressive  a huge     foot clear span which  not coincidentally  was exactly its height. I loved this place. It was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before  so I asked my dad   When was this built   He said   About       years ago.  And I said   No  I mean  the roof.  You see  I assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long past war. He said   It's the original roof.  That moment changed my life  and I can remember it as if it were yesterday. For the first time  I realized people were smart       years ago.  Laughter  This had never crossed my mind. I mean  to me  the pyramids at Giza  we visited those the year before  and sure they're impressive  nice enough design  but look  give me an unlimited budget         to        laborers  and about    to    years to cut and drag stone blocks  across the countryside  and I'll build you pyramids too. But no amount of brute force gets you the dome of the Pantheon  not       years ago  nor today. And incidentally  it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built. To build the Pantheon took some miracles. By miracles  I mean things that are technically barely possible  very high risk  and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time  certainly not by you. For example  here are some of the Pantheon's miracles. To make it even structurally possible  they had to invent super strong concrete  and to control weight  varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome. For strength and lightness  the dome structure used five rings of coffers  each of diminishing size  which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design. It was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass  natural convection of air rising up through the oculus  and a Venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building. I discovered for the first time that light itself has substance. The shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable  and I realized for the first time that light could be designed. Further  that of all of the forms of design  visual design  they were all kind of irrelevant without it  because without light  you can't see any of them. I also realized that I wasn't the first person to think that this place was really special. It survived gravity  barbarians  looters  developers and the ravages of time to become what I believe is the longest continuously occupied building in history. Largely because of that visit  I came to understand that  contrary to what I was being told in school  the worlds of art and design were not  in fact  incompatible with science and engineering. I realized  when combined  you could create things that were amazing that couldn't be done in either domain alone. But in school  with few exceptions  they were treated as separate worlds  and they still are. My teachers told me that I had to get serious and focus on one or the other. However  urging me to specialize only caused me to really  appreciate those polymaths like Michelangelo  Leonardo da Vinci  Benjamin Franklin  people who did exactly the opposite. And this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds. So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the Pantheon actually happen  Someone themselves  perhaps Hadrian  needed a brilliant creative vision. They also needed the storytelling and leadership skills necessary to fund and execute it  and a mastery of science and technology with the ability and knowhow to push existing innovations even farther. It is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles. The problem is  no matter how talented  rich or smart you are  you only get one to one and a half miracles. That's it. That's the quota. Then you run out of time  money  enthusiasm  whatever. Remember  most people can't even imagine one of these technical miracles  and you need at least five to make a Pantheon. In my experience  these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of art  design and engineering have the ability to notice when others have provided enough of the miracles to bring the goal within reach. Driven by the clarity of their vision  they summon the courage and determination to deliver the remaining miracles and they often take what other people think to be insurmountable obstacles and turn them into features. Take the oculus of the Pantheon. By insisting that it be in the design  it meant you couldn't use much of the structural technology that had been developed for Roman arches. However  by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution  they came up with a design that only works if there's a big hole in the roof. That done  you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of light  cooling and that critical direct connection with the heavens. Not bad. These people not only believed that the impossible can be done  but that it must be done. Enough ancient history. What are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now  Well  putting a man on the moon was a good one  and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either. Talk about one giant leap  It's hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when we first left our world to set foot on another. So what came after the moon  One is tempted to say that today's pantheon is the Internet  but I actually think that's quite wrong  or at least it's only part of the story. The Internet isn't a Pantheon. It's more like the invention of concrete  important  absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon  and enduring  but entirely insufficient by itself. However  just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the Pantheon  new designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure. The smartphone is a perfect example. Soon the majority of people on the planet will have one  and the idea of connecting everyone to both knowledge and each other will endure. So what's next  What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon  Thinking about this  I rejected many very plausible and dramatic breakthroughs to come  such as curing cancer. Why  Because Pantheons are anchored in designed physical objects  ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them  and will continue to do so indefinitely. It is a different kind of language  like art. These other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are  of course  critical  and fantastic  but they're part of the continuum of our overall knowledge and technology  like the Internet. So what is next  Perhaps counterintuitively  I'm guessing it's a visionary idea from the late     s that's been revived every decade since  autonomous vehicles. Now you're thinking  give me a break. How can a fancy version of cruise control be profound  Look  much of our world has been designed around  roads and transportation. These were as essential to the success of the Roman Empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the United States. Today  these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for     years. Although perhaps not obvious today  autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and  by extension  civilization. Here's why  Once they become ubiquitous  each year  these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone and a million globally. Automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically. Much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear. They will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities  work  and the way we live. We will get where we're going faster and society will recapture vast amounts of lost productivity now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting. But why now  Why do we think this is ready  Because over the last    years  people from outside the automotive industry have spent countless billions creating the needed miracles  but for entirely different purposes. It took folks like DARPA  universities  and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it  autonomy could be done now. So what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles  One  you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is. This was solved neatly by the GPS system  Global Positioning System  that the U.S. Government put in place. You need to know where all the roads are  what the rules are  and where you're going. The various needs of personal navigation systems  in car navigation systems  and web based maps address this. You must have near continuous communication with high performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent. The wireless technologies developed for mobile devices  with some minor modifications  are completely suitable to solve this. You'll probably want some restricted roadways to get started that both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this. This will start with the HOV lanes and move from there. But finally  you need to recognize people  signs and objects. Machine vision  special sensors  and high performance computing can do a lot of this  but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board. Occasionally  humans will  need to do sense making. For this  you might actually have to wake up your passenger and ask them what the hell that big lump is in the middle of the road. Not so bad  and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world. Besides  once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant  and it's okay to keep driving  every other car on the surface of the Earth will know that from that point on. Five miracles  mostly delivered  and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful  and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home. The beginning is now only a handful of years away  and I predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades. In conclusion  I've come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us  just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge  multidisciplinary skills  and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality. But these people don't spontaneously pop into existence. They need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they're little kids. We need to love them and help them discover their passions. We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success  as is perseverance. We need to help them to find their own role models  and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible  and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus  and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums  we need to encourage them to find their own path  even if it's very different from our own. But a cautionary note  We also need to periodically pry them away from their modern miracles  the computers  phones  tablets  game machines and TVs  take them out into the sunlight so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world  our planet and our civilization. If we don't  they won't understand what these precious things are that someday they will be resopnsible for protecting and improving. We also need them to understand something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly tech dependent world  that art and design are not luxuries  nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering. They are in fact essential to what makes us special. Someday  if you get the chance  perhaps you can take your kids to the actual Pantheon  as we will our daughter Kira  to experience firsthand the power of that astonishing design  which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome  reached       years into the future to set the course for my life. Thank you. A herd of wildebeests  a shoal of fish  a flock of birds. Many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world. But why do these groups form  The common answers include things like seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs or gathering to mate or breed  and all of these explanations  while often true  make a huge assumption about animal behavior  that the animals are in control of their own actions  that they are in charge of their bodies. And that is often not the case. This is Artemia  a brine shrimp. You probably know it better as a sea monkey. It's small  and it typically lives alone  but it can gather in these large red swarms that span for meters  and these form because of a parasite. These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm. A tapeworm is effectively a long  living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other. As a freelance journalist  I sympathize. The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body  but it also does other things. It castrates them  it changes their color from transparent to bright red  it makes them live longer  and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found  it makes them swim in groups. Why  Because the tapeworm  like many other parasites  has a complicated life cycle involving many different hosts. The shrimp are just one step on its journey. Its ultimate destination is this  the greater flamingo. Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce  so to get there  it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour  and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm. They aren't sociable through their own volition  but because they are being controlled. It's not safety in numbers. It's actually the exact opposite. The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies  turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo. And here is another example of a parasitic manipulation. This is a suicidal cricket. This cricket swallowed the  larvae of a Gordian worm  or horsehair worm. The worm grew to adult size within it  but it needs to get into water in order to mate  and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain  causing it to behave erratically. When the cricket nears a body of water  such as this swimming pool  it jumps in and drowns  and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse. Crickets are really roomy. Who knew  The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone. They are part of an entire cavalcade of mind controlling parasites  of fungi  viruses  and worms and insects and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts. Now  I first learned about this way of life through David Attenborough's  Trials of Life  about    years ago  and then later through a wonderful book called  Parasite Rex  by my friend Carl Zimmer. And I've been writing about these creatures ever since. Few topics in biology enthrall me more. It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain. Because after all  they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre. When you write about parasites  your lexicon swells with phrases like  devoured alive  and  bursts out of its body.  But there's more to it than that. I'm a writer  and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories. Parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories. Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations. Why  for example  does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over  Is it maybe protecting its siblings  No. This caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it. The eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body. See what I mean  Now  the caterpillar didn't die. Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons. This caterpillar is a head banging  zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it. We have a lot to get through.  I only have    minutes.  Laughter  Now  some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world  that they are outliers  and that point of view is understandable  because by their nature  parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things. They're easy to overlook  but that doesn't mean that they aren't important. A few years back  a man called Kevin Lafferty took a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find  and what they found were parasites in extreme abundance. Especially common were trematodes  tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail. Now  a single trematode is tiny  microscopic  but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds. And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you  the cricket thing  One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato found that in one stream  these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some    percent of the diet of local trout. Manipulation is not an oddity. It is a critical and common part of the world around us  and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators  and more excitingly  they're starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts. And this is one of my favorite examples. This is Ampulex compressa  the emerald cockroach wasp  and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach. When she finds one  she stabs it with a stinger that is also a sense organ. This discovery came out three weeks ago. She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach's brain. So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag  she finds the brain  and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons. Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon. It doesn't kill the roach  nor does it sedate it. The roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to  but it doesn't choose to  because the venom nixes its motivation to walk  and only that. The wasp basically un checks the escape from danger box in the roach's operating system  allowing her to lead her helpless victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog. And once there  she lays an egg on it  egg hatches  devoured alive  bursts out of body  yadda yadda yadda  you know the drill. Now I would argue that  once stung  the cockroach isn't a roach anymore. It's more of an extension of the wasp  just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm. These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce. They have as much control over their own fates as my car. Once the parasites get in  the hosts don't get a say. Now humans  of course  are no stranger to manipulation. We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains and to change our moods  and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind  But our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine grained specificity of the parasites. Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp. Now  I think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling. We place such a premium on our free will and our independence that the prospect of losing those qualities to forces unseen informs many of our deepest societal fears. Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and mind controlling supervillains    these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction  but in nature  they happen all the time. Which leads me to an obvious and disquieting question  Are there dark  sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior without us knowing about it  besides the NSA  If there are any   I've got a red dot on my forehead now  don't I  If there are any  this is a good candidate for them. This is Toxoplasma gondii  or Toxo  for short  because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname. Toxo infects mammals  a wide variety of mammals  but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat. And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse  it turns the rodent into a cat seeking missile. If the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss  it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away. The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex. It's a classic tale of Eat  Prey  Love. You're very charitable  generous people. Hi  Elizabeth  I loved your talk. How does the parasite control its host in this way  We don't really know. We know that Toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine  a substance involved in reward and motivation. We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain  including those involved in sexual arousal. But how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear. What is clear is that this thing is a single cell. This has no nervous system. It has no consciousness. It doesn't even have a body. But it's manipulating a mammal  We are mammals. We are more intelligent than a mere rat  to be sure  but our brains have the same basic structure  the same types of cells  the same chemicals running through them  and the same parasites. Estimates vary a lot  but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Toxo in their brains. Now typically  this doesn't lead to any overt illness. The parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long period of time. But there's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people  that they have a slightly  higher risk of car accidents  and there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected. Now  I think this evidence is still inconclusive  and even among Toxo researchers  opinion is divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior. But given the widespread nature of such manipulations  it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren't similarly affected. And I think that this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing. They're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways  and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing  whether they're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling  are not the results of individuals acting through their own accord but because they are being bent to the control of something else. And while that idea may be disquieting  and while parasites' habits may be very grisly  I think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin. At the end of  On the Origin of Species   Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life  and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful  and I like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks. But perhaps  that's just a parasite talking. Thank you. My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust  protect user rights and keep users safe  both from each other and  at times  from themselves. Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter. Back in January       we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform. January       more than     million. We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes. That's a        percent increase. Now  the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. There's no risk involved. My job is to root out and prevent activity that might. Sounds straightforward  right  You might even think it'd be easy  given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way. Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities  Given the scale that Twitter is at  a one in a million chance happens     times a day. It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale. For us  edge cases  those rare situations that are unlikely to occur  are more like norms. Say   .    percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone. There's no threat involved. Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like Australia's Heart Reef  or tweeting about a concert they're attending  or sharing pictures of cute baby animals. After you take out that   .    percent  that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly         per month. The sheer scale of what we're dealing with makes for a challenge. You know what else makes my role particularly challenging  People do weird things. And I have to figure out what they're doing  why  and whether or not there's risk involved  often without much in terms of context or background. I'm going to show you some examples that I've run into during my time at Twitter    these are all real examples   of situations that at first seemed cut and dried  but the truth of the matter was something altogether different. The details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty. We'll start off easy.   Yo bitch   If you saw a Tweet that only said this  you might think to yourself   That looks like abuse.  After all  why would you want to receive the message   Yo  bitch.  Now  I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes  so I knew that  yo  bitch  was also often a common greeting between friends  as well as being a popular  Breaking Bad  reference. I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case. It turns out it is also used on Twitter when people are role playing as dogs. And in fact  in that case  it's not only not abusive  it's technically just an accurate greeting. So okay  determining whether or not something is abusive without context  definitely hard. Let's look at spam. Here's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior  sending the exact same message to thousands of people. While this is a mockup I put together using my account  we see accounts doing this all the time. Seems pretty straightforward. We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior. Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule. Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it. You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam. Okay. Let's make the stakes higher. Back to my account  again exhibiting classic behavior. This time it's sending the same message and link. This is often indicative of  something called phishing  somebody trying to steal another person's account information by directing them to another website. That's pretty clearly not a good thing. We want to  and do  suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior. So why are the stakes higher for this  Well  this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a non violent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening. We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it. That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors  and even then  we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate. Now  given the sorts of challenges I'm up against  it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected. And that's not just an issue for me  or for Twitter  it's an issue for you. It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things. So what do I do  I pause and I think  how could all of this go horribly wrong  I visualize catastrophe. And that's hard. There's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that  like when you're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement. But you still have to do it  particularly if you're marrying      million tweets per day. What do I mean by  visualize catastrophe   I try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death  and what to do to prevent that. Which happens to be my next example. This is my cat  Eli. We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets. A picture is worth a thousand words. You only get     characters. You add a photo to your tweet  look at how much more content you've got now. There's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet. My job isn't to think of those. It's to think of what could go wrong. How could this picture lead to my death  Well  here's one possibility. There's more in that picture than just a cat. There's geodata. When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera  there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image. In fact  this image also contains the equivalent of this  more specifically  this. Sure  it's not likely that someone's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat  but I start by assuming the worst will happen. That's why  when we launched photos on Twitter  we made the decision to strip that geodata out. If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards  I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases. Given that I spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen  it wouldn't be surprising if  my worldview was gloomy. It's not. The vast majority of interactions I see    and I see a lot  believe me    are positive  people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other. It's just that for those of us dealing with scale  for those of us tasked with keeping people safe  we have to assume the worst will happen  because for us  a one in a million chance is pretty good odds. Thank you. Looking deeply inside nature  through the magnifying glass of science  designers extract principles  processes and materials that are forming the very basis of design methodology. From synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials  to computational methods that emulate neural processes  nature is driving design. Design is also driving nature. In realms of genetics  regenerative medicine and synthetic biology  designers are growing novel technologies  not foreseen or anticipated by nature. Bionics explores the interplay between biology and design. As you can see  my legs are bionic. Today  I will tell human stories of bionic integration  how electromechanics attached to the body  and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability  between human limitation and human potential. Bionics has defined my physicality. In       both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite  incurred during a mountain climbing accident. At that time  I didn't view my body as broken. I reasoned that a human being can never be  broken.  Technology is broken. Technology is inadequate. This simple but powerful idea was a call to arms  to advance technology for the elimination of my own disability  and ultimately  the disability of others. I began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world of rock and ice climbing. I quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable  able to take on any form  any function    a blank slate for which to create  perhaps  structures that could extend beyond biological capability. I made my height adjustable. I could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like. So when I was feeling bad about myself  insecure  I would jack my height up. But when I was feeling confident and suave  I would knock my height down a notch  just to give the competition a chance. Narrow edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures  where the human foot cannot penetrate  and spiked feet enabled me to climb vertical ice walls  without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue. Through technological innovation  I returned to my sport  stronger and better. Technology had eliminated my disability  and allowed me a new climbing prowess. As a young man  I imagined a future world where technology so advanced could rid the world of disability  a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see. A world in which the paralyzed could walk  via body exoskeletons. Sadly  because of deficiencies in technology  disability is rampant in the world. This gentleman is missing three limbs. As a testimony to current technology  he is out of the wheelchair  but we need to do a better job in bionics  to allow  one day  full rehabilitation for a person with this level of injury. At the MIT Media Lab  we've established the Center for Extreme Bionics. The mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans  across a broad range of brain and body disabilities. Today  I'm going to tell you how my legs function  how they work  as a case in point for this center. Now  I made sure to shave my legs last night  because I knew I'd be showing them off. Bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces. There's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs  mechanical  how my limbs are attached to my biological body  dynamic  how they move like flesh and bone  and electrical  how they communicate with my nervous system. I'll begin with mechanical interface. In the area of design  we still do not understand how to attach devices to the body mechanically. It's extraordinary to me that in this day and age  one of the most mature  oldest technologies in the human timeline  the shoe  still gives us blisters. How can this be  We have no idea how to attach things to our bodies. This is the beautifully lyrical design work of Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab  showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances  shown here by color variation in this  D printed model. Imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it  when you need it  for optimal support and flexibility  without ever causing discomfort. My bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations  that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics. To achieve that mirroring  we first developed a mathematical model of my biological limb. To that end  we used imaging tools such as MRI  to look inside my body  to figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues. We also took robotic tools    here's a    actuator circle that goes around the biological limb. The actuators come in  find the surface of the limb  measure its unloaded shape  and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point. We combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my biological limb  shown on the left. You see a bunch of points  or nodes  At each node  there's a color that represents tissue compliance. We then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin  shown on the right. And we've discovered optimality is  where the body is stiff  the synthetic skin should be soft  where the body is soft  the synthetic skin is stiff  and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances. With this framework  we've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn. Clearly  in the future  our clothing  our shoes  our braces  our prostheses  will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies  but rather  data driven quantitative frameworks. In that future  our shoes will no longer give us blisters. We're also embedding sensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins. This is a material developed by SRI International  California. Under electrostatic effect  it changes stiffness. So under zero voltage  the material is compliant  it's floppy like paper. Then the button's pushed  a voltage is applied  and it becomes stiff as a board. We embed this material into the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body. When I walk here  it's no voltage. My interface is soft and compliant. The button's pushed  voltage is applied  and it stiffens  offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb. We're also building exoskeletons. This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle  to protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation. In the future  we'll all be wearing exoskeletons in common activities  such as running. Next  dynamic interface. How do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone  At my MIT lab  we study how humans with normal physiologies stand  walk and run. What are the muscles doing  and how are they controlled by the spinal cord  This basic science motivates what we build. We're building bionic ankles  knees and hips. We're building body parts from the ground up. The bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs. They've been fitted to nearly       patients      of which have been wounded U.S. soldiers. How does it work  At heel strike  under computer control  the system controls stiffness  to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground. Then at mid stance  the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person into the walking stride  comparable to how muscles work in the calf region. This bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients. So on the left  you see the bionic device worn by a lady  on the right  a passive device worn by the same lady  that fails to emulate normal muscle function  enabling her to do something everyone should be able to do  go up and down their steps at home. Bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats. Here's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway. This is Steve Martin    not the comedian    who lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan. We're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles  that wrap around the biological limb. This gentleman does not have any leg condition  any disability. He has a normal physiology  so these exoskeletons are applying muscle like torques and powers  so that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers. This is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking. It significantly reduces metabolic cost. It's so profound in its augmentation  that when a normal  healthy person wears the device for    minutes and then takes it off  their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward. We're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient. Moving on to electrical interface  How do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system  Across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles. That's communicated to the bionic limb  so when I think about moving my phantom limb  the robot tracks those movement desires. This diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled. So we model the missing biological limb  and we've discovered what reflexes occurred  how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles. And that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb. What we've done  then  is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex  the modeled spinal reflex  with the neural signal  so when I relax my muscles in my residual limb  I get very little torque and power  but the more I fire my muscles  the more torque I get  and I can even run. And that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command. Feels great. We want to go a step further. We want to actually close the loop between the human and the bionic external limb. We're doing experiments where we're growing nerves  transected nerves  through channels  or micro channel arrays. On the other side of the channel  the nerve then attaches to cells  skin cells and muscle cells. In the motor channels  we can sense how the person wishes to move. That can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb  then  sensory information  on the bionic limb can be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels  sensory channels. So when this is fully developed and for human use  persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone  but actually feel like flesh and bone. This video shows Lisa Mallette  shortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs. Indeed  bionics is making a profound difference in people's lives. LM  Oh my God  I can't believe it  LM  It's just like I've got a real leg  Woman  Now  don't start running. Man  Now turn around  and do the same thing walking up  but get on your heel to toe  like you would normally just walk on level ground. Try to walk right up the hill. LM  Oh my God. Man  Is it pushing you up  LM  Yes  I'm not even    I can't even describe it. Man  It's pushing you right up. Hugh Herr  Next week  I'm visiting the Center    Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next week I'm visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  and I'm going to try to convince CMS to grant appropriate code language and pricing  so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it. Thank you. It's not well appreciated  but over half of the world's population suffers from some form of cognitive  emotional  sensory or motor condition  and because of poor technology  too often  conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life. Basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights. Every person should have the right to live life without disability if they so choose    the right to live life without severe depression  the right to see a loved one  in the case of seeing impaired  or the right to walk or to dance  in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation. As a society  we can achieve these human rights  if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled. A person can never be broken. Our built environment  our technologies  are broken and disabled. We the people need not accept our limitations  but can transcend disability through technological innovation. Indeed  through fundamental advances in bionics in this century  we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience  and we will end disability. I'd like to finish up with one more story  a beautiful story. The story of Adrianne Haslet Davis. Adrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack. I met Adrianne when this photo was taken  at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Adrianne is a dancer  a ballroom dancer. Adrianne breathes and lives dance. It is her expression. It is her art form. Naturally  when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack  she wanted to return to the dance floor. After meeting her and driving home in my car  I thought  I'm an MIT professor. I have resources. Let's build her a bionic limb  to enable her to go back to her life of dance. I brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics  robotics  machine learning and biomechanics  and over a     day research period  we studied dance. We brought in dancers with biological limbs  and we studied how they move  what forces they apply on the dance floor  and we took those data  and we put forth fundamental principles of dance  reflexive dance capability  and we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb. Bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster. Our expression  our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics. It was  .  seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack. In  .  seconds  the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor. In     days  we put her back. We will not be intimidated  brought down  diminished  conquered or stopped by acts of violence. Ladies and gentlemen  please allow me to introduce Adrianne Haslet Davis  her first performance since the attack. She's dancing with Christian Lightner. Ladies and gentlemen  members of the research team  Elliott Rouse and Nathan Villagaray Carski. Elliott and Nathan. The world makes you something that you're not  but you know inside what you are  and that question burns in your heart  How will you become that  I may be somewhat unique in this  but I am not alone  not alone at all. So when I became a fashion model  I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream that I'd always wanted since I was a young child. My outside self finally matched my inner truth  my inner self. For complicated reasons which I'll get to later  when I look at this picture  at that time I felt like  Geena  you've done it  you've made it  you have arrived. But this past October  I realized that I'm only just beginning. All of us are put in boxes by our family  by our religion  by our society  our moment in history  even our own bodies. Some people have the courage to break free  not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin or by the beliefs of those that surround them. Those people are always the threat to the status quo  to what is considered acceptable. In my case  for the last nine years  some of my neighbors  some of my friends  colleagues  even my agent  did not know about my history. I think  in mystery  this is called the reveal. Here is mine. I was assigned boy at birth based on the appearance of my genitalia. I remember when I was five years old in the Philippines walking around our house  I would always wear this t shirt on my head. And my mom asked me   How come you always wear that t shirt on your head   I said   Mom  this is my hair. I'm a girl.  I knew then how to self identify. Gender has always been considered a fact  immutable  but we now know it's actually more fluid  complex and mysterious. Because of my success  I never had the courage to share my story  not because I thought what I am is wrong  but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free. Every day  I am so grateful because I am a woman. I have a mom and dad and family who accepted me for who I am. Many are not so fortunate. There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender. There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion. There is a Hindu goddess  hijra goddess. So when I was eight years old  I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating these mysteries. I was in front of the stage  and I remember  out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me  and I remember that moment something hit me  That is the kind of woman I would like to be. So when I was    years old  still dressing as a boy  I met this woman named T.L. She is a transgender beauty pageant manager. That night she asked me   How come you are not joining the beauty pageant   She convinced me that if I joined that she would take care of the registration fee and the garments  and that night  I won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up among    plus candidates. That moment changed my life. All of a sudden  I was introduced to the world of beauty pageants. Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women  but I'll take it. So from    to    years old  I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck  literally  or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field  and when it rains    it rains a lot in the Philippines    the organizers would have to move it inside someone's house. I also experienced the goodness of strangers  especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the Philippines. But most importantly  I met some of my best friends in that community. In       my mom  who had moved to San Francisco  called me and told me that my green card petition came through  that I could now move to the United States. I resisted it. I told my mom   Mom  I'm having fun. I'm here with my friends  I love traveling  being a beauty pageant queen.  But then two weeks later she called me  she said   Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender marker   That was all I needed to hear. My mom also told me to put two E's in the spelling of my name. She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at    years old. It's interesting  in some of the most rural cities in Thailand  they perform some of the most prestigious  safe and sophisticated surgery. At that time in the United States  you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker. So in       I moved to San Francisco  and I remember looking at my California driver's license with the name Geena and gender marker F. That was a powerful moment. For some people  their I.D. is their license to drive or even to get a drink  but for me  that was my license to live  to feel dignified. All of a sudden  my fears were minimized. I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York and be a model. Many are not so fortunate. I think of this woman named Islan Nettles. She's from New York  she's a young woman who was courageously living her truth  but hatred ended her life. For most of my community  this is the reality in which we live. Our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general population. Every November     we have a global vigil for Transgender Day of Remembrance. I'm here at this stage because it's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice. This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Today  this very moment  is my real coming out. I could no longer live my truth for and by myself. I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror. I am here  exposed  so that one day there will never be a need for a November    vigil. My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am. Will you  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Kathryn Schulz  Geena  one quick question for you. I'm wondering what you would say  especially to parents  but in a more broad way  to friends  to family  to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that's being assigned them  what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them  Geena Rocero  Sure. Well  first  really  I'm so blessed. The support system  with my mom especially  and my family  that in itself is just so powerful. I remember every time I would coach young trans women  I would mentor them  and sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can't accept it  I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom   Mom  can you call this woman   And sometimes it works  sometimes it doesn't  so   But it's just  gender identity is in the core of our being  right  I mean  we're all assigned gender at birth  so what I'm trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match  and there should be a space that would allow people to self identify  and that's a conversation that we should have with parents  with colleagues. The transgender movement  it's at the very beginning  to compare to how the gay movement started. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. There should be an understanding. There should be a space of curiosity and asking questions  and I hope all of you guys will be my allies. KS  Thank you. That was so lovely. GR  Thank you.
