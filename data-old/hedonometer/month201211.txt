I think the beautiful Malin  Akerman  put it perfectly. Every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury. Ladies and gentlemen  and more importantly  Mo Bros and Mo Sistas    Laughter    for the next    minutes  I'm going to share with you my Movember journey  and how  through that journey  we've redefined charity  we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world  and I hope  through that process  that I inspire you to create something significant in your life  something significant that will go on and make this world a better place. So the most common question I get asked  and I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight  is how did this come about  How did Movember start  Well  normally  a charity starts with the cause  and someone that is directly affected by a cause. They then go on to create an event  and beyond that  a foundation to support that. Pretty much in every case  that's how a charity starts. Not so with Movember. Movember started in a very traditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon. I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers  and I was watching the world go by  had a few more beers  and the conversation turned to '  s fashion    Laughter    and how everything manages to come back into style. And a few more beers  I said   There has to be some stuff that hasn't come back.   Laughter  Then one more beer and it was  whatever happened to the mustache  Why hasn't that made a comeback   Laughter  So then there was a lot more beers  and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back.  Laughter  So in Australia   mo  is slang for mustache  so we renamed the month of November  Movember  and created some pretty basic rules  which still stand today. And they are  start the month clean shaven  rock a mustache    not a beard  not a goatee  a mustache    for the    days of November  and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month  have a mustache themed party  and award a prize for the best  and of course  the worst mustache.  Laughter  Now trust me  when you're growing a mustache back in       and there were    of us back then  and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement    Laughter    it created a lot of controversy.  Laughter  So my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients. My girlfriend at the time  who's no longer my girlfriend    Laughter    hated it. Parents would shuffle kids away from us.  Laughter  But we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey  and it was a real journey. And we had a lot of fun  and in       I said to the guys   That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year.   Laughter  So we started thinking about that  and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer. And we thought  you know what  there's nothing for men's health. Why is that  Why can't we combine growing a mustache and doing something for men's health  And I started to research that topic  and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it. But there was nothing for this cause  so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer  and then we created our tagline  which is   Changing the face of men's health.  And that eloquently describes the challenge  changing your appearance for the    days  and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve  getting men engaged in their health  having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face. So with that model  I then cold called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation. I said to him   I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization.   Laughter  And I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone  so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in     . And we sat down  and I shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia  raising awareness for this cause  and funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership to legitimately do that. And I said   We're going to come together at the end  we're going to have a mustache themed party  we're going to have DJs  we're going to celebrate life  and we're going to change the face of men's health.  And he just looked at me and laughed  and he said  he said   Adam  that's a really novel idea  but we're an ultraconservative organization. We can't have anything to do with you.   Laughter  So I paid for coffee that day    Laughter    and his parting comment as we shook hands was   Listen  if you happen to raise any money out of this  we'll gladly take it.   Laughter  So my lesson that year was persistence. And we persisted  and we got     guys growing mustaches  and together we raised        dollars  and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia  and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received. So from that day forward  my life has become about a mustache. Every day    this morning  I wake up and go  my life is about a mustache.  Laughter  Essentially  I'm a mustache farmer.  Laughter  And my season is November.  Applause  So in       the campaign got more momentum  was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand  and then in      we came to a pivotal point. It was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought  we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level. It's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches.  Laughter  Let me tell you that there's not too many people interested in investing in that  not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation  who we'd raised about  .  million dollars for at that stage. So again we persisted  and Foster's Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever sponsorship  and that was enough for me to quit my job  I did consulting on the side. And leading into Movember       we'd run through all the money from Foster's  we'd run through all the money I had  and essentially we had no money left  and we'd convinced all our suppliers    creative agencies  web development agencies  hosting companies  whatnot    to delay their billing until December. So we'd racked up at this stage about         dollars worth of debt. So if Movember      didn't happen  the four founders  well  we would've been broke  we would've been homeless  sitting on the street with mustaches.  Laughter  But we thought  you know what  if that's the worst thing that happens  so what  We're going to have a lot of fun doing it  and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks. Then in early       a really interesting thing happened. We had Mo Bros from Canada  from the U.S.  and from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying  hey  there's nothing for prostate cancer. Bring this campaign to these countries. So we thought  why not  Let's do it. So I cold called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada  and I said to him   I have this most amazing concept.   It's going to transform your organization. I don't want to tell you about it now  but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto   So I flew here  met down on Front Street East  and we sat in the boardroom  and I said   Right  here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization.  And he looked at me and laughed and said   Adam  sounds like a really novel idea  but we're an ultraconservative organization.   Laughter  I've heard this before. I know how it goes. But he said   We will partner with you  but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work.  So what we did was  we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country  the U.S  and the U.K.  and we did that because we knew  if this was successful  we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia. And that money fuels research  and that research will get us to a cure. And we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure  we're about finding the cure. So in       we brought the campaign across here  and it was  it set the stage for the campaign. It wasn't as successful as we thought it would be. We were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage. So that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets. But what I'm really pleased to say is  in       Movember became a truly global movement. Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world. Last year we had         Mo Bros spread across the world and together we raised    million dollars. And that makes Movember now the biggest funder of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world. And that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches.  Laughter  And for us  we have redefined charity. Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon.  Laughter  Our ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas  and I think that's been fundamental to our success. We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people. We let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way. So now I live in Los Angeles  because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there  and I always get asked by the media down there  because it's so celebrity driven   Who are your celebrity ambassadors   And I say to them   Last year we were fortunate enough to have         celebrity ambassadors.  And they go   What  what do you mean   And it's like  everything single person  every single Mo Bro and Mo Sista that participates in Movember is our celebrity ambassador  and that is so  so important and fundamental to our success. Now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching Movember moments  and it happened here in Toronto last year  at the end of the campaign. I was out with a team. It was the end of Movember. We'd had a great campaign  and to be honest  we'd had our fair share of beer that night  but I said   You know what  I think we've got one more bar left in us.   Laughter  So we piled into a taxi  and this is our taxi driver  and I was sitting in the back seat  and he turned around and said   Where are you going   And I said   Hang on  that is an amazing mustache.  And he said   I'm doing it for Movember.  And I said   So am I.  And I said   Tell me your Movember story.  And he goes   Listen  I know it's about men's health  I know it's about prostate cancer  but this is for breast cancer.  And I said   Okay  that's interesting.  And he goes   Last year  my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka  because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her   and he said   This mustache is my tribute to my mom.  And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi  and I didn't tell him who I was  because I didn't think it was appropriate  and I just shook his hand and I said   Thank you so much. Your mom would be so proud.  And from that moment I realized that Movember is so much more than a mustache  having a joke. It's about each person coming to this platform  embracing it in their own way  and being significant in their own life. For us now at Movember  we really focus on three program areas  and having a true impact  awareness and education  survivor support programs  and research. Now we always focus  naturally  on how much we raise  because it's a very tangible outcome  but for me  awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise  because I know that is changing and saving lives today  and it's probably best exampled by a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin  Texas  at the start of the year. He came up to me and said   Thank you for starting Movember.  And I said   Thank you for doing Movember.  And I looked at him  and I was like   I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache.   Laughter  And I said   What's your Movember story   And he said   I grew the worst mustache ever.   Laughter   But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner  and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on.   Laughter   And we talked    I talked to them about Movember  and then after that  my dad came up to me  and at the age of     for the first time ever  I had a conversation with my dad one on one about men's health. I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer  and I learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease  and he didn't know that  and he hadn't been getting screened for it.  So now  that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer. So those conversations  getting men engaged in this  at whatever age  is so critically important  and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise. Now to the funds we raise  and research  and how we're redefining research. We fund prostate cancer foundations now in    countries. We literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world  and when we looked at this more recently  we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions  let alone nationally  let alone globally  and this is not unique to prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over. And so we said  right  we'd redefined charity. We need to redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that  So what we did was  we created a global action plan  and we're taking    percent of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund  and we've got the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world that look after that fund  and they come together each year and identify the number one priority  and that  last year  was getting a better screening test. So they identified that as a priority  and then they've got and recruited now     researchers from around the world that are studying that topic  essentially the same topic. So now we're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together  and that's a unique thing in the cancer world  and we know  through that collaboration  it will accelerate outcomes. And that's how we're redefining the research world. So  what I know about my Movember journey is that  with a really creative idea  with passion  with persistence  and a lot of patience  four mates  four mustaches  can inspire a room full of people  and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city  and that city is Melbourne  my home. And that city can go on and inspire a state  and that state can go on and inspire a nation  and beyond that  you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health. My name is Adam Garone  and that's my story. Thank you.  Applause  Today I have just one request. Please don't tell me I'm normal. Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers. Remi is     tall and very handsome. He's speechless  but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot. Remi knows what love is. He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless. He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color. He doesn't care about religious differences  and get this  He has never told a lie. When he sings songs from our childhood  attempting words that not even I could remember  he reminds me of one thing  how little we know about the mind  and how wonderful the unknown must be. Samuel is   . He's tall. He's very handsome. He has the most impeccable memory. He has a selective one  though. He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar  but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod  conversations we had when he was four  weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies  and Lady Gaga's birthday. Don't they sound incredible  But most people don't agree. And in fact  because their minds don't fit into society's version of normal  they're often bypassed and misunderstood. But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case  although they were not seen as ordinary  this could only mean one thing  that they were extraordinary    autistic and extraordinary. Now  for you who may be less familiar with the term  autism   it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication  learning and sometimes physical skills. It manifests in each individual differently  hence why Remi is so different from Sam. And across the world  every    minutes  one new person is diagnosed with autism  and although it's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world  there is no known cause or cure. And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism  but I cannot recall a day without it. I was just three years old when my brother came along  and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life. And after a few months went by  I realized that he was different. He screamed a lot. He didn't want to play like the other babies did  and in fact  he didn't seem very interested in me whatsoever. Remi lived and reigned in his own world  with his own rules  and he found pleasure in the smallest things  like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between. And as he grew older  he grew more different  and the differences became more obvious. Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never ending hyperactivity was something really unique  a pure and innocent nature  a boy who saw the world without prejudice  a human who had never lied. Extraordinary. Now  I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family  moments where I've wished that they were just like me. But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me about individuality and communication and love  and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change with normality. Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us  and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong. It just means that there's a different kind of right. And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you  it would be that you don't have to be normal. You can be extraordinary. Because autistic or not  the differences that we have    We've got a gift  Everyone's got a gift inside of us  and in all honesty  the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential. The chance for greatness  for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else. Please    don't tell me I'm normal. Thank you.  Applause  So  people want a lot of things out of life  but I think  more than anything else  they want happiness. Aristotle called happiness  the chief good   the end towards which all other things aim. According to this view  the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable. It's that we expect them to bring us happiness. Now in the last    years  we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want. We're richer. We live longer. We have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago. The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically  we haven't actually gotten any happier. Maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness  there's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself. People have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time  in fact for thousands of years  but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved. Well  as with many other domains in life  I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question. In fact  in the last few years  there's been an explosion in research on happiness. For example  we've learned a lot about its demographics  how things like income and education  gender and marriage relate to it. But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect. Yes  it's better to make more money rather than less  or to graduate from college instead of dropping out  but the differences in happiness tend to be small. Which leaves the question  what are the big causes of happiness  I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet  but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment to moment experiences. It certainly seems that we're going about our lives  that what we're doing  who we're with  what we're thinking about  have a big influence on our happiness  and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult  in fact almost impossible  for scientists to study. A few years ago  I came up with a way to study people's happiness moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world  something we'd never been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org  it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time. How does this work  Basically  I send people signals at random points throughout the day  and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment to moment experience at the instant just before the signal. The idea is that  if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day  minute to minute in some cases  and try to understand how what people are doing  who they're with  what they're thinking about  and all the other factors that describe our day  how those might relate to those changes in happiness  we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness. We've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data  a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before  over         real time reports from over        people. And it's not just a lot of people  it's a really diverse group  people from a wide range of ages  from    to late   s  a wide range of incomes  education levels  people who are married  divorced  widowed  etc. They collectively represent every one of    occupational categories and hail from over    countries. What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been investigating  and that's mind wandering. As human beings  we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present. This guy is sitting here working on his computer  and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month  wondering what he's going to have for dinner. Maybe he's worried that he's going bald.  Laughter  This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can. And yet it's not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness. You've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present.  Be here now   you've probably heard a hundred times. Maybe  to really be happy  we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment. Maybe these people are right. Maybe mind wandering is a bad thing. On the other hand  when our minds wander  they're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality in front of us  but we can go anywhere in our minds. Since we know people want to be happy  maybe when our minds wander  they're going to someplace happier than the place that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense. In other words  maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering. Well  since I'm a scientist  I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data  and in particular I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember  this is from sort of moment to moment experience in people's real lives. There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question  How do you feel  on a scale ranging from very bad to very good  Second  an activity question  What are you doing  on a list of    different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV  And finally a mind wandering question  Are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing  People could say no    in other words  I'm focused only on my task    or yes    I am thinking about something else    and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant  neutral or unpleasant. Any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering. So what did we find  This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis  and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they're focused on the present  when they're not mind wandering. As it turns out  people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not. Now you might look at this result and say  okay  sure  on average people are less happy when they're mind wandering  but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with  at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us. Nope. As it turns out  people are less happy when they're mind wandering no matter what they're doing. For example  people don't really like commuting to work very much. It's one of their least enjoyable activities  and yet they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else. It's amazing. So how could this be happening  I think part of the reason  a big part of the reason  is that when our minds wander  we often think about unpleasant things  and they are enormously less happy when they do that  our worries  our anxieties  our regrets  and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral  they're still considerably less happy than when they're not mind wandering at all. Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant  they're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren't mind wandering. If mind wandering were a slot machine  it would be like having the chance to lose    dollars     dollars or one dollar. Right  You'd never want to play.  Laughter  So I've been talking about this  suggesting  perhaps  that mind wandering causes unhappiness  but all I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated. It's possible that's the case  but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy  then they mind wander. Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever disentangle these two possibilites  Well  one fact that we can take advantage of  I think a fact you'll all agree is true  is that time goes forward  not backward. Right  The cause has to come before the effect. We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person  and so we can look and see  does mind wandering tend to precede unhappiness  or does unhappiness tend to precede mind wandering  to get some insight into the causal direction. As it turns out  there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later  consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy. In contrast  there's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later. In other words  mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause  and not merely a consequence  of unhappiness. A few minutes ago  I likened mind wandering to a slot machine you'd never want to play. Well  how often do people's minds wander  Turns out  they wander a lot. In fact  really a lot. Forty seven percent of the time  people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing. How does that depend on what people are doing  This shows the rate of mind wandering across    activities ranging from a high of    percent    Laughter    when people are taking a shower  brushing their teeth  to    percent when they're working  to    percent when they're exercising  all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at. Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex.  Laughter  But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph  and that is  basically with one exception  no matter what people are doing  they're mind wandering at least    percent of the time  which suggests  I think  that mind wandering isn't just frequent  it's ubiquitous. It pervades basically everything that we do. In my talk today  I've told you a little bit about mind wandering  a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness. My hope is that over time  by tracking people's moment to moment happiness and their experiences in daily life  we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness  and then in the end  a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that's not only richer and healthier  but happier as well. Thank you.  Applause  Two years ago  after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan  I found myself in Port au Prince  leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of the hardest hit areas of that city  three days after the earthquake. We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go  the places nobody else could go  and after three weeks  we realized something. Military veterans are very  very good at disaster response. And coming home  my cofounder and I  we looked at it  and we said  there are two problems. The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response. It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology  and it's not using the best people. The second problem that we became aware of was a very inadequate veteran reintegration  and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan  and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life. And we sat here and we looked at these two problems  and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems. These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that  Well  we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home. Recent surveys show that    percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform. And we can use veterans to improve disaster response. Now on the surface  this makes a lot of sense  and in       we responded to the tsunami in Chile  the floods in Pakistan  we sent training teams to the Thai Burma border. But it was earlier this year  when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization. This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me. We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay was with us in Port au Prince. He was also with us in Chile. Earlier this year  in March  Clay took his own life. This was a tragedy  but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing. You know  Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself because of what he lost when he came home. He lost purpose. He lost his community. And perhaps most tragically  he lost his self worth. And so  as we evaluated  and as the dust settled from this tragedy  we realized that  of those two problems    in the initial iteration of our organization  we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service. We had a lot of success  and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm. But after Clay  we shifted that focus  and suddenly  now moving forward  we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response. Because we think that we can give that purpose and that community and that self worth back to the veteran. And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin  and then later Hurricane Irene  gave us an opportunity to look at that. Now I want you to imagine for a second an    year old boy who graduates from high school in Kansas City  Missouri. He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle. They send him to Iraq. Every day he leaves the wire with a mission. That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home. It's to keep the men around him alive. It's to pacify the village that he works in. He's got a purpose. But he comes home  to  Kansas City  Missouri  maybe he goes to college  maybe he's got a job  but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose. You give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin  Missouri after a tornado  he regains that. Going back  that same    year old boy graduates from high school in Kansas City  Missouri  joins the Army  the Army gives him a rifle  they send him to Iraq. Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him. He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back. He's slept in the same sand. They've lived together. They've eaten together. They've bled together. He goes home to Kansas City  Missouri. He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off. He doesn't have that community anymore. But you drop    of those veterans in Joplin  Missouri  they get that sense of community back. Again  you have an    year old boy who graduates high school in Kansas City. He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle. They send him to Iraq. They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade. He takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City. He doesn't have that same self worth. But you send him to Joplin after a tornado  and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service  now they have self worth again. I think it's very important  because right now somebody needs to step up  and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance. Thank you very much.  Applause  So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view  and this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world. I've found  after doing this for many  many years  that there's a magical world behind reality. And that can be seen directly through a microscope  and I'm going to show you some of this today. So let's start off looking at something rather not so small  something that we can see with our naked eye  and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee  it's about this size here  it's about a centimeter. But to really see the details of the bee  and really appreciate what it is  you have to look a little bit closer. So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope  and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia  and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they're right up close to something  because they can't see in stereo. As we go smaller  here is a human hair. A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see. It's about a tenth of a millimeter. And as we go smaller again  about ten times smaller than that  is a cell. So you could fit    human cells across the diameter of a human hair. So when we would look at cells  this is how I really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope. When I first saw living cells in a microscope  I was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like. So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system  they're actually moving all over the place. This cell is looking for foreign objects  bacteria  things that it can find. And it's looking around  and when it finds something  and recognizes it being foreign  it will actually engulf it and eat it. So if you look right there  it finds that little bacterium  and it engulfs it and eats it. If you take some heart cells from an animal  and put it in a dish  they'll just sit there and beat. That's their job. Every cell has a mission in life  and these cells  the mission is to move blood around our body. These next cells are nerve cells  and right now  as we see and understand what we're looking at  our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this right now. They're not just static. They're moving around making new connections  and that's what happens when we learn. As you go farther down this scale here  that's a micron  or a micrometer  and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom. Now  an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom. That's how small that is. And microscopes that we have today can actually see individual atoms. So these are some pictures of individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom. This is a ring of cobalt atoms. So this whole world  the nano world  this area in here is called the nano world  and the nano world  the whole micro world that we see  there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that  and the whole    and that is the world of molecules and atoms. But I want to talk about this larger world  the world of the micro world. So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower  what would that flower look like  if the flower was this big  It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here  and you're a little bug  if you're on that surface of that flower  that's what the terrain would look like. The petal of that flower looks like that  so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects  and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here  this is the style of that flower  and you notice that it's got these little    these are like little jelly like things that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs. So this little ant that's crawling here  it's like it's in a little Willy Wonka land. It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see. These are little bits of individual grain of pollen there and there  and here is a    what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen  when you look in a microscope  it's actually made of thousands of little grains of pollen. So this  for example  when you see bees flying around these little plants  and they're collecting pollen  those pollen grains that they're collecting  they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive  and that's what makes the beehive  the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar  and that's what makes the honey that we eat. Here's a close up picture  or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth  and if you had really  really good vision  with your naked eye  you'd see it about that well. There's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen. So that's thousands of little grains of pollen there  and there's the pistil there  and these are the little things called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give a fragrance  and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances. I want to talk about something really ordinary  just ordinary sand. I became interested in sand about    years ago  when I first saw sand from Maui  and in fact  this is a little bit of sand from Maui. So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size. Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size. But when you look closer at this  look at what's there. It's really quite amazing. You have microshells there. You have things like coral. You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine. You have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit of a volcano there. You have tube worms. An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand. And the reason that is  is because in a place like this island  a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow  and when they die  their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand  things like coral and so forth. So here's  for example  a picture of sand from Maui. This is from Lahaina  and when we're walking along a beach  we're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history. We don't realize it  but it's actually a record of that entire ecology. So here we see  for example  a sponge spicule  two bits of coral here  that's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff. So when I first looked at this  I was    I thought  gee  this is like a little treasure trove here. I couldn't believe it  and I'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them. Here's what most of the sand in our world looks like. These are quartz crystals and feldspar  so most sand in the world on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock. So mountains are built up  and they erode away by water and rain and ice and so forth  and they become grains of sand. There's some sand that's really much more colorful. These are sand from near the Great Lakes  and you can see that it's filled with minerals like pink garnet and green epidote  all kinds of amazing stuff  and if you look at different sands from different places  every single beach  every single place you look at sand  it's different. Here's from Big Sur  like they're little jewels. There are places in Africa where they do the mining of jewels  and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean  and it's like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope. So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different. Every single grain is different. There are no two grains of sand alike in the world. Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere. They're like a snapshot in time. Now sand is not only on Earth  but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact  outer space is filled with sand  and that sand comes together to make our planets and the Moon. And you can see those in micrometeorites. This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me  and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole. And they're quite amazing looking  and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in    the planets and the Moon. So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand  so they sent me sand from all the different landings of the Apollo missions that happened    years ago. And I started taking pictures with my three dimensional microscopes. This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing. I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon  which is sort of interesting. Now  the way my microscopes work is  normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time  so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope  keep taking pictures  and then I have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like  and I do that in  D. So there  you can see  is a left eye view. There's a right eye view. So sort of left eye view  right eye view. Now something's interesting here. This looks very different than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen  and I've seen a lot of sand on Earth  believe me.  Laughter  Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon. Now  the Moon has no atmosphere  so micrometeorites come in continuously  and the whole surface of the Moon is covered with powder now  because for four billion years it's been bombarded by micrometeorites  and when micrometeorites come in at about    to        miles an hour  they vaporize on contact. And you can see here that that is    that's sort of vaporized  and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together. This is a very small grain of sand  this whole thing. And that's called a ring agglutinate. And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that  and you'd never find that on Earth. Most of the sand on the Moon  especially    and you know when you look at the Moon  there's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas are lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows  and that's what this sand looks like  very similar to the sand that you would see in Haleakala. Other sands  when these micrometeorites come in  they vaporize and they make these fountains  these microscopic fountains that go up into the    I was going to say  up into the air   but there is no air    goes sort of up  and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly  and they harden  and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the Moon  they have these beautiful colored glass spherules. And these are actually microscopic  you need a microscope to see these. Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon  and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there. This grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old  and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling  air  and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the Sun  has these solar storms  and that's erosion by solar radiation. So what I've been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view. I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said   To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower  hold infinity in the palm of your hand  and eternity in an hour.  Thank you.  Applause  Across Europe and Central Asia  approximately one million children live in large residential institutions  usually known as orphanages. Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children. Others know more about the living conditions there  but still think they're a necessary evil. After all  where else would we put all of those children who don't have any parents  But    years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development  and this is particularly true for young babies. As we know  babies are born without their full muscle development  and that includes the brain. During the first three years of life  the brain grows to its full size  with most of that growth taking place in the first six months. The brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation. Every time a young baby learns something new    to focus its eyes  to mimic a movement or a facial expression  to pick something up  to form a word or to sit up    new synaptic connections are being built in the brain. New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning. They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness. They communicate their delight to their children  who respond with smiles  and a desire to achieve more and to learn more. This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical  social  language  cognitive and psychomotor development. It is the model for all future relationships with friends  with partners and with their own children. It happens so naturally in most families that we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware of its importance to human development and  by extension  to the development of a healthy society. And it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children. In August        I had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting. Those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of Romania after the      revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions. I was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families. Housing     babies  this was Ceausescu's show orphanage  and so I'd been told the conditions were much better. Having worked with lots of young children  I expected the institution to be a riot of noise  but it was as silent as a convent. It was hard to believe there were any children there at all  yet the director showed me into room after room  each containing row upon row of cots  in each of which lay a child staring into space. In a room of    newborns  not one of them was crying. Yet I could see soiled nappies  and I could see that some of the children were distressed  but the only noise was a low  continuous moan. The head nurse told me proudly   You see  our children are very well behaved.  Over the next few days  I began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional. The newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours  but their demands were not met  and so eventually they learned not to bother. Within a few days  they were listless  lethargic  and staring into space like all the others. Over the years  many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children  but often  one member of staff is caring for         and even    children. Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program. The children must be woken at   and fed at     . At    their nappies must be changed  so a staff member may have only    minutes to feed    or    children. If a child soils its nappy at       he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again. The child's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing  and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling  the walls or the bars of their cots. Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution  I've seen hundreds of such places across    countries  from the Czech Republic to Sudan. Across all of these diverse lands and cultures  the institutions  and the child's journey through them  is depressingly similar. Lack of stimulation often leads to self stimulating behaviors like hand flapping  rocking back and forth  or aggression  and in some institutions  psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children  whilst in others  children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others. These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities. Most of these children will never leave the institution again. For those without disabilities  at age three  they're transferred to another institution  and at age seven  to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender  they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings  often without even a chance to say goodbye. There's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry. The older children bully the little ones. They learn to survive. They learn to defend themselves  or they go under. When they leave the institution  they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society. In Moldova  young women raised in institutions are    times more likely to be trafficked than their peers  and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions  young adults     percent of them had a criminal record     percent were involved in prostitution  and    percent had taken their own lives. But why are there so many orphans in Europe when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years  In fact  more than    percent of these children have living parents  and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children  but research shows that most parents want their children  and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty  disability and ethnicity. Many countries have not developed inclusive schools  and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school  at age six or seven. The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home. If the family's poor  they find it difficult to visit  and gradually the relationship breaks down. Behind each of the million children in institutions  there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they've run out of options  like Natalia in Moldova  who only had enough money to feed her baby  and so had to send her older son to the institution  or Desi  in Bulgaria  who looked after her four children at home until her husband died  but then she had to go out to work full time  and with no support  felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution  or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they're pregnant  who leave their babies in a hospital  or the new parents  the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability  and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child's potential  are told by the doctors   Forget her  leave her in the institution  go home and make a healthy one.  This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable. Every child has the right to a family  deserves and needs a family  and children are amazingly resilient. We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on  they recover their developmental delays  and go on to lead normal  happy lives. It's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions. One study suggests that a family support service costs    percent of an institutional placement  whilst good quality foster care costs usually about    percent. If we spend less on these children but on the right services  we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs. Across Europe  a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania nearly    years ago  there were         children living in institutions  and more entering every day. Now  there are less than         and family support services are provided across the country. In Moldova  despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis  the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than    percent in the last five years  and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools. Many countries have developed national action plans for change. The European Commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support  empowering communities to look after their own children. But there is still much to be done to end the systematic institutionalization of children. Awareness raising is required at every level of society. People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children  and the better alternatives that exist. If we know people who are planning to support orphanages  we should convince them to support family services instead. Together  this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime. Thank you.  Applause  Let me tell you  it has been a fantastic month for deception. And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race.  Laughter  We have a high profile journalist caught for plagiarism  a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves  a New York Times expos  on fake book reviews. It's been fantastic. Now  of course  not all deception hits the news. Much of the deception is everyday. In fact  a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day  as Dave suggested. So it's about      now  suggests that most of us should have lied. Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you  in the last    hours    think back    have told a little fib  or a big one  How many have told a little lie out there  All right  good. These are all the liars. Make sure you pay attention to them.  Laughter  No  that looked good  it was about two thirds of you. The other third didn't lie  or perhaps forgot  or you're lying to me about your lying  which is very  very devious.  Laughter  This fits with a lot of the research  which suggests that lying is very pervasive. It's this pervasiveness  combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human  the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up  that has fascinated people throughout history. Here we have Diogenes with his lantern. Does anybody know what he was looking for  A single honest man  and he died without finding one back in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East who was really concerned with sincerity  not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk  but that you believed in what you were doing. You believed in your principles. Now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys  a couple thousand years. I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid '  s. Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders. You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact  that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders.  Laughter  Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here in customs  one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong  and I'll tell you about some of that tonight. But even since just       '    the way we communicate has been completely transformed. We email  we text  we skype  we Facebook. It's insane. Almost every aspect of human communication's been changed  and of course that's had an impact on deception. Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we've been tracking and documenting. They're called the Butler  the Sock Puppet and the Chinese Water Army. It sounds a little bit like a weird book  but actually they're all new types of lies. Let's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one   On my way.  Anybody ever written   On my way   Then you've also lied.  Laughter  We're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way. Here's another one   Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier. My battery was dead.  Your battery wasn't dead. You weren't in a dead zone. You just didn't want to respond to that person that time. Here's the last one  You're talking to somebody  and you say   Sorry  got work  gotta go.  But really  you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else. Each of these is about a relationship  and this is a      connected world. Once you get my cell phone number  you can literally be in touch with me    hours a day. And so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer  like the butler used to do  between us and the connections to everybody else. But they're very special. They use ambiguity that comes from using technology. You don't know where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with. And they're aimed at protecting the relationships. These aren't just people being jerks. These are people that are saying  look  I don't want to talk to you now  or I didn't want to talk to you then  but I still care about you. Our relationship is still important. Now  the Sock Puppet  on the other hand  is a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't about ambiguity  per se. It's about identity. Let me give you a very recent example  as in  like  last week. Here's R.J. Ellory  best seller author in Britain. Here's one of his bestselling books. Here's a reviewer online  on Amazon. My favorite  by Nicodemus Jones  is   Whatever else it might do  it will touch your soul.  And of course  you might suspect that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory. He wrote very  very positive reviews about himself. Surprise  surprise. Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new. Walt Whitman also did this back in the day  before there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale  which is the domain of the Chinese Water Army. Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people in China that are paid small amounts of money to produce content. It could be reviews. It could be propaganda. The government hires these people  companies hire them  all over the place. In North America  we call this Astroturfing  and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it. We see this especially with product reviews  book reviews  everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not. Now  looking at these three reviews  or these three types of deception  you might think  wow  the Internet is really making us a deceptive species  especially when you think about the Astroturfing  where we can see deception brought up to scale. But actually  what I've been finding is very different from that. Now  let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms  which I'm sure none of you have been in. I can assure you there's deception there. And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the    million out of the country.  Laughter  Let's forget about that guy  too. Let's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones. Those are the conversations that really matter. What does technology do to deception with those folks  Here's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do are called diary studies  in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days  and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium  and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media. And it really throws people for a loop because we think  well  there's no nonverbal cues  so why don't you lie more  The phone  in contrast  the most lies. Again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most  and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about. This tends to be very different from what people expect. What about r sum s  We did a study in which we had people apply for a job  and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper r sum   or on LinkedIn  which is a social networking site like Facebook  but for professionals    involves the same information as a r sum . And what we found  to many people's surprise  was that those LinkedIn r sum s were more honest on the things that mattered to employers  like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job. How about Facebook itself  You know  we always think that hey  there are these idealized versions  people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives. I've thought that many times. My friends  no way they can be that cool and have good of a life. Well  one study tested this by examining people's personalities. They had four good friends of a person judge their personality. Then they had strangers  many strangers  judge the person's personality just from Facebook  and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical  highly correlated  meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality. All right  well  what about online dating  I mean  that's a pretty deceptive space. I'm sure you all have  friends  that have used online dating.  Laughter  And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came  or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo. Well  we were really interested in it  and so what we did is we brought people  online daters  into the lab  and then we measured them. We got their height up against the wall  we put them on a scale  got their weight    ladies loved that    and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age. And what we found was very  very interesting. Here's an example of the men and the height. Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile. Along the y axis  the vertical axis  is how tall they actually were. That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it  they were telling exactly the truth. Now  as you see  most of the little dots are below the line. What it means is all the guys were lying about their height. In fact  they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch  what we say in the lab as  strong rounding up.   Laughter  You get to  '   and one tenth  and boom   '  . But what's really important here is  look at all those dots. They are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found was    percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions  but they always lied by a little bit. One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date  a coffee date  and you're completely different than what you said  game over. Right  So people lied frequently  but they lied subtly  not too much. They were constrained. Well  what explains all these studies  What explains the fact that despite our intuitions  mine included  a lot of online communication  technologically mediated communication  is more honest than face to face  That really is strange. How do we explain this  Well  to do that  one thing is we can look at the deception detection literature. It's a very old literature by now  it's coming up on    years. It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials  hundreds of studies  and there's some really compelling findings. The first is  we're really bad at detecting deception  really bad. Fifty four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not. That's really bad. Why is it so bad  Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose. If I were to ask you guys  what do you rely on when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they're lying  What cue do you pay attention to  Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul. And you're not alone. Around the world  almost every culture  one of the top cues is eyes. But the research over the last    years says there's actually no reliable cue to deception  which blew me away  and it's one of the hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer. The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not. Some situations  yes    high stakes  maybe their pupils dilate  their pitch goes up  their body movements change a little bit  but not all the time  not for everybody  it's not reliable. Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense  but one important finding is that we lie for a reason. We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else's gain. So there are some pathological liars  but they make up a tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason. Just because people can't see us doesn't mean we're going to necessarily lie. But I think there's actually something much more interesting and fundamental going on here. The next big thing for me  the next big idea  we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language. Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between        and         years ago. That's a long time ago. A lot of humans have lived since then. We've been talking  I guess  about fires and caves and saber toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about  but they were doing a lot of talking  and like I said  there's a lot of humans evolving speaking  about     billion people in fact. What's important though is that writing only emerged about       years ago. So what that means is that all the people before there was any writing  every word that they ever said  every utterance disappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone. So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record. In fact  even the next big change to writing was only     years ago now  with the printing press  which is very recent in our past  and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II  so even the people of the last two millennia  most of the words they ever said    poof     disappeared. Let's turn to now  the networked age. How many of you have recorded something today  Anybody do any writing today  Did anybody write a word  It looks like almost every single person here recorded something. In this room  right now  we've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre ancient history. That is crazy. We're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear  but we're in an environment where we're recording everything. In fact  I think in the very near future  it's not just what we write that will be recorded  everything we do will be recorded. What does that mean  What's the next big idea from that  Well  as a social scientist  this is the most amazing thing I have ever even dreamed of. Now  I can look at all those words that used to  for millennia  disappear. I can look at lies that before were said and then gone. You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before  Well  when they write a fake review  they have to post it somewhere  and it's left behind for us. So one thing that we did  and I'll give you an example of looking at the language  is we paid people to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake. The person never was at the James Hotel. The other review is real. The person stayed there. Now  your task now is to decide which review is fake  I'll give you a moment to read through them. But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point. Remember  I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand. All right  how many of you believe that A is the fake  All right. Very good. About half. And how many of you think that B is  All right. Slightly more for B. Excellent. Here's the answer. B is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group.  Laughter  You're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this  it's usually about a       split  which fits with the research     percent. Maybe people here in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out. Those cold  hard winters  I love it. All right  so why do I care about this  Well  what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception. Let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think about narrative. They make up a story  Who  And what happened  And that's what happened here. Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing. They also used the first person singular  I  way more than the people that actually stayed there. They were inserting themselves into the hotel review  kind of trying to convince you they were there. In contrast  the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there  their bodies actually entered the physical space  they talked a lot more about spatial information. They said how big the bathroom was  or they said  you know  here's how far shopping is from the hotel. Now  you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task. Our computer algorithm is very accurate  much more accurate than humans can be  and it's not going to be accurate all the time. This isn't a deception detection machine to tell if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging. We believe that every lie now  every type of lie    fake hotel reviews  fake shoe reviews  your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging    those are all different lies. They're going to have different patterns of language. But because everything's recorded now  we can look at all of those kinds of lies. Now  as I said  as a social scientist  this is wonderful. It's transformational. We're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression  about everything from love to attitudes  because everything is being recorded now  but what does it mean for the average citizen  What does it mean for us in our lives  Well  let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas  I believe  is that we're leaving these huge traces behind. My outbox for email is massive  and I never look at it. I write all the time  but I never look at my record  at my trace. And I think we're going to see a lot more of that  where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote  what we said  what we did. Now  if we bring it back to deception  there's a couple of take away things here. First  lying online can be very dangerous  right  Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine  but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to  and you're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms. So by all means  go ahead and do that  that's good. But when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives  I think we can go back to Diogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie  and more concerned about being true to the self  and I think this is really important. Now  when you are about to say or do something  we can think  do I want this to be part of my legacy  part of my personal record  Because in the digital age we live in now  in the networked age  we are all leaving a record. Thank you so much for your time  and good luck with your record.  Applause  On my desk in my office  I keep a small clay pot that I made in college. It's raku  which is a kind of pottery that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony. This one is more than     years old. Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay  and it was the imperfections that people cherished. Everyday pots like this cup take eight to    hours to fire. I just took this out of the kiln last week  and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down  but raku is really fast. You do it outside  and you take the kiln up to temperature. In    minutes  it goes to       degrees  and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside  you can see that faint sheen  you turn the kiln off  and you reach in with these long metal tongs  you grab the pot  and in Japan  this red hot pot would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea  and you can imagine what that steam would smell like. But here in the United States  we ramp up the drama a little bit  and we drop our pots into sawdust  which catches on fire  and you take a garbage pail  and you put it on top  and smoke starts pouring out. I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke. I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements. I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze  but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke  and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen  like this crackle pattern  because it's really stressful on these pots. They go from       degrees to room temperature in the space of just a minute. Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity. I find in so many things that tension between what I can control and what I have to let go happens all the time  whether I'm creating a new radio show or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons. When I sat down to write a book about creativity  I realized that the steps were reversed. I had to let go at the very beginning  and I had to immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers  and as I listened to these stories  I realized that creativity grows out of everyday experiences more often than you might think  including letting go. It was supposed to break  but that's okay.  Laughter   Laughs  That's part of the letting go  is sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't  because creativity also grows from the broken places. The best way to learn about anything is through stories  and so I want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace in order for our own creativity to flourish. The first embrace is something that we think   Oh  this is very easy   but it's actually getting harder  and that's paying attention to the world around us. So many artists speak about needing to be open  to embrace experience  and that's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus. The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar  and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town. Mira Nair  In this little town  there were like       temples. We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me  that led me on this path  that made me a filmmaker eventually  was traveling folk theater that would come through the town and I would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of  you know  passion  and hashish as well  and it was amazing. You know  the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana  the two holy books  the epics that everything comes out of in India  they say. After seeing that Jatra  the folk theater  I knew I wanted to get on  you know  and perform. Julie Burstein  Isn't that a wonderful story  You can see the sort of break in the everyday. There they are in the school fields  but it's good and evil  and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl with thousands of other people watching this performance  but she was ready. She was ready to open up to what it sparked in her  and it led her  as she said  down this path to become an award winning filmmaker. So being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embrace. Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult. The novelist Richard Ford speaks about a childhood challenge that continues to be something he wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic. Richard Ford  I was slow to learn to read  went all the way through school not really reading more than the minimum  and still to this day can't read silently much faster than I can read aloud  but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow I was going to have to do it  then I think I came very slowly into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language and of sentences that are not just the cognitive aspects of language  the syncopations  the sounds of words  what words look like  where paragraphs break  where lines break. I mean  I wasn't so badly dyslexic that I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it really slowly  and as I did  lingering on those sentences as I had to linger  I fell heir to language's other qualities  which I think has helped me write sentences. JB  It's so powerful. Richard Ford  who's won the Pulitzer Prize  says that dyslexia helped him write sentences. He had to embrace this challenge  and I use that word intentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia. He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music in language. Artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do  sometimes pushing into what they can't do  helps them focus on finding their own voice. The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how  as a young artist  he thought he was a painter  and he lived in Florence after graduate school. While he was there  he traveled to Madrid  where he went to the Prado to see this picture by the Spanish painter Diego Vel zquez. It's from       and it's called  Las Meninas   and it's the picture of a little princess and her ladies in waiting  and if you look over that little blonde princess's shoulder  you'll see a mirror  and reflected in it are her parents  the King and Queen of Spain  who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture. As he often did  Vel zquez put himself in this painting too. He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand and his palette in the other. Richard Serra  I was standing there looking at it  and I realized that Vel zquez was looking at me  and I thought   Oh. I'm the subject of the painting.  And I thought   I'm not going to be able to do that painting.  I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of randomness  and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped all my paintings in the Arno  and I thought  I'm going to just start playing around. JB  Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly  you might have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy who'd been dead for     years  and realized   I can't do that   and so Richard Serra went back to his studio in Florence  picked up all of his work up to that point  and threw it in a river. Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment  but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City  and he put together a list of verbs   to roll  to crease  to fold   more than a hundred of them  and as he said  he just started playing around. He did these things to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing to rubber  and when he got to the direction  to lift   he created this  which is in the Museum of Modern Art. Richard Serra had to let go of painting in order to embark on this playful exploration that led him to the work that he's known for today  huge curves of steel that require our time and motion to experience. In sculpture  Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting. He makes us the subject of his art. So experience and challenge and limitations are all things we need to embrace for creativity to flourish. There's a fourth embrace  and it's the hardest. It's the embrace of loss  the oldest and most constant of human experiences. In order to create  we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for  looking squarely at rejection  at heartbreak  at war  at death. That's a tough space to stand in. The educator Parker Palmer calls it  the tragic gap   tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable  and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say   You can hold that tension like a violin string and make something beautiful.  That tension resonates in the work of the photographer Joel Meyerowitz  who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography  for capturing a moment on the street  and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes    of Tuscany  of Cape Cod  of light. Joel is a New Yorker  and his studio for many years was in Chelsea  with a straight view downtown to the World Trade Center  and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light. You know where this story goes. On       Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town  but he raced back to the city  and raced down to the site of the destruction. Joel Meyerowitz  And like all the other passersby  I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers and Greenwich  and all I could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble  and I raised my camera to take a peek  just to see if there was something to see  and some cop  a lady cop  hit me on my shoulder  and said   Hey  no pictures   And it was such a blow that it woke me up  in the way that it was meant to be  I guess. And when I asked her why no pictures  she said   It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed.  And I asked her   What would happen if I was a member of the press   And she told me   Oh  look back there   and back a block was the press corps tied up in a little penned in area  and I said   Well  when do they go in   and she said   Probably never.  And as I walked away from that  I had this crystallization  probably from the blow  because it was an insult in a way. I thought   Oh  if there's no pictures  then there'll be no record. We need a record.  And I thought   I'm gonna make that record. I'll find a way to get in  because I don't want to see this history disappear.  JB  He did. He pulled in every favor he could  and got a pass into the World Trade Center site  where he photographed for nine months almost every day. Looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night. My office was just a few blocks away. But some of these photographs are beautiful  and we wondered  was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz to make such beauty out of such devastation  JM  Well  you know  ugly  I mean  powerful and tragic and horrific and everything  but it was also as  in nature  an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue  and like many other ruins   you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace   and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather. I mean  there were afternoons I was down there  and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air and you're standing in the rubble  and I found myself recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature  as time  is erasing this wound. Time is unstoppable  and it transforms the event. It gets further and further away from the day  and light and seasons temper it in some way  and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist. The reality is  there's the Woolworth Building in a veil of smoke from the site  but it's now like a scrim across a theater  and it's turning pink  you know  and down below there are hoses spraying  and the lights have come on for the evening  and the water is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on  and I'm thinking   My God  who could dream this up   But the fact is  I'm there  it looks like that  you have to take a picture. JB  You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency  of the need to get to work  is so powerful in Joel's story. When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently  I told him how much I admired his passionate obstinacy  his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work  and he laughed  and he said   I'm stubborn  but I think what's more important is my passionate optimism.  The first time I told these stories  a man in the audience raised his hand and said   All these artists talk about their work  not their art  which has got me thinking about my work and where the creativity is there  and I'm not an artist.  He's right. We all wrestle with experience and challenge  limits and loss. Creativity is essential to all of us  whether we're scientists or teachers  parents or entrepreneurs. I want to leave you with another image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one is at the Freer Gallery in Washington  D.C. It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it. But as you can also see  this one did break at some point in its hundred years. But the person who put it back together  instead of hiding the cracks  decided to emphasize them  using gold lacquer to repair it. This bowl is more beautiful now  having been broken  than it was when it was first made  and we can look at those cracks  because they tell the story that we all live  of the cycle of creation and destruction  of control and letting go  of picking up the pieces and making something new. Thank you.  Applause  So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife. It makes me to stand here  the fame  the money I got out of it. So what I did  I'd gone back to my early marriage days. What you did in the early marriage days  you tried to impress your wife. I did the same. On that occasion  I found my wife carrying something like this. I saw.  What is that   I asked. My wife replied   None of your business.  Then  being her husband  I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth. I don't even use that cloth to clean my two wheeler. Then I understood this    adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days. Then I immediately asked her  why are you  using  that unhygienic method  She replied  I also know about  sanitary pads   but myself and my sisters  if they start using that  we have to cut our family milk budget. Then I was shocked. What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget  And it's called affordability. I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads. I went to a local shop  I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet. That fellow looks left and right  and spreads a newspaper  rolls it into the newspaper  gives it to me like a banned item  something like that. I don't know why. I did not ask for a condom. Then I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it  The very first time  at the age of     that day I am touching the sanitary pad  first ever. I must know  How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad  They are not going to touch that  because it's not your matter. Then I thought to myself  white substance  made of cotton    oh my God  that guy is just using a penny value of raw material    inside they are selling for pounds  dollars. Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife  That's how all this started  but after making a sanitary pad  where can I check it  It's not like I can just check it in the lab. I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India  Even in Bangalore you won't get  one   in India. So only problem  the only available victim is my wife. Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti    my wife's name is Shanti.  Close your eyes. Whatever I give  it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring  even a chocolate  I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it. Close your eyes.  Because I tried to make it intimate. Because it's an arranged marriage  not a love marriage. So one day she said  openly  I'm not going to support this research. Then other victims  they got into my sisters. But even sisters  wives  they're not ready to support in the research. That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India. They are having a lot of women volunteers around them. Why I am not getting  any   You know  without them even calling  they'll get a lot of women volunteers. Then I used  tried to use the medical college girls. They also refused. Finally  I decide  use sanitary pad myself. Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon. Armstrong. Then Tenzing  and  Hillary  in Everest  like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe. I wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle  I tied it up here  there is a tube going into my panties  while I'm walking  while I'm cycling  I made a press  doses of blood will go there. That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget    the messy days  the lousy days  that wetness. My God  it's unbelievable. But here the problem is  one company is making napkin out of cotton. It is working well. But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working. That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research. You need first funds. Not only financial crises  but because of the sanitary pad research  I come through all sorts of problems  including a divorce notice from my wife. Why is this  I used medical college girls. She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls. Finally  I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood  but even after that  you need a multimillion dollar plant like this to process that material. Again  a stop up. Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools  a simple machine tool like this. In this machine  any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant  anyone can make a world class napkin at your dining hall. That is my invention. So after that  what I did  usually if anyone got a patent or an invention  immediately you want to make  convert into this. I never did this. I dropped it just like this  because you do this  if anyone runs after money  their life will not  have  any beauty. It is boredom. A lot of people making a lot of money  billion  billions of dollars accumulating. Why are they coming for  finally  for philanthropy  Why the need for accumulating money  then doing philanthropy  What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one  That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India  for rural women  because in India   you'll be  surprised  only two percent of women are using sanitary pads. The rest  they're using a rag cloth  a leaf  husk   saw  dust  everything except sanitary pads. It is the same in the   st century. That's why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India. So far      installations happened in    states in six other countries. Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational  transnational giants    makes all MBA students a question mark. A school dropout from Coimbatore  how he is able to sustaining  That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs. Play video one. She replied immediately   I know about napkins  but if I start using napkins  then we have to cut our family milk budget.  Why not make myself a low cost napkin  So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups. That is my idea. AM  And previously  you need a multimillion investment for machine and all. Now  any rural woman can. They are performing puja. You just think  competing giants  even from Harvard  Oxford  is difficult. I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals. I'm sustaining on seventh year. Already     installations. What is my mission  I'm going to make India  into  a     percent sanitary napkin using country in my lifetime. In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create. That's why I'm not running after this bloody money. I'm doing something serious. If you chase a girl  the girl won't like you. Do your job simply  the girl will chase you. Like that  I never chased Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi is chasing me  I am keeping in the back pocket. Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man. That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad. I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy. I don't want to make this as a corporate entity. I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe. That's why I put all the details on public domain like an open software. Now     countries are accessing it. Okay  So I classify the people into three  uneducated  little educated  surplus educated. Little educated  done this. Surplus educated  what are you going to do for the society  Thank you very much. Bye  I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day  and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email  in Facebook  in texting or cell phones in general. And so while other kids were BBM ing their parents  I was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone  which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital  but I was just looking for some sort of scribble  some unkempt cursive from my mother. And so when I moved to New York City after college and got completely sucker punched in the face by depression  I did the only thing I could think of at the time. I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers  and tucked them all throughout the city  dozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere  in cafes and in libraries  at the U.N.  everywhere. I blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary  and I posed a kind of crazy promise to the Internet  that if you asked me for a hand written letter  I would write you one  no questions asked. Overnight  my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak    a single mother in Sacramento  a girl being bullied in rural Kansas  all asking me  a    year old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order  to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox. Well  today I fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox  fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most  but most of all  fueled by crates of mail like this one  my trusty mail crate  filled with the scriptings of ordinary people  strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee  but because they have found one another by way of letter writing. But  you know  the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper. They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters. They're the ones from my generation  the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless  and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen. We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook  and we speak swiftly in     characters or less. But what if it's not about efficiency this time  I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate  which is a conversation starter  let me tell you. If you ever need one  just carry one of these.  Laughter  And a man just stared at me  and he was like   Well  why don't you use the Internet   And I thought   Well  sir  I am not a strategist  nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller.  And so I could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan  and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation  and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say   Come back to me. Find me when you can.  Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in Dubuque  Iowa  only to find her efforts ripple effected the next day when she walks out onto the quad and finds love letters hanging from the trees  tucked in the bushes and the benches. Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life  uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family. Well  tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow  scripted by strangers who were there for him when. These are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency  because she is an art form now  all the parts of her  the signing  the scripting  the mailing  the doodles in the margins. The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down  pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through  with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once  that is an art form that does not fall down to the Goliath of  get faster   no matter how many social networks we might join. We still clutch close these letters to our chest  to the words that speak louder than loud  when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say  the words that we have needed to write  to sisters and brothers and even to strangers  for far too long. Thank you.  Applause  Today  I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics. I'm  among several other things  an electrical engineer  and that means that I spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology  and more specifically designing and building electronics. And what I've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways. So it's a really slow process  it's really expensive  and the outcome of that process  namely electronic circuit boards  are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways. So they're really small  generally  they're square and flat and hard  and frankly  most of them just aren't very attractive  and so my team and I have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics. And so what if you could design and build electronics like this  So what if you could do it extremely quickly  extremely inexpensively  and maybe more interestingly  really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally  Wouldn't that be so cool  and that wouldn't that open up all sorts of new possibilities  I'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along these lines  and we'll start with this one. A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC. Sticker templates. Speed x  . Making a switch. Music  DJ Shadow. Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller. Sketching an interface. Pretty cool  huh  We think so. So now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things  we started to realize that  essentially  anything that we can do with paper  anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics. So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility. And I'll kind of let it speak for itself. So the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this  and so the way that we're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools  and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways. And so sometime soon  you'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way. So thank you very much.  Applause  Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney. I got to the airport  to the hotel  checked in  and  sitting there in the lobby  was a brochure for the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it  and I came across a show called  Minto  Live.  The description read   The suburban streets of Minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of Minto.  What was this place called Minto  Sydney  as I would learn  is a city of suburbs  and Minto lies southwest  about an hour away. I have to say  it wasn't exactly what I had in mind for my first day down under. I mean  I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach  but Minto  But still  I'm a producer  and the lure of a site specific theater project was more than I could resist.  Laughter  So  off I went into Friday afternoon traffic  and I'll never forget what I saw when I got there. For the performance  the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house  and the residents  who were the performers  they came out of their houses  and they performed these autobiographical dances on their lawns  on their driveways.  Laughter  The show is a collaboration with a U.K. based performance company called Lone Twin. Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked with the residents  and they had created these dances. This Australian Indian girl  she came out and started to dance on her front lawn  and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about  and he soon joined her. And he was followed by her little sister. And soon they were all dancing this joyous  exuberant dance right there on their lawn.  Laughter  And as I walked through the neighborhood  I was amazed and I was moved by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this event.  Minto  Live  brought Sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists  and really celebrated the diversity of Sydney on its own terms. The Sydney Festival which produced  Minto  Live  I think represents a new kind of   st century arts festival. These festivals are radically open. They can transform cities and communities. To understand this  I think it kind of makes sense to look where we've come from. Modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of World War II. Civic leaders created these annual events to celebrate culture as the highest expression of the human spirit. In       the Edinburgh Festival was born and Avignon was born and hundreds of others would follow in their wake. The work they did was very  very high art  and stars came along like Laurie Anderson and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage who made work for this circuit  and you had these seminal shows like  The Mahabharata  and the monumental  Einstein on the Beach.  But as the decades passed  these festivals  they really became the establishment  and as the culture and capital accelerated  the Internet brought us all together  high and low kind of disappeared  a new kind of festival emerged. The old festivals  they continued to thrive  but from Brighton to Rio to Perth  something new was emerging  and these festivals were really different. They're open  these festivals  because  like in Minto  they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential. They're open because they ask the audience to be a player  a protagonist  a partner  rather than a passive spectator  and they're open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings  and so much of the work they do is site specific or outdoor work. So  the new festival  it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance. Companies like De La Guarda  which I produce  and Punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action  but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll takes this all to a whole new level. In a series of shows that includes      Percent Vancouver        Percent Berlin   Rimini Protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society. Rimini Protokoll chooses     people that represent that city at that moment in terms of race and gender and class  through a careful process that begins three months before  and then those     people share stories about themselves and their lives  and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment. LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues. They understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere. You can do a show in a schoolroom  in an airport     Laughter    in a department store window. Artists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew  Artists can take us to a far flung part of the city that we haven't explored  or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into. An artist  I think  can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives. Back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal at rush hour. We  the audience  were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal. The actors were right there in front of us  right there among the commuters  and we could hear them  but we might not have otherwise seen them. So Back to Back takes site specific theater and uses it to gently remind us about who and what we choose to edit out of our daily lives. So  the dialogue with the local and the global  the audience as participant and player and protagonist  the innovative use of site  all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe. Royal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city and they live there for a few days. For  The Sultan's Elephant   Royal de Luxe came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend  a time traveling elephant. For a few days  they transformed a massive city into a community where endless possibility reigned. The Guardian wrote   If art is about transformation  then there can be no more transformative experience. What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people.  We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities  but I'm much  more  interested in many more things  like how a festival helps a city to express itself  how it lets it come into its own. Festivals promote diversity  they bring neighbors into dialogue  they increase creativity  they offer opportunities for civic pride  they improve our general psychological well being. In short  they make cities better places to live. Case in point  When  The Sultan's Elephant  came to London just nine months after      a Londoner wrote   For the first time since the London bombings  my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice. She had gathered with others to watch 'The Sultan's Elephant ' and  you know  it just made all the difference.  Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world  a map of the city and a map of ourselves  but there is no one fixed festival model. I think what's so brilliant about the festivals  the new festivals  is that they are really fully capturing the complexity and the excitement of the way we all live today. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm a brain scientist  and as a brain scientist  I'm actually interested in how the brain learns  and I'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter  better and faster. This is in this context I'm going to tell you about video games. When we say video games  most of you think about children. It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games. But let's be frank. When the kids are in bed  who is in front of the PlayStation  Most of you. The average age of a gamer is    years old  not eight years old  and in fact  if we look at the projected demographics of video game play  the video game players of tomorrow are older adults.  Laughter  So video  gaming  is pervasive throughout our society. It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact on our everyday life. Consider these statistics released by Activision. After one month of release of the game  Call Of Duty  Black Ops   it had been played for        years worldwide  right  Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra  So what we are asking in the lab is  how can we leverage that power  Now I want to step back a bit. I know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games. after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you  right  And I'm almost sure most of you have thought   Oh  come on  can't you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies   I'd like you to put this kind of knee jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right  Most parents would find that great. Well  I'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health. It's not  and binging is never good. But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses  actually the very game I showed you at the beginning  those action packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior. There's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you  right  You're all bombarded with that. I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab. What we do in the lab is actually measure directly  in a quantitative fashion  what is the impact of video games on the brain. And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work. One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse. That's a statement about vision. There may be vision scientists among you. We actually know how to test that statement. We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is. Well  guess what  People that don't play a lot of action games  that don't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens  have normal  or what we call corrective to normal vision. That's okay. The issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week     hours per week     hours per week. By that statement  their vision should be really bad  right  Guess what  Their vision is really  really good. It's better than those that don't play. And it's better in two different ways. The first way is that they're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter  and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses  you can actually do it with just your eyesight. The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray. Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident  or getting into an accident. So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision  and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better. Clearly  when it comes to action video games  screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse. Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around  Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability. Okay  we know how to measure attention in the lab. I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so. I'm going to ask you to participate  so you're going to have to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink. Right  So this is the first example.   Chair   Orange  good.   Table   Green.   Board   Audience  Red.Daphne Bavelier  Red.   Horse   DB  Yellow. Audience  Yellow.   Yellow   DB  Red. Audience  Yellow.   Blue   DB  Yellow. Okay  you get my point  right   Laughter  You're getting better  but it's hard. Why is it hard  Because I introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color. How good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict  so the young guys here at the top of their game probably  like  did a little better than some of us that are older. What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games  they actually resolve the conflict faster. So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead to attention problems. Actually  those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention  and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world. This is something we use all the time. When you're driving  you're tracking  keeping track of the cars around you. You're also keeping track of the pedestrian  the running dog  and that's how you can actually be safe driving  right  In the lab  we get people to come to the lab  sit in front of a computer screen  and we give them little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again. You're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces. These are children in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess. But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat. Everybody begins to move around  and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes. You can track  you can track  and then when it stops  and there is a question mark  and I ask you  did this kid have a coat or not  Was it yellow initially or blue  I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain.  Laughter  I'm now going to ask you to do the task  but now with a little more challenging task. There are going to be three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes. Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated and expand  pull your attention. That's the only way you can actually do it. If you move your eyes  you're doomed. Yellow or blue  Audience  Yellow.DB  Good. So your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention. That's what we just did. Your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention  which is what is shown in this video here. That's for you guys  action video game players. A bit more challenging  right   Laughter  Yellow or blue  Blue. We have some people that are serious out there. Yeah.  Laughter  Good. So in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people's behavior  we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain  and we do find many changes  but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention. The other one is the frontal lobe  which controls how we sustain attention  and another one is the anterior cingulate  which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict. Now  when we do brain imaging  we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games. This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain. You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty of multitasking when you're driving and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea. Why  Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone  you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you  and so you're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident. Now  we can measure that kind of skills in the lab. We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure  to millisecond accuracy  how good they are at switching from one task to another. When we do that  we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really  really good. They switch really fast  very swiftly. They pay a very small cost. Now I'd like you to remember that result  and put it in the context of another group of technology users  a group which is actually much revered by society  which are people that engage in multimedia tasking. What is multimedia tasking  It's the fact that most of us  most of our children  are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they're doing search on the web at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends. That's a multimedia tasker. There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking. When we measure them in the lab  they're really bad. Right  So these kinds of results really makes two main points. The first one is that not all media are created equal. You can't compare the effect of multimedia tasking and the effect of playing action games. They have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition  perception and attention. Even within video games  I'm telling you right now about these action packed video games. Different video games have a different effect on your brains. So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game. The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight. I showed that to you already  like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time  those action gamers have a lot of very good vision  etc. Here  what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia tasking are convinced they aced the test. So you show them their data  you show them they are bad and they're like   Not possible.  You know  they have this sort of gut feeling that  really  they are doing really  really good. That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain. Now in a sense  when we think about the effect of video games on the brain  it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health. There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some very poor uses of video games. But when consumed in reasonable doses  and at the right age  wine can be very good for health. There are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy. So it's the same way  like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity  learning  attention  vision  etc.  and so we need and we're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games  either for education or for rehabilitation of patients. Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients  we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform. I'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game  I can actually change your vision for the better  whether you want to play that action game or not  right  That's the point of rehabilitation or education. Most of the kids don't go to school saying   Great  two hours of math   So that's really the crux of the research  and to do that  we need to go one more step. And one more step is to do training studies. So let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation. Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you  and again you're going to do the task  to look at this shape. Study it  it's a target shape  and I'm going to present to you four different shapes. One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one  the first one  second one  third one or fourth one  Okay  I'll help you. Fourth one. One more. Get those brains working. Come on. That's our target shape. Third. Good  This is hard  right  Like  the reason that I asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing  right  It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games. Well  what we do in these training studies is  people come to the lab  they do tasks like this one  we then force them to play    hours of action games. They don't play    hours of action games in a row. They do distributed practice  so little shots of    minutes several days over a period of two weeks. Then  once they are done with the training  they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague in Toronto. What they showed is that  initially  you know  subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age. After two weeks of training on action video games  they actually perform better  and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training. That's really  really important. Why  Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects that are going to be long lasting. Now  at this point  a number of you are probably wondering well  what are you waiting for  to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy  or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia  for example  Well  we're working on it  but here is a challenge. There are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects  and that's what I'm going to call the broccoli side of the equation. There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist. That's the chocolate side of the equation. The issue is we need to put the two together  and it's a little bit like with food. Who really wants to eat chocolate covered broccoli  None of you.  Laughter  And you probably have had that feeling  right  picking up an education game and sort of feeling  hmm  you know  it's not really fun  it's not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate  a brand of chocolate that is irresistible  that you really want to play  but that has all the ingredients  the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it  but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together  people that work in the entertainment software industry  and publishers  so these are not people that usually meet every day  but it's actually doable  and we are on the right track. I'd like to leave you with that thought  and thank you for your attention.  Applause  Living with a physical disability isn't easy anywhere in the world  but if you live in a country like the United States  there's certain appurtenances available to you that do make life easier. So if you're in a building  you can take an elevator. If you're crossing the street  you have sidewalk cutouts. And if you have to travel some distance farther than you can do under your own power  there's accessible vehicles  and if you can't afford one of those  there's accessible public transportation. But in the developing world  things are quite different. There's    million people who need a wheelchair but don't have one  and the majority of these people live in rural areas  where the only connections to community  to employment  to education  are by traveling long distances on rough terrain often under their own power. And the devices usually available to these people are not made for that context  break down quickly  and are hard to repair. I started looking at wheelchairs in developing countries in       when I spent the summer assessing the state of technology in Tanzania  and I talked to wheelchair users  wheelchair manufacturers  disability groups  and what stood out to me is that there wasn't a device available that was designed for rural areas  that could go fast and efficiently on many types of terrain. So being a mechanical engineer  being at MIT and having lots of resources available to me  I thought I'd try to do something about it. Now when you're talking about trying to travel long distances on rough terrain  I immediately thought of a mountain bike  and a mountain bike's good at doing this because it has a gear train  and you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill or go through mud or sand and you get a lot of torque but a low speed. And if you want to go faster  say on pavement  you can shift to a high gear  and you get less torque  but higher speeds. So the logical evolution here is to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components  which many people have done. But these are two products available in the U.S. that would be difficult to transfer into developing countries because they're much  much too expensive. And the context I'm talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than     dollars. And this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job  get to school  and do it on many  many different types of terrain. But when you get home or want to go indoors at your work  it's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside. And furthermore  if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas  it has to be repairable using the local tools  materials and knowledge in those contexts. So the real crux of the problem here is  how do you make a system that's a simple device but gives you a large mechanical advantage  How do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn't have the mountain bike cost and complexity  So as is the case with simple solutions  oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face  and for us it was levers. We use levers all the time  in tools  doorknobs  bicycle parts. And that moment of inspiration  that key invention moment  was when I was sitting in front of my design notebook and I started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever  and if they grab near the end of the lever  they can get an effectively long lever and produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth  and effectively get a low gear. And as they slide their hand down the lever  they can push with a smaller effective lever length  but push through a bigger angle every stroke  which makes a faster rotational speed  and gives you an effective high gear. So what's exciting about this system is that it's really  really mechanically simple  and you could make it using technology that's been around for hundreds of years. So seeing this in practice  this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that  after a few years of development  we're now going into production with  and this is a full time wheelchair user    he's paralyzed    in Guatemala  and you see he's able to traverse pretty rough terrain. Again  the key innovation of this technology is that when he wants to go fast  he just grabs the levers near the pivots and goes through a big angle every stroke  and as the going gets tougher  he just slides his hands up the levers  creates more torque  and kind of bench presses his way out of trouble through the rough terrain. Now the big  important point here is that the person is the complex machine in this system. It's the person that's sliding his hands up and down the levers  so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world. Because those bicycle parts are so ubiquitously available  they're super cheap. They're made by the gazillions in China and India  and we can source them anywhere in the world  build the chair anywhere  and most importantly repair it  even out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic who has local tools  knowledge and parts available. Now  when you want to use the LFC indoors  all you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain  stow them in the frame  and it converts into a normal wheelchair that you can use just like any other normal wheelchair  and we sized it like a normal wheelchair  so it's narrow enough to fit through a standard doorway  it's low enough to fit under a table  and it's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom and this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet  and be able to transfer off just like he could in a normal wheelchair. Now  there's three important points that I want to stress that I think really hit home in this project. The first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries. So I'm an academic at MIT  and I'm a mechanical engineer  so I can do things like look at the type of terrain you want to travel on  and figure out how much resistance it should impose  look at the parts we have available and mix and match them to figure out what sort of gear trains we can use  and then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body to analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair as you put your arms up and down the levers. So as a wet behind the ears student  excited  our team made a prototype  brought that prototype to Tanzania  Kenya and Vietnam in       and found it was terrible because we didn't get enough input from users. So because we tested it with wheelchair users  with wheelchair manufacturers  we got that feedback from them  not just articulating their problems  but articulating their solutions  and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design  which we brought back to East Africa in '   that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain  but it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big  it was heavy  it was hard to move around  so again with that user feedback  we went back to the drawing board  came up with a better design     pounds lighter  as narrow as a regular wheelchair  tested that in a field trial in Guatemala  and that advanced the product to the point where we have now that it's going into production. Now also being engineering scientists  we were able to quantify the performance benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair  so here are some shots of our trial in Guatemala where we tested the LFC on village terrain  and tested people's biomechanical outputs  their oxygen consumption  how fast they go  how much power they're putting out  both in their regular wheelchairs and using the LFC  and we found that the LFC is about    percent faster going on these terrains than a normal wheelchair. It's also about    percent more efficient than a regular wheelchair  and because of the mechanical advantage you get from the levers  you can produce    percent higher torque and really muscle your way through the really  really rough terrain. Now the second lesson that we learned in this is that the constraints on this design really push the innovation  because we had to hit such a low price point  because we had to make a device that could travel on many  many types of terrain but still be usable indoors  and be simple enough to repair  we ended up with a fundamentally new product  a new product that is an innovation in a space that really hasn't changed in a hundred years. And these are all merits that are not just good in the developing world. Why not in countries like the U.S. too  So we teamed up with Continuum  a local product design firm here in Boston to make the high end version  the developed world version  that we'll probably sell primarily in the U.S. and Europe  but to higher income buyers. And the final point I want to make is that I think this project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea through innovation  validation  commercialization and dissemination  and that cycle has to start and end with end users. These are the people that define the requirements of the technology  and these are the people that have to give the thumbs up at the end  and say   Yeah  it actually works. It meets our needs.  So people like me in the academic space  we can do things like innovate and analyze and test  create data and make bench level prototypes  but how do you get that bench level prototype to commercialization  So we need gap fillers like Continuum that can work on commercializing  and we started a whole NGO to bring our chair to market    Global Research Innovation Technology    and then we also teamed up with a big manufacturer in India  Pinnacle Industries  that's tooled up now to make     chairs a month and will make the first batch of     next month  which will be delivered in India. And then finally  to get this out to the people in scale  we teamed up with the largest disability organization in the world  Jaipur Foot. Now what's powerful about this model is when you bring together all these stakeholders that represent each link in the chain from inception of an idea all the way to implementation in the field  that's where the magic happens. That's where you can take a guy like me  an academic  but analyze and test and create a new technology and quantitatively determine how much better the performance is. You can connect with stakeholders like the manufacturers and talk with them face to face and leverage their local knowledge of manufacturing practices and their clients and combine that knowledge with our engineering knowledge to create something greater than either of us could have done alone. And then you can also engage the end user in the design process  and not just ask him what he needs  but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved. And this picture was taken in India in our last field trial  where we had a    percent adoption rate where people switched to using our Leveraged Freedom Chair over their normal wheelchair  and this picture specifically is of Ashok  and Ashok had a spinal injury when he fell out of a tree  and he had been working at a tailor  but once he was injured he wasn't able to transport himself from his house over a kilometer to his shop in his normal wheelchair. The road was too rough. But the day after he got an LFC  he hopped in it  rode that kilometer  opened up his shop and soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms and started making money  started providing for his family again. Ashok  You also encouraged me to work. I rested for a day at home. The next day I went to my shop. Now everything is back to normal. Amos Winter  And thank you very much for having me today. When I graduated UCLA  I moved to northern California  and I lived in a little town called Elk on the Mendocino coast  and I didn't have a phone or TV  but I had U.S. mail  and life was good back then  if you could remember it. I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie  and I'd ship my film to San Francisco  and lo and behold  two days later  it would end up on my front door  which was way better than having to fight the traffic of Hollywood.  Music  I didn't have much money  but I had time and a sense of wonder.  Music  So I started shooting time lapse photography. It would take me a month to shoot a four minute roll of film  because that's all I could afford. I've been shooting time lapse flowers continuously  non stop     hours a day  seven days a week  for over    years  and to see them move is a dance I'll never get tired of. Their beauty immerses us with color  taste  touch. It also provides a third of the food we eat. Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival  because we protect what we fall in love with. It opens our hearts  and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it. When we see ourselves in nature  it also connects us to every one of us  because it's clear that it's all connected in one. When people see my images  a lot of times they'll say   Oh my God.  Have you ever wondered what that meant  The  oh  means it caught your attention  makes you present  makes you mindful. The  my  means it connects with something deep inside your soul. It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard. And  God   God is that personal journey we all want to be on  to be inspired  to feel like we're connected to a universe that celebrates life. Did you know that    percent of the information we receive comes through our eyes  And if you compare light energy to musical scales  it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see  which is right in the middle  And aren't we grateful for our brains that can  you know  take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world  And aren't we grateful that we have hearts that can feel these vibrations in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature  Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude. So I have a gift I want to share with you today  a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed  and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of that world. Child  When I watch TV  it's just some shows that you just    that are pretend  and when you explore  you get more imagination than you already had  and when you get more imagination  it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things  like the path  if it's a path  it could lead you to a beach  or something  and it could be beautiful. Elderly Man  You think this is just another day in your life  It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you today. It's given to you. It's a gift. It's the only gift that you have right now  and the only appropriate response is gratefulness. If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift that this unique day is  if you learn to respond as if it were the first day in your life and the very last day  then you will have spent this day very well. Begin by opening your eyes and be surprised that you have eyes you can open  that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us for pure enjoyment. Look at the sky. We so rarely look at the sky. We so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment  with clouds coming and going. We just think of the weather  and even with the weather  we don't think of all the many nuances of weather. We just think of good weather and bad weather. This day  right now  has unique weather  maybe a kind that will never exactly in that form come again. That formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same as it is right now. Open your eyes. Look at that. Look at the faces of people whom you meet. Each one has an incredible story behind their face  a story that you could never fully fathom  not only their own story  but the story of their ancestors. We all go back so far  and in this present moment  on this day  all the people you meet  all that life from generations and from so many places all over the world flows together and meets you here like a life giving water  if you only open your heart and drink. Open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization gives to us. You flip a switch and there is electric light. You turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water  and drinkable water. It's a gift that millions and millions in the world will never experience. So these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts to which we can open your heart. And so I wish you that you will open your heart to all these blessings  and let them flow through you  that everyone whom you will meet on this day will be blessed by you  just by your eyes  by your smile  by your touch  just by your presence. Let the gratefulness overflow into blessing all around you  and then it will really be a good day.  Music  Louie Schwartzberg  Thank you. Thank you very much.  Applause  There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives. We don't bump into every neighbor  so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on  though we do share the same public spaces. So over the past few years  I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space  using simple tools like stickers  stencils and chalk. And these projects came from questions I had  like  How much are my neighbors paying for their apartments  How can we lend and borrow more things  without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time  How can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings  and gain a better understanding of our landscape  How can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts  so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today  Now  I live in New Orleans  and I am in love with New Orleans. My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees  shading lovers  drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years  and I trust a city that always makes way for music. I feel like every time someone sneezes  New Orleans has a parade. The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world  but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America. I live near this house  and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood  and I also thought about something that changed my life forever. In       I lost someone I loved very much. Her name was Joan  and she was a mother to me. And her death was sudden and unexpected. And I thought about death a lot. And ... this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had. And ... brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now. But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life. I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day to day  and forget what really matters to you. So with help from old and new friends  I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard  and stenciled it with a fill in the blank sentence   Before I die  I want to ...  So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk  reflect on their life  and share their personal aspirations in public space. I didn't know what to expect from this experiment  but by the next day  the wall was entirely filled out  and it kept growing. And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall.  Before I die  I want to be tried for piracy.   Before I die  I want to straddle the International Dateline.   Before I die  I want to sing for millions.   Before I die  I want to plant a tree.   Before I die  I want to live off the grid.   Before I die  I want to hold her one more time.   Before I die  I want to be someone's cavalry.   Before I die  I want to be completely myself.  So this neglected space became a constructive one  and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud  tear up  and they consoled me during my own tough times. It's about knowing you're not alone  it's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways  it's about making space for reflection and contemplation  and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change. I made this last year  and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community. So  my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit  and now walls have been made in countries around the world  including Kazakhstan  South Africa  Australia  Argentina  and beyond. Together  we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we're given the opportunity to have a voice  and share more with one another. Two of the most valuable things we have are time  and our relationships with other people. In our age of increasing distractions  it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective  and remember that life is brief and tender. Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about  or even think about  but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. Thinking about death clarifies your life. Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us  as individuals and as a community  and with more ways to share our hopes  fears and stories  the people around us can not only help us make better places  they can help us lead better lives. Thank you. Thank you. Everything I do  and everything I do professionally    my life    has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa. From      to         I look young  but I'm not    Laughter     I worked in Zambia  Kenya  Ivory Coast  Algeria  Somalia  in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. I worked for an Italian NGO  and every single project that we set up in Africa failed. And I was distraught. I thought  age     that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa. Instead  everything we touched we killed. Our first project  the one that has inspired my first book   Ripples from the Zambezi   was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food. So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River  and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ... And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that  so we paid them to come and work  and sometimes they would show up.  Laughter  And we were amazed that the local people  in such a fertile valley  would not have any agriculture. But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything  we simply said   Thank God we're here.   Laughter   Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation.  And of course  everything in Africa grew beautifully. We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy  a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia  to this size. And we could not believe  and we were telling the Zambians   Look how easy agriculture is.  When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red  overnight  some     hippos came out from the river and they ate everything.  Laughter  And we said to the Zambians   My God  the hippos   And the Zambians said   Yes  that's why we have no agriculture here.   Laughter   Why didn't you tell us   You never asked.  I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa  but then I saw what the Americans were doing  what the English were doing  what the French were doing  and after seeing what they were doing  I became quite proud of our project in Zambia. Because  you see  at least we fed the hippos. You should see the rubbish    Applause     You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people. You want to read the book  read  Dead Aid   by Dambisa Moyo  Zambian woman economist. The book was published in     . We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last    years. I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done. Just go and read her book. Read it from an African woman  the damage that we have done. We Western people are imperialist  colonialist missionaries  and there are only two ways we deal with people  We either patronize them  or we are paternalistic. The two words come from the Latin root  pater   which means  father.  But they mean two different things. Paternalistic  I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children.  I love you so much.  Patronizing  I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants. That's why the white people in Africa are called  bwana   boss. I was given a slap in the face reading a book   Small is Beautiful   written by Schumacher  who said  above all in economic development  if people do not wish to be helped  leave them alone. This should be the first principle of aid. The first principle of aid is respect. This morning  the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor  and said   Can we    can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial   I decided when I was    years old to only respond to people  and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation  where you never initiate anything  you never motivate anybody  but you become a servant of the local passion  the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person. So what you do    you shut up. You never arrive in a community with any ideas  and you sit with the local people. We don't work from offices. We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub. We have zero infrastructure. And what we do  we become friends  and we find out what that person wants to do. The most important thing is passion. You can give somebody an idea. If that person doesn't want to do it  what are you going to do  The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing. The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing. And then we help them to go and find the knowledge  because nobody in the world can succeed alone. The person with the idea may not have the knowledge  but the knowledge is available. So years and years ago  I had this idea  Why don't we  for once  instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do  why don't  for once  listen to them  But not in community meetings. Let me tell you a secret. There is a problem with community meetings. Entrepreneurs never come  and they never tell you  in a public meeting  what they want to do with their own money  what opportunity they have identified. So planning has this blind spot. The smartest people in your community you don't even know  because they don't come to your public meetings. What we do  we work one on one  and to work one on one  you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist. You have to create a new profession. The profession is the family doctor of enterprise  the family doctor of business  who sits with you in your house  at your kitchen table  at the cafe  and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living. I started this as a tryout in Esperance  in Western Australia. I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time  trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do. And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets  and in three days I had my first client  and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage  was a Maori guy  and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth  to get organized  and then the fishermen came to me to say   You the guy who helped Maori  Can you help us   And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for    cents a kilo  but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for    dollars a kilo  and the farmers came to talk to me  said   Hey  you helped them. Can you help us   In a year  I had    projects going on  and the government came to see me to say   How can you do that  How can you do      And I said   I do something very  very  very difficult. I shut up  and listen to them.   Laughter  So    Applause    So the government says   Do it again.   Laughter  We've done it in     communities around the world. We have helped to start        businesses. There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude. Peter Drucker  one of the greatest management consultants in history  died age     a few years ago. Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business  and this is what Peter Drucker says   Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy.  Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship. So now you're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy. You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you. You have to offer them confidentiality  privacy  you have to be fantastic at helping them  and then they will come  and they will come in droves. In a community of        people  we get     clients. Can you imagine a community of         people  the intelligence and the passion  Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning  Local  passionate people. That's who you have applauded. So what I'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it's at. We are at the end of the first industrial revolution    nonrenewable fossil fuels  manufacturing    and all of a sudden  we have systems which are not sustainable. The internal combustion engine is not sustainable. Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable. What we have to look at is at how we feed  cure  educate  transport  communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way. The technologies do not exist to do that. Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution  Universities  Forget about it  Government  Forget about it  It will be entrepreneurs  and they're doing it now. There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many  many years ago. There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in     . And in       this group of people came together  and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in     years  and the conclusion was unanimous  The city of New York would not exist in     years. Why  Because they looked at the curve and said  if the population keeps growing at this rate  to move the population of New York around  they would have needed six million horses  and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with. They were already drowning in manure.  Laughter  So       they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York. So what happens  In    years' time  in the year       in the United States of America  there were       car manufacturing companies         . The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over  and there were tiny  tiny little factories in backwaters. Dearborn  Michigan. Henry Ford. However  there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs. First  you have to offer them confidentiality. Otherwise they don't come and talk to you. Then you have to offer them absolute  dedicated  passionate service to them. And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship. The smallest company  the biggest company  has to be capable of doing three things beautifully  The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic  you have to have fantastic marketing  and you have to have tremendous financial management. Guess what  We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it  sell it and look after the money. It doesn't exist. This person has never been born. We've done the research  and we have looked at the     iconic companies of the world    Carnegie  Westinghouse  Edison  Ford  all the new companies  Google  Yahoo. There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common  only one  None were started by one person. Now we teach entrepreneurship to    year olds in Northumberland  and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography  and the task of the    year olds is to underline  in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography how many times Richard uses the word  I  and how many times he uses the word  we.  Never the word  I   and the word  we     times. He wasn't alone when he started. Nobody started a company alone. No one. So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes  in bars  and your dedicated buddies who will do to you  what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic  somebody who will say to you   What do you need  What can you do  Can you make it  Okay  can you sell it  Can you look after the money    Oh  no  I cannot do this.  Would you like me to find you somebody   We activate communities. We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion  the energy and imagination of your own people. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. I'm here to talk about congestion  namely road congestion. Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon. It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world  which is a little bit surprising when you think about it. I mean  think about how different cities are  actually. I mean  you have the typical European cities  with a dense urban core  good public transportation mostly  not a lot of road capacity. But then  on the other hand  you have the American cities. It's moving by itself  okay. Anyway  the American cities  lots of roads dispersed over large areas  almost no public transportation. And then you have the emerging world cities  with a mixed variety of vehicles  mixed land use patterns  also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core. And traffic planners all around the world have tried lots of different measures  dense cities or dispersed cities  lots of roads or lots of public transport or lots of bike lanes or more information  or lots of different things  but nothing seems to work. But all of these attempts have one thing in common. They're basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving. They're essentially  to a point  attempts at planning what other people should do  planning their life for them. Now  planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do  and let me tell you a story. Back in       when the Berlin Wall fell  an urban planner in London got a phone call from a colleague in Moscow saying  basically   Hi  this is Vladimir. I'd like to know  who's in charge of London's bread supply   And the urban planner in London goes   What do you mean  who's in charge of London's   I mean  no one is in charge.   Oh  but surely someone must be in charge. I mean  it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this.   No. No. No one is in charge. I mean  it basically    I haven't really thought of it. It basically organizes itself.  It organizes itself. That's an example of a complex social system which has the ability of self organizing  and this is a very deep insight. When you try to solve really complex social problems  the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives. You don't plan the details  and people will figure out what to do  how to adapt to this new framework. And let's now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion. This is a map of Stockholm  my hometown. Now  Stockholm is a medium sized city  roughly two million people  but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges    narrow bridges  old bridges    which means lots of road congestion. And these red dots show the most congested parts  which are the bridges that lead into the inner city. And then someone came up with the idea that  apart from good public transport  apart from spending money on roads  let's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks. Now  one or two euros  that isn't really a lot of money  I mean compared to parking charges and running costs  etc.  so you would probably expect that car drivers wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge. You would be wrong. One or two euros was enough to make    percent of cars disappear from rush hours. Now     percent  well  that's a fairly huge figure  you might think  but you've still got    percent left of the problem  right  Because you still have    percent of the traffic. Now  that's also wrong  because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon  meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really  really rapidly. But fortunately  it also works the other way around. If you can reduce traffic even somewhat  then congestion will go down much faster than you might think. Now  congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm on January          and the first picture here is a picture of Stockholm  one of the typical streets  January  . The first day with the congestion charges looked like this. This is what happens when you take away    percent of the cars from the streets. You really reduce congestion quite substantially. But  well  as I said  I mean  car drivers adapt  right  So after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges. Wrong again. It's now six and a half years ago since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm  and we basically have the same low traffic levels still. But you see  there's an interesting gap here in the time series in     . Well  the thing is that  the congestion charges  they were introduced first as a trial  so they were introduced in January and then abolished again at the end of July  followed by a referendum  and then they were reintroduced again in       which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity. I mean  this was a really fun experiment to start with  and we actually got to do it twice. And personally  I would like to do this every once a year or so  but they won't let me do that. But it was fun anyway. So  we followed up. What happened  This is the last day with the congestion charges  July     and you see the same street but now it's summer  and summer in Stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year  and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this. All the cars were back again  and you even have to admire the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly. The first day they all came back. And this effect hanged on. So      figures looked like this. Now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know  but I would say that the most surprising slide here I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one. This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm  and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in the beginning of Spring       people were fiercely against it. Seventy percent of the population didn't want this. But what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect  that people hated it more and more. No  on the contrary  they changed  up to a point where we now have    percent support for keeping the charges  meaning that    I mean  let me repeat that     percent of the population in Stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free. Okay. So why can that be  Why is that  Well  think about it this way. Who changed  I mean  the    percent of the car drivers that disappeared  surely they must be discontent in a way. And where did they go  If we can understand this  then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this. Well  so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services  and tried to figure out who changed  and where did they go  And it turned out that they don't know themselves.  Laughter  For some reason  the car drivers are    they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do. And why is that  It's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think. Each day  people make new decisions  and people change and the world changes around them  and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don't even notice. They're not even aware of this themselves. And the other question  who changed their mind  Who changed their opinion  and why  So we did another interview survey  tried to figure out why people changed their mind  and what type of group changed their minds  And after analyzing the answers  it turned out that more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds. They're actually confident that they have liked congestion pricing all along. Which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with    percent  and reduced congestion by enormous numbers  and people aren't even aware that they have changed  and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along. This is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems  and when you do that  you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt. You should just nudge them in the right direction. And if you do it right  people will actually embrace the change  and if you do it right  people will actually even like it. Thank you.  Applause  Life is about opportunities  creating them and embracing them  and for me  that was the Olympic dream. That's what defined me. That was my bliss. As a cross country skier and member of the Australian ski team  headed towards the Winter Olympics  I was on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates. As we made our way up towards the spectacular Blue Mountains west of Sydney  it was the perfect autumn day  sunshine  the smell of eucalypt and a dream. Life was good. We'd been on our bikes for around five and half hours when we got to the part of the ride that I loved  and that was the hills  because I loved the hills. And I got up off the seat of my bike  and I started pumping my legs  and as I sucked in the cold mountain air  I could feel it burning my lungs  and I looked up to see the sun shining in my face. And then everything went black. Where was I  What was happening  My body was consumed by pain. I'd been hit by a speeding utility truck with only    minutes to go on the bike ride. I was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in Sydney. I had extensive and life threatening injuries. I'd broken my neck and my back in six places. I broke five ribs on my left side. I broke my right arm. I broke my collarbone. I broke some bones in my feet. My whole right side was ripped open  filled with gravel. My head was cut open across the front  lifted back  exposing the skull underneath. I had head injures. I had internal injuries. I had massive blood loss. In fact  I lost about five liters of blood  which is all someone my size would actually hold. By the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney  my blood pressure was    over nothing. I was having a really bad day.  Laughter  For over    days  I drifted between two dimensions. I had an awareness of being in my body  but also being out of my body  somewhere else  watching from above as if it was happening to someone else. Why would I want to go back to a body that was so broken  But this voice kept calling me   Come on  stay with me.   No. It's too hard.   Come on. This is our opportunity.   No. That body is broken. It can no longer serve me.   Come on. Stay with me. We can do it. We can do it together.  I was at a crossroads. I knew if I didn't return to my body  I'd have to leave this world forever. It was the fight of my life. After    days  I made the decision to return to my body  and the internal bleeding stopped. The next concern was whether I would walk again  because I was paralyzed from the waist down. They said to my parents  the neck break was a stable fracture  but the back was completely crushed. The vertebra at L  was like you'd dropped a peanut  stepped on it  smashed it into thousands of pieces. They'd have to operate. They went in. They put me on a beanbag. They cut me  literally cut me in half  I have a scar that wraps around my entire body. They picked as much broken bone as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord. They took out two of my broken ribs  and they rebuilt my back  L   they rebuilt it  they took out another broken rib  they fused T    L  and L  together. Then they stitched me up. They took an entire hour to stitch me up. I woke up in intensive care  and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage I had a little bit of movement in one of my big toes  and I thought   Great  because I'm going to the Olympics   I had no idea. That's the sort of thing that happens to someone else  not me  surely. But then the doctor came over to me  and she said   Janine  the operation was a success  and we've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could  but the damage is permanent. The central nervous system nerves  there is no cure. You're what we call a partial paraplegic  and you'll have all of the injuries that go along with that. You have no feeling from the waist down  and at most  you might get     or    percent return. You'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life. You'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life. And if you walk again  it will be with calipers and a walking frame.  And then she said   Janine  you'll have to rethink everything you do in your life  because you're never going to be able to do the things you did before.  I tried to grasp what she was saying. I was an athlete. That's all I knew. That's all I'd done. If I couldn't do that  then what could I do  And the question I asked myself is  if I couldn't do that  then who was I  They moved me from intensive care to acute spinal. I was lying on a thin  hard spinal bed. I had no movement in my legs. I had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots. I had one arm in plaster  one arm tied down by drips. I had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head and I saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head. I shared the ward with five other people  and the amazing thing is that because we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward  we didn't know what each other looked like. How amazing is that  How often in life do you get to make friendships  judgment free  purely based on spirit  And there were no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts  our fears  and our hopes for life after the spinal ward. I remember one night  one of the nurses came in  Jonathan  with a whole lot of plastic straws. He put a pile on top of each of us  and he said   Start threading them together.  Well  there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward  so we did. And when we'd finished  he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward  and then he said   Okay  everybody  hold on to your straws.  And we did. And he said   Right. Now we're all connected.  And as we held on  and we breathed as one  we knew we weren't on this journey alone. And even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward  there were moments of incredible depth and richness  of authenticity and connection that I had never experienced before. And each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same. After six months  it was time to go home. I remember Dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair  wrapped in a plaster body cast  and feeling the sun on my face for the first time. I soaked it up and I thought  how could I ever have taken this for granted  I felt so incredibly grateful for my life. But before I left the hospital  the head nurse had said to me   Janine  I want you to be ready  because when you get home  something's going to happen.  And I said   What   And she said   You're going to get depressed.  And I said   Not me  not Janine the Machine   which was my nickname. She said   You are  because  see  it happens to everyone. In the spinal ward  that's normal. You're in a wheelchair. That's normal. But you're going to get home and realize how different life is.  And I got home and something happened. I realized Sister Sam was right. I did get depressed. I was in my wheelchair. I had no feeling from the waist down  attached to a catheter bottle. I couldn't walk. I'd lost so much weight in the hospital I now weighed about    pounds. And I wanted to give up. All I wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door. I wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back. And I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed  and saying   I wonder if life will ever be good again.  And I thought   How could it  Because I've lost everything that I valued  everything that I'd worked towards. Gone.  And the question I asked was   Why me  Why me   And then I remembered my friends that were still in the spinal ward  particularly Maria. Maria was in a car accident  and she woke up on her   th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic  had no movement from the neck down  had damage to her vocal chords  and she couldn't talk. They told me   We're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her.  I was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her. I knew it would be challenging  but it was actually a blessing  because Maria always smiled. She was always happy  and even when she began to talk again  albeit difficult to understand  she never complained  not once. And I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance. And I realized that this wasn't just my life. It was life itself. I realized that this wasn't just my pain. It was everybody's pain. And then I knew  just like before  that I had a choice. I could keep fighting this or I could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life. And then I stopped asking   Why me   And I started to ask   Why not me   And then I thought to myself  maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start. I had never before thought of myself as a creative person. I was an athlete. My body was a machine. But now I was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do  that of rebuilding a life. And even though I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do  in that uncertainty came a sense of freedom. I was no longer tied to a set path. I was free to explore life's infinite possibilities. And that realization was about to change my life. Sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast  an airplane flew overhead  and I looked up  and I thought to myself   That's it  If I can't walk  then I might as well fly.  I said   Mom  I'm going to learn how to fly.  She said   That's nice  dear.   Laughter  I said   Pass me the yellow pages.  She passed me the phone book  I rang up the flying school  I made a booking  said I'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight. They said   You know  when do you want to come out   I said   Well  I have to get a friend to drive me out because I can't drive. Sort of can't walk either. Is that a problem   I made a booking  and weeks later my friend Chris and my mom drove me out to the airport  all    pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls.  Laughter  I can tell you  I did not look like the ideal candidate to get a pilot's license.  Laughter  I'm holding on to the counter because I can't stand. I said   Hi  I'm here for a flying lesson.  And they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.  You get her.  No  no  you take her.  Finally this guy comes out. He goes   Hi  I'm Andrew  and I'm going to take you flying.  I go   Great.  And so they drive me down  they get me out on the tarmac  and there was this red  white and blue airplane. It was beautiful. They lifted me into the cockpit. They had to slide me up on the wing  put me in the cockpit. They sat me down. There are buttons and dials everywhere. I'm going   Wow  how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do   Andrew the instructor got in the front  started the airplane up. He said   Would you like to have a go at taxiing   That's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground. I said   No  I can't use my legs.  He went   Oh.  I said   But I can use my hands   and he said   Okay.  So he got over to the runway  and he applied the power. And as we took off down the runway  and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac  and we became airborne  I had the most incredible sense of freedom. And Andrew said to me  as we got over the training area   You see that mountain over there   And I said   Yeah.  And he said   Well  you take the controls  and you fly towards that mountain.  And as I looked up  I realized that he was pointing towards the Blue Mountains where the journey had begun. And I took the controls  and I was flying. And I was a long  long way from that spinal ward  and I knew right then that I was going to be a pilot. Didn't know how on Earth I'd ever pass a medical. But I'd worry about that later  because right now I had a dream. So I went home  I got a training diary out  and I had a plan. And I practiced my walking as much as I could  and I went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to the point where I could walk around the furniture as long as it wasn't too far apart. And then I made great progression to the point where I could walk around the house  holding onto the walls  like this  and Mom said she was forever following me  wiping off my fingerprints.  Laughter  But at least she always knew where I was. So while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again  I went on with my theory study  and then eventually  and amazingly  I passed my pilot's medical  and that was my green light to fly. And I spent every moment I could out at that flying school  way out of my comfort zone  all these young guys that wanted to be Qantas pilots  you know  and little old hop along me in first my plaster cast  and then my steel brace  my baggy overalls  my bag of medication and catheters and my limp  and they used to look at me and think   Oh  who is she kidding  She's never going to be able to do this.  And sometimes I thought that too. But that didn't matter  because now there was something inside that burned that far outweighed my injuries. And little goals kept me going along the way  and eventually I got my private pilot's license  and then I learned to navigate  and I flew my friends around Australia. And then I learned to fly an airplane with two engines and I got my twin engine rating. And then I learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating. And then I got my commercial pilot's license. And then I got my instructor rating. And then I found myself back at that same school where I'd gone for that very first flight  teaching other people how to fly  just under    months after I'd left the spinal ward. And then I thought   Why stop there  Why not learn to fly upside down   And I did  and I learned to fly upside down and became an aerobatics flying instructor. And Mom and Dad  Never been up. But then I knew for certain that although my body might be limited  it was my spirit that was unstoppable. The philosopher Lao Tzu once said   When you let go of what you are  you become what you might be.  I now know that it wasn't until I let go of who I thought I was that I was able to create a completely new life. It wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have that I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me. I now know that my real strength never came from my body  and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically  who I am is unchanged. The pilot light inside of me was still a light  just as it is in each and every one of us. I know that I'm not my body  and I also know that you're not yours. And then it no longer matters what you look like  where you come from  or what you do for a living. All that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression of who we really are  because we are all connected by millions and millions of straws  and it's time to join those up and to hang on. And if we are to move towards our collective bliss  it's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart. So raise your straws if you'll join me. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals. There are        species of birds in the world. Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds. When you see a vulture like this  the first thing that comes to your mind is  these are disgusting  ugly  greedy creatures that are just after your flesh  associated with politicians.  Laughter   Applause  I want to change that perception. I want to change those feelings you have for these birds  because they need our sympathy. They really do.  Laughter  And I'll tell you why. First of all  why do they have such a bad press  When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in      on the Beagle  he saw the turkey vulture  and he said   These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity.   Laughter  You could not get a worse insult  and that from Charles Darwin.  Laughter  You know  he changed his mind when he came back  and I'll tell you why. They've also be associated with Disney    Laughter    personified as goofy  dumb  stupid characters. More recently  if you've been following the Kenyan press    Laughter   Applause   Cheers    these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that. I want to challenge that. Do you know why  Because MPs do not keep the environment clean.  Laughter  MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases. They are hardly monogamous.  Laughter   Applause  They are far from being extinct.  Laughter  And  my favorite is  vultures are better looking.  Applause   Laughter  So there's two types of vultures in this planet. There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas  like the condors and the caracaras  and then the Old World vultures  where we have    species. From these        of them are facing a high risk of extinction. So why are vultures important  First of all  they provide vital ecological services. They clean up. They're our natural garbage collectors. They clean up carcasses right to the bone. They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals. Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures  carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose  and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases. Vultures also have tremendous historical significance. They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture. Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood  and together with the cobra  symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt. In Hindu mythology  Jatayu was the vulture god  and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the    headed demon Ravana. In Tibetan culture  they are performing very important sky burials. In places like Tibet  there are no places to bury the dead  or wood to cremate them  so these vultures provide a natural disposal system. So what is the problem with vultures  We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya  of which six are highly threatened with extinction. The reason is that they're getting poisoned  and the reason that they're getting poisoned is because there's human wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators  and in return  the vultures are falling victim to this. In South Asia  in countries like India and Pakistan  four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered  which means they have less than    or    years to go extinct  and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac. This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India  and they have taken a stand. Because there are no vultures  there's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites  and when you have feral dogs  you have a huge time bomb of rabies. The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India. Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa      wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana. I am not against wind energy  but we need to work with the governments  because wind turbines do this to birds. They slice them in half. They are bird blending machines. In West Africa  there's a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market. So what's being done  Well  we're conducting research on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them. We're trying to determine their basic ecology  and see where they go. We can see that they travel different countries  so if you focus on a problem locally  it's not going to help you. We need to work with governments in regional levels. We're working with local communities. We're talking to them about appreciating vultures  about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide. How can you help  You can become active  make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time to spread the word. Spread the word. When you walk out of this room  you will be informed about vultures  but speak to your families  to your children  to your neighbors about vultures. They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies. Kenya  this world  will be much poorer without these wonderful species. Thank you very much.  Applause
