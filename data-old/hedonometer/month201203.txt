Good morning. I'm here today to talk about autonomous flying beach balls. No  agile aerial robots like this one. I'd like to tell you a little bit about the challenges in building these  and some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology. So these robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles. However  the vehicles you see here are big. They weigh thousands of pounds  are not by any means agile. They're not even autonomous. In fact  many of these vehicles are operated by flight crews that can include multiple pilots  operators of sensors  and mission coordinators. What we're interested in is developing robots like this    and here are two other pictures    of robots that you can buy off the shelf. So these are helicopters with four rotors  and they're roughly a meter or so in scale  and weigh several pounds. And so we retrofit these with sensors and processors  and these robots can fly indoors. Without GPS. The robot I'm holding in my hand is this one  and it's been created by two students  Alex and Daniel. So this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound. It consumes about    watts of power. And as you can see  it's about eight inches in diameter. So let me give you just a very quick tutorial on how these robots work. So it has four rotors. If you spin these rotors at the same speed  the robot hovers. If you increase the speed of each of these rotors  then the robot flies up  it accelerates up. Of course  if the robot were tilted  inclined to the horizontal  then it would accelerate in this direction. So to get it to tilt  there's one of two ways of doing it. So in this picture  you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower. And when that happens  there's a moment that causes this robot to roll. And the other way around  if you increase the speed of rotor three and decrease the speed of rotor one  then the robot pitches forward. And then finally  if you spin opposite pairs of rotors faster than the other pair  then the robot yaws about the vertical axis. So an on board processor essentially looks at what motions need to be executed and combines these motions  and figures out what commands to send to the motors        times a second. That's basically how this thing operates. So one of the advantages of this design is when you scale things down  the robot naturally becomes agile. So here  R is the characteristic length of the robot. It's actually half the diameter. And there are lots of physical parameters that change as you reduce R. The one that's most important is the inertia  or the resistance to motion. So it turns out the inertia  which governs angular motion  scales as a fifth power of R. So the smaller you make R  the more dramatically the inertia reduces. So as a result  the angular acceleration  denoted by the Greek letter alpha here  goes as   over R. It's inversely proportional to R. The smaller you make it  the more quickly you can turn. So this should be clear in these videos. On the bottom right  you see a robot performing a     degree flip in less than half a second. Multiple flips  a little more time. So here the processes on board are getting feedback from accelerometers and gyros on board  and calculating  like I said before  commands at     times a second  to stabilize this robot. So on the left  you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air  and it shows you how robust the control is. No matter how you throw it  the robot recovers and comes back to him. So why build robots like this  Well  robots like this have many applications. You can send them inside buildings like this  as first responders to look for intruders  maybe look for biochemical leaks  gaseous leaks. You can also use them for applications like construction. So here are robots carrying beams  columns and assembling cube like structures. I'll tell you a little bit more about this. The robots can be used for transporting cargo. So one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity. So you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads. This is a picture of a recent experiment we did    actually not so recent anymore    in Sendai  shortly after the earthquake. So robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings  to assess the damage after natural disasters  or sent into reactor buildings  to map radiation levels. So one fundamental problem that the robots have to solve if they are to be autonomous  is essentially figuring out how to get from point A to point B. So this gets a little challenging  because the dynamics of this robot are quite complicated. In fact  they live in a    dimensional space. So we use a little trick. We take this curved    dimensional space  and transform it into a flat  four dimensional space. And that four dimensional space consists of X  Y  Z  and then the yaw angle. And so what the robot does  is it plans what we call a minimum snap trajectory. So to remind you of physics  You have position  derivative  velocity  then acceleration  and then comes jerk  and then comes snap. So this robot minimizes snap. So what that effectively does  is produce a smooth and graceful motion. And it does that avoiding obstacles. So these minimum snap trajectories in this flat space are then transformed back into this complicated    dimensional space  which the robot must do for control and then execution. So let me show you some examples of what these minimum snap trajectories look like. And in the first video  you'll see the robot going from point A to point B  through an intermediate point. So the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory. So these are circular trajectories  where the robot pulls about two G's. Here you have overhead motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is     times a second. It also tells the robot where these obstacles are. And the obstacles can be moving. And here  you'll see Daniel throw this hoop into the air  while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop  and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop. So as an academic  we're always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs  and we get our robots to do that. So another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it learns or is pre programmed. So here  you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum  and then changes its orientation and then recovers. So it has to do this because this gap in the window is only slightly larger than the width of the robot. So just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum  and then does this pirouette  this two and a half somersault through and then gracefully recovers  this robot is basically doing that. So it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories to do these fairly difficult tasks. So I want change gears. So one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size. And I told you earlier that we may want to employ lots and lots of robots to overcome the limitations of size. So one difficulty is  How do you coordinate lots of these robots  And so here  we looked to nature. So I want to show you a clip of Aphaenogaster desert ants  in Professor Stephen Pratt's lab  carrying an object. So this is actually a piece of fig. Actually you take any object coated with fig juice  and the ants will carry it back to the nest. So these ants don't have any central coordinator. They sense their neighbors. There's no explicit communication. But because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object  they have implicit coordination across the group. So this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have. So when we have a robot which is surrounded by neighbors    and let's look at robot I and robot J    what we want the robots to do  is to monitor the separation between them  as they fly in formation. And then you want to make sure that this separation is within acceptable levels. So again  the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands     times a second  which then translates into motor commands      times a second. So this also has to be done in a decentralized way. Again  if you have lots and lots of robots  it's impossible to coordinate all this information centrally fast enough in order for the robots to accomplish the task. Plus  the robots have to base their actions only on local information    what they sense from their neighbors. And then finally  we insist that the robots be agnostic to who their neighbors are. So this is what we call anonymity. So what I want to show you next is a video of    of these little robots  flying in formation. They're monitoring their neighbors' positions. They're maintaining formation. The formations can change. They can be planar formations  they can be three dimensional formations. As you can see here  they collapse from a three dimensional formation into planar formation. And to fly through obstacles  they can adapt the formations on the fly. So again  these robots come really close together. As you can see in this figure eight flight  they come within inches of each other. And despite the aerodynamic interactions with these propeller blades  they're able to maintain stable flight. So once you know how to fly in formation  you can actually pick up objects cooperatively. So this just shows that we can double  triple  quadruple the robots' strength  by just getting them to team with neighbors  as you can see here. One of the disadvantages of doing that is  as you scale things up    so if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing  you're essentially increasing the inertia  and therefore you pay a price  they're not as agile. But you do gain in terms of payload carrying capacity. Another application I want to show you    again  this is in our lab. This is work done by Quentin Lindsey  who's a graduate student. So his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss like elements. So his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up  when  and where to place it. So in this video you see    and it's sped up        times    you see three different structures being built by these robots. And again  everything is autonomous  and all Quentin has to do is to give them a blueprint of the design that he wants to build. So all these experiments you've seen thus far  all these demonstrations  have been done with the help of motion capture systems. So what happens when you leave your lab  and you go outside into the real world  And what if there's no GPS  So this robot is actually equipped with a camera  and a laser rangefinder  laser scanner. And it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment. What that map consists of are features    like doorways  windows  people  furniture    and it then figures out where its position is  with respect to the features. So there is no global coordinate system. The coordinate system is defined based on the robot  where it is and what it's looking at. And it navigates with respect to those features. So I want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by Frank Shen and Professor Nathan Michael  that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time  and creating this map on the fly. So the robot then figures out what the features are  it builds the map  it figures out where it is with respect to the features  and then estimates its position     times a second  allowing us to use the control algorithms that I described to you earlier. So this robot is actually being commanded remotely by Frank  but the robot can also figure out where to go on its own. So suppose I were to send this into a building  and I had no idea what this building looked like. I can ask this robot to go in  create a map  and then come back and tell me what the building looks like. So here  the robot is not only solving the problem of how to go from point A to point B in this map  but it's figuring out what the best point B is at every time. So essentially it knows where to go to look for places that have the least information  and that's how it populates this map. So I want to leave you with one last application. And there are many applications of this technology. I'm a professor  and we're passionate about education. Robots like this can really change the way we do K    education. But we're in Southern California  close to Los Angeles  so I have to conclude with something focused on entertainment. I want to conclude with a music video. I want to introduce the creators  Alex and Daniel  who created this video. So before I play this video  I want to tell you that they created it in the last three days  after getting a call from Chris. And the robots that play in the video are completely autonomous. You will see nine robots play six different instruments. And of course  it's made exclusively for TED     . Let's watch. When I was nine years old  I went off to summer camp for the first time. And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books  which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do. Because in my family  reading was the primary group activity. And this might sound antisocial to you  but for us it was really just a different way of being social. You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you  but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind. And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this  but better. I had a vision of    girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns. Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol. And on the very first day  our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit. And it went like this   R O W D I E  that's the way we spell rowdie. Rowdie  rowdie  let's get rowdie.  Yeah. So I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy  or why we had to spell this word incorrectly. But I recited a cheer. I recited a cheer along with everybody else. I did my best. And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books. But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase  the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me   Why are you being so mellow      mellow  of course  being the exact opposite of R O W D I E. And then the second time I tried it  the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing. And so I put my books away  back in their suitcase  and I put them under my bed  and there they stayed for the rest of the summer. And I felt kind of guilty about this. I felt as if the books needed me somehow  and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them. But I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer. Now  I tell you this story about summer camp. I could have told you    others just like it    all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go  that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert. And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were. But for years I denied this intuition  and so I became a Wall Street lawyer  of all things  instead of the writer that I had always longed to be    partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too. And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends. And I made these self negating choices so reflexively  that I wasn't even aware that I was making them. Now this is what many introverts do  and it's our loss for sure  but it is also our colleagues' loss and our communities' loss. And at the risk of sounding grandiose  it is the world's loss. Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership  we need introverts doing what they do best. A third to a half of the population are introverts    a third to a half. So that's one out of every two or three people you know. So even if you're an extrovert yourself  I'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now    all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society. We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing. Now  to see the bias clearly  you need to understand what introversion is. It's different from being shy. Shyness is about fear of social judgment. Introversion is more about  how do you respond to stimulation  including social stimulation. So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation  whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and their most capable when they're in quieter  more low key environments. Not all the time    these things aren't absolute    but a lot of the time. So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us. But now here's where the bias comes in. Our most important institutions  our schools and our workplaces  they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation. And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink  which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place. So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays  When I was going to school  we sat in rows. We sat in rows of desks like this  and we did most of our work pretty autonomously. But nowadays  your typical classroom has pods of desks    four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other. And kids are working in countless group assignments. Even in subjects like math and creative writing  which you think would depend on solo flights of thought  kids are now expected to act as committee members. And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone  those kids are seen as outliers often or  worse  as problem cases. And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert  even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable  according to research. Okay  same thing is true in our workplaces. Now  most of us work in open plan offices  without walls  where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers. And when it comes to leadership  introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions  even though introverts tend to be very careful  much less likely to take outsize risks    which is something we might all favor nowadays. And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do  because when they are managing proactive employees  they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas  whereas an extrovert can  quite unwittingly  get so excited about things that they're putting their own stamp on things  and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface. Now in fact  some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts. I'll give you some examples. Eleanor Roosevelt  Rosa Parks  Gandhi    all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft spoken and even shy. And they all took the spotlight  even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to. And this turns out to have a special power all its own  because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at  they were there because they had no choice  because they were driven to do what they thought was right. Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts. I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts  including my beloved husband. And we all fall at different points  of course  along the introvert extrovert spectrum. Even Carl Jung  the psychologist who first popularized these terms  said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert. He said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum  if he existed at all. And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum  and we call these people ambiverts. And I often think that they have the best of all worlds. But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other. And what I'm saying is that culturally  we need a much better balance. We need more of a yin and yang between these two types. This is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity  because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people  what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas  but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them. And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity. So Darwin  he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations. Theodor Geisel  better known as Dr. Seuss  he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla  California. And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona. Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle in Hewlett Packard where he was working at the time. And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up. Now  of course  this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating    and case in point  is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer    but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe. And in fact  we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude. It's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it. If you look at most of the world's major religions  you will find seekers    Moses  Jesus  Buddha  Muhammad    seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness  where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community. So  no wilderness  no revelations. This is no surprise  though  if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology. It turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring  mimicking their opinions. Even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to  you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that's what you're doing. And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room  even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas    I mean zero. So    You might be following the person with the best ideas  but you might not. And do you really want to leave it up to chance  Much better for everybody to go off by themselves  generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics  and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well managed environment and take it from there. Now if all this is true  then why are we getting it so wrong  Why are we setting up our schools this way  and our workplaces  And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time  One answer lies deep in our cultural history. Western societies  and in particular the U.S.  have always favored the man of action over the  man  of contemplation. But in America's early days  we lived in what historians call a culture of character  where we still  at that point  valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude. And if you look at the self help books from this era  they all had titles with things like  Character  the Grandest Thing in the World.  And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln  who was praised for being modest and unassuming. Ralph Waldo Emerson called him  A man who does not offend by superiority.  But then we hit the   th century  and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality. What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business. And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities. And instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives  now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers. So  quite understandably  qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important. And sure enough  the self help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like  How to Win Friends and Influence People.  And they feature as their role models really great salesmen. So that's the world we're living in today. That's our cultural inheritance. Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant  and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all. The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust. And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together. But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves  the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems. So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today. Guess what  Books. I have a suitcase full of books. Here's Margaret Atwood   Cat's Eye.  Here's a novel by Milan Kundera. And here's  The Guide for the Perplexed  by Maimonides. But these are not exactly my books. I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors. My grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up  partly because it was filled with his very gentle  very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books. I mean literally every table  every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books. Just like the rest of my family  my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read. But he also loved his congregation  and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the    years that he was a rabbi. He would takes the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought. And people would come from all over to hear him speak. But here's the thing about my grandfather. Underneath this ceremonial role  he was really modest and really introverted    so much so that when he delivered these sermons  he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for    years. And even away from the podium  when you called him to say hello  he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time. But when he died at the age of     the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him. And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way. So I just published a book about introversion  and it took me about seven years to write. And for me  that seven years was like total bliss  because I was reading  I was writing  I was thinking  I was researching. It was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library. But now all of a sudden my job is very different  and my job is to be out here talking about it  talking about introversion. And that's a lot harder for me  because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now  this is not my natural milieu. So I prepared for moments like these as best I could. I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get. And I call this my  year of speaking dangerously.  And that actually helped a lot. But I'll tell you  what helps even more is my sense  my belief  my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude  we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change. I mean  we are. And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision. Number one  Stop the madness for constant group work. Just stop it. Thank you. And I want to be clear about what I'm saying  because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual  chatty cafe style types of interactions    you know  the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas. That is great. It's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts. But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work. School  same thing. We need to be teaching kids to work together  for sure  but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own. This is especially important for extroverted children too. They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part. Okay  number two  Go to the wilderness. Be like Buddha  have your own revelations. I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again  but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often. Number three  Take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there. So extroverts  maybe your suitcases are also full of books. Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment. Whatever it is  I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy. But introverts  you being you  you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase. And that's okay. But occasionally  just occasionally  I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see  because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry. So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me. I spend most of my time in jails  in prisons  on death row. I spend most of my time in very low income communities in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness. And being here at TED and seeing the stimulation  hearing it  has been very  very energizing to me. And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity. And you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world. And sometimes when it comes through TED  it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't. And I mention that because I think identity is really important. And we've had some fantastic presentations. And I think what we've learned is that  if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful  but if you're a compassionate teacher  they can be especially meaningful. If you're a doctor you can do some good things  but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things. And so I want to talk about the power of identity. And I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do. I actually learned about this from my grandmother. I grew up in a house that was the traditional African American home that was dominated by a matriarch  and that matriarch was my grandmother. She was tough  she was strong  she was powerful. She was the end of every argument in our family. She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family. She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved. Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the     's. She was born in the     's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world. And my grandmother was tough  but she was also loving. When I would see her as a little boy  she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs. And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go. And an hour or two later  if I saw her  she'd come over to me and she'd say   Bryan  do you still feel me hugging you   And if I said   No   she'd assault me again  and if I said   Yes   she'd leave me alone. And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her. And the only challenge was that she had    children. My mom was the youngest of her    kids. And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her  it would be difficult to get her time and attention. My cousins would be running around everywhere. And I remember  when I was about eight or nine years old  waking up one morning  going into the living room  and all of my cousins were running around. And my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me. And at first I thought we were playing a game. And I would look at her and I'd smile  but she was very serious. And after about    or    minutes of this  she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said   Come on  Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk.  And I remember this just like it happened yesterday. I never will forget it. She took me out back and she said   Bryan  I'm going to tell you something  but you don't tell anybody what I tell you.  I said   Okay  Mama.  She said   Now you make sure you don't do that.  I said   Sure.  Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said   I want you to know I've been watching you.  And she said   I think you're special.  She said   I think you can do anything you want to do.  I will never forget it. And then she said   I just need you to promise me three things  Bryan.  I said   Okay  Mama.  She said   The first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom.  She said   That's my baby girl  and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her.  Well I adored my mom  so I said   Yes  Mama. I'll do that.  Then she said   The second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing.  And I thought about it and I said   Yes  Mama. I'll do that.  Then finally she said   The third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol.  Well I was nine years old  so I said   Yes  Mama. I'll do that.  I grew up in the country in the rural South  and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger. When I was about    or     one day my brother came home and he had this six pack of beer    I don't know where he got it    and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods. And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did. And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some  and they offered it to me. I said   No  no  no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer.  My brother said   Come on. We're doing this today  you always do what we do. I had some  your sister had some. Have some beer.  I said   No  I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead.  And then my brother started staring at me. He said   What's wrong with you  Have some beer.  Then he looked at me real hard and he said   Oh  I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you.  I said   Well  what are you talking about   He said   Oh  Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special.  I was devastated. And I'm going to admit something to you. I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't. I know this might be broadcast broadly. But I'm    years old  and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol. I don't say that because I think that's virtuous  I say that because there is power in identity. When we create the right kind of identity  we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sense. We can get them to do things that they don't think they can do. When I thought about my grandmother  of course she would think all her grandkids were special. My grandfather was in prison during prohibition. My male uncles died of alcohol related diseases. And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to. Well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system. This country is very different today than it was    years ago. In       there were         people in jails and prisons. Today  there are  .  million. The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. We have seven million people on probation and parole. And mass incarceration  in my judgment  has fundamentally changed our world. In poor communities  in communities of color there is this despair  there is this hopelessness  that is being shaped by these outcomes. One out of three black men between the ages of    and    is in jail  in prison  on probation or parole. In urban communities across this country    Los Angeles  Philadelphia  Baltimore  Washington       to    percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole. Our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race  they're also distorted by poverty. We have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. Wealth  not culpability  shapes outcomes. And yet  we seem to be very comfortable. The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems. We've been disconnected. It's interesting to me. We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work. My state of Alabama  like a number of states  actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction. Right now in Alabama    percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote. We're actually projecting in another    years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. And there is this stunning silence. I represent children. A lot of my clients are very young. The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence    year old children to die in prison. We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country. And we're actually doing some litigation. The only country in the world. I represent people on death row. It's interesting  this question of the death penalty. In many ways  we've been taught to think that the real question is  do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed  And that's a very sensible question. But there's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity. The other way of thinking about it is not  do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit  but do we deserve to kill  I mean  it's fascinating. Death penalty in America is defined by error. For every nine people who have been executed  we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death row. A kind of astonishing error rate    one out of nine people innocent. I mean  it's fascinating. In aviation  we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash. But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem. It's not our problem. It's not our burden. It's not our struggle. I talk a lot about these issues. I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill. And it's interesting  when I teach my students about African American history  I tell them about slavery. I tell them about terrorism  the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II. We don't really know very much about it. But for African Americans in this country  that was an era defined by terror. In many communities  people had to worry about being lynched. They had to worry about being bombed. It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives. And these older people come up to me now and they say   Mr. Stevenson  you give talks  you make speeches  you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after     .  They tell me to say   No  tell them that we grew up with that.  And that era of terrorism  of course  was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid. And yet  we have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems. We don't like to talk about our history. And because of that  we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically. We're constantly running into each other. We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts. We have a hard time talking about race  and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation. In South Africa  people understood that we couldn't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation. In Rwanda  even after the genocide  there was this commitment  but in this country we haven't done that. I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty. It was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said   Well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about.  He said   We don't have the death penalty in Germany. And of course  we can never have the death penalty in Germany.  And the room got very quiet  and this woman said   There's no way  with our history  we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings. It would be unconscionable for us to  in an intentional and deliberate way  set about executing people.  And I thought about that. What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people  especially if they were disproportionately Jewish  I couldn't bear it. It would be unconscionable. And yet  in this country  in the states of the Old South  we execute people    where you're    times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black     times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white    in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched. And yet  there is this disconnect. Well I believe that our identity is at risk. That when we actually don't care about these difficult things  the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated. We love innovation. We love technology. We love creativity. We love entertainment. But ultimately  those realities are shadowed by suffering  abuse  degradation  marginalization. And for me  it becomes necessary to integrate the two. Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful  more committed  more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world. And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor  the disadvantaged  those who will never get to TED. But thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives. You know ultimately  we all have to believe things we haven't seen. We do. As rational as we are  as committed to intellect as we are. Innovation  creativity  development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone. They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart. And it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things  but also the dark and difficult things. Vaclav Havel  the great Czech leader  talked about this. He said   When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression  we wanted all kinds of things  but mostly what we needed was hope  an orientation of the spirit  a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness.  Well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in. There is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering  to poverty  to exclusion  to unfairness  to injustice. Now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this. It will get to you. I had the great privilege  when I was a young lawyer  of meeting Rosa Parks. And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then  and she would get together with two of her dearest friends  these older women  Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott    amazing African American woman    and Virginia Durr  a white woman  whose husband  Clifford Durr  represented Dr. King. And these women would get together and just talk. And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me  and she'd say   Bryan  Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk. Do you want to come over and listen   And I'd say   Yes  Ma'am  I do.  And she'd say   Well what are you going to do when you get here   I said   I'm going to listen.  And I'd go over there and I would  I would just listen. It would be so energizing and so empowering. And one time I was over there listening to these women talk  and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said   Now Bryan  tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is. Tell me what you're trying to do.  And I began giving her my rap. I said   Well we're trying to challenge injustice. We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted. We're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice. We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children. We're trying to do something about the death penalty. We're trying to reduce the prison population. We're trying to end mass incarceration.  I gave her my whole rap  and when I finished she looked at me and she said   Mmm mmm mmm.  She said   That's going to make you tired  tired  tired.  And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward  she put her finger in my face  she said   That's why you've got to be brave  brave  brave.  And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more courageous. We need to find ways to embrace these challenges  these problems  the suffering. Because ultimately  our humanity depends on everyone's humanity. I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do. It's just taught me very simple things. I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done. I believe that for every person on the planet. I think if somebody tells a lie  they're not just a liar. I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them  they're not just a thief. I think even if you kill someone  you're not just a killer. And because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law. I also believe that in many parts of this country  and certainly in many parts of this globe  that the opposite of poverty is not wealth. I don't believe that. I actually think  in too many places  the opposite of poverty is justice. And finally  I believe that  despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating  we will ultimately not be judged by our technology  we won't be judged by our design  we won't be judged by our intellect and reason. Ultimately  you judge the character of a society  not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged  but by how they treat the poor  the condemned  the incarcerated. Because it's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are. I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story. I sometimes push too hard. I do get tired  as we all do. Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important. And I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences. And I go to the jail and I see my client who's    and     and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult. I start thinking  well  how did that happen  How can a judge turn you into something that you're not  And the judge has certified him as an adult  but I see this kid. And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking  well gosh  if the judge can turn you into something that you're not  the judge must have magic power. Yeah  Bryan  the judge has some magic power. You should ask for some of that. And because I was up too late  wasn't thinking real straight  I started working on a motion. And I had a client who was    years old  a young  poor black kid. And I started working on this motion  and the head of the motion was   Motion to try my poor     year old black male client like a privileged  white    year old corporate executive.  And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct. There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county  it's all misconduct. And the next morning  I woke up and I thought  now did I dream that crazy motion  or did I actually write it  And to my horror  not only had I written it  but I had sent it to court. A couple months went by  and I had just forgotten all about it. And I finally decided  oh gosh  I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case. And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed    overwhelmed. And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse. And I was thinking  this is going to be so difficult  so painful. And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse. And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse  there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse. When this man saw me  he came over to me and he said   Who are you   I said   I'm a lawyer.  He said   You're a lawyer   I said   Yes  sir.  And this man came over to me and he hugged me. And he whispered in my ear. He said   I'm so proud of you.  And I have to tell you  it was energizing. It connected deeply with something in me about identity  about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community  to a perspective that is hopeful. Well I went into the courtroom. And as soon as I walked inside  the judge saw me coming in. He said   Mr. Stevenson  did you write this crazy motion   I said   Yes  sir. I did.  And we started arguing. And people started coming in because they were just outraged. I had written these crazy things. And police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers. And before I knew it  the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race  that we were talking about poverty  that we were talking about inequality. And out of the corner of my eye  I could see this janitor pacing back and forth. And he kept looking through the window  and he could hear all of this holler. He kept pacing back and forth. And finally  this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me  almost at counsel table. About    minutes later the judge said we would take a break. And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court. And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man. He said   Jimmy  what are you doing in this courtroom   And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said   I came into this courtroom to tell this young man  keep your eyes on the prize  hold on.  I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long  but it bends toward justice. That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity. That all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone. That our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity  compassion and justice. And more than anything  for those of you who share that  I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize  hold on. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience  this community  to help you on your way and to do something on this issue. Other than writing a check  what could we do  BS  Well there are opportunities all around us. If you live in the state of California  for example  there's a referendum coming up this spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment. For example  here in California we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years    one billion dollars. And yet     percent of all homicide cases don't result in arrest.    percent of all rape cases don't result. So there's an opportunity to change that. And this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety. And I think that opportunity exists all around us. CA  There's been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades. And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates. What would you say to someone who believed that  BS  Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable. The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories. It was this misguided war on drugs. That's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population. And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment. And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle  for low level property crimes  rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized. I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime  not do less. And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one. And I think that's the orientation that we have to change. CA  Bryan  you've struck a massive chord here. You're an inspiring person. Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you. A tourist is backpacking through the highlands of Scotland  and he stops at a pub to get a drink. And the only people in there is a bartender and an old man nursing a beer. And he orders a pint  and they sit in silence for a while. And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes   You see this bar  I built this bar with my bare hands from the finest wood in the county. Gave it more love and care than my own child. But do they call me MacGregor the bar builder  No.  Points out the window.  You see that stone wall out there  I built that stone wall with my bare hands. Found every stone  placed them just so through the rain and the cold. But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder  No.  Points out the window.  You see that pier on the lake out there  I built that pier with my bare hands. Drove the pilings against the tide of the sand  plank by plank. But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder  No. But you fuck one goat ...   Storytelling    is joke telling. It's knowing your punchline  your ending  knowing that everything you're saying  from the first sentence to the last  is leading to a singular goal  and ideally confirming some truth that deepens our understandings of who we are as human beings. We all love stories. We're born for them. Stories affirm who we are. We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning. And nothing does a greater affirmation than when we connect through stories. It can cross the barriers of time  past  present and future  and allow us to experience the similarities between ourselves and through others  real and imagined. The children's television host Mr. Rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker that said   Frankly  there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story.  And the way I like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment  which is  Make me care     please  emotionally  intellectually  aesthetically  just make me care. We all know what it's like to not care. You've gone through hundreds of TV channels  just switching channel after channel  and then suddenly you actually stop on one. It's already halfway over  but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care. That's not by chance  that's by design. So it got me thinking  what if I told you my history was story  how I was born for it  how I learned along the way this subject matter  And to make it more interesting  we'll start from the ending and we'll go to the beginning. And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story  it would go something like this  And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TED about story. And the most current story lesson that I've had was completing the film I've just done this year in     . The film is  John Carter.  It's based on a book called  The Princess of Mars   which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself as a character inside this movie  and as the narrator. And he's summoned by his rich uncle  John Carter  to his mansion with a telegram saying   See me at once.  But once he gets there  he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property. Thing only opens from the inside. He insisted  no embalming  no open coffin  no funeral. You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded by being like the rest of us  huh  Come  let's go inside. AS  What this scene is doing  and it did in the book  is it's fundamentally making a promise. It's making a promise to you that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time. And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning  is they should give you a promise. You could do it an infinite amount of ways. Sometimes it's as simple as  Once upon a time ...   These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it. And I always thought it was such a fantastic device. It's like a guy inviting you around the campfire  or somebody in a bar saying   Here  let me tell you a story. It didn't happen to me  it happened to somebody else  but it's going to be worth your time.  A well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end. In       I pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time to the limits of my understanding on this project.   And that is all     that love's about     And we'll recall     when time runs out     That it only   AS  Storytelling without dialogue. It's the purest form of cinematic storytelling. It's the most inclusive approach you can take. It confirmed something I really had a hunch on  is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal. They just don't want to know that they're doing that. That's your job as a storyteller  is to hide the fact that you're making them work for their meal. We're born problem solvers. We're compelled to deduce and to deduct  because that's what we do in real life. It's this well organized absence of information that draws us in. There's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy. It's not just that they're damn cute  it's because they can't completely express what they're thinking and what their intentions are. And it's like a magnet. We can't stop ourselves from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in. I first started really understanding this storytelling device when I was writing with Bob Peterson on  Finding Nemo.  And we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two. Make the audience put things together. Don't give them four  give them two plus two. The elements you provide and the order you place them in is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience. Editors and screenwriters have known this all along. It's the invisible application that holds our attention to story. I don't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science  it's not. That's what's so special about stories  they're not a widget  they aren't exact. Stories are inevitable  if they're good  but they're not predictable. I took a seminar in this year with an acting teacher named Judith Weston. And I learned a key insight to character. She believed that all well drawn characters have a spine. And the idea is that the character has an inner motor  a dominant  unconscious goal that they're striving for  an itch that they can't scratch. She gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone  Al Pacino's character in  The Godfather   and that probably his spine was to please his father. And it's something that always drove all his choices. Even after his father died  he was still trying to scratch that itch. I took to this like a duck to water. Wall E's was to find the beauty. Marlin's  the father in  Finding Nemo   was to prevent harm. And Woody's was to do what was best for his child. And these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices. Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them. I'm really blessed to be a parent  and watching my children grow  I really firmly believe that you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way  and you don't have any say about it  and there's no changing it. All you can do is learn to recognize it and own it. And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive  some are negative. But a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it. As parents  you're always learning who your children are. They're learning who they are. And you're still learning who you are. So we're all learning all the time. And that's why change is fundamental in story. If things go static  stories die  because life is never static. In       I had finished writing  Toy Story  and  A Bug's Life  and I was completely hooked on screenwriting. So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could. So I researched everything I possibly could. And I finally came across this fantastic quote by a British playwright  William Archer   Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty.  It's an incredibly insightful definition. When you're telling a story  have you constructed anticipation  In the short term  have you made me want to know what will happen next  But more importantly  have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long term  Have you constructed honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt in what the outcome might be  An example would be in  Finding Nemo   in the short tension  you were always worried  would Dory's short term memory make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin. But under that was this global tension of will we ever find Nemo in this huge  vast ocean  In our earliest days at Pixar  before we truly understood the invisible workings of story  we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut  going on our instincts. And it's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good. You've got to remember that in this time of year        what was considered a successful animated picture was  The Little Mermaid    Beauty and the Beast    Aladdin    Lion King.  So when we pitched  Toy Story  to Tom Hanks for the first time  he walked in and he said   You don't want me to sing  do you   And I thought that epitomized perfectly what everybody thought animation had to be at the time. But we really wanted to prove that you could tell stories completely different in animation. We didn't have any influence then  so we had a little secret list of rules that we kept to ourselves. And they were  No songs  no  I want  moment  no happy village  no love story. And the irony is that  in the first year  our story was not working at all and Disney was panicking. So they privately got advice from a famous lyricist  who I won't name  and he faxed them some suggestions. And we got a hold of that fax. And the fax said  there should be songs  there should be an  I want  song  there should be a happy village song  there should be a love story and there should be a villain. And thank goodness we were just too young  rebellious and contrarian at the time. That just gave us more determination to prove that you could build a better story. And a year after that  we did conquer it. And it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines  not hard  fast rules. Another fundamental thing we learned was about liking your main character. And we had naively thought  well Woody in  Toy Story  has to become selfless at the end  so you've got to start from someplace. So let's make him selfish. And this is what you get. Off the bed. Hey  off the bed  Mr. Potato Head  You going to make us  Woody  Woody  No  he is. Slinky  Slink ... Slinky  Get up here and do your job. Are you deaf  I said  take care of them. Slinky  I'm sorry  Woody  but I have to agree with them. I don't think what you did was right. Woody  What  Am I hearing correctly  You don't think I was right  Who said your job was to think  Spring Wiener  AS  So how do you make a selfish character likable  We realized  you can make him kind  generous  funny  considerate  as long as one condition is met for him  is that he stays the top toy. And that's what it really is  is that we all live life conditionally. We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along  as long as certain conditions are met. After that  all bets are off. And before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career  I can now see key things that happened in my youth that really sort of opened my eyes to certain things about story. In       I truly understood the notion of story having a theme. And that was the year that they restored and re released  Lawrence of Arabia.  And I saw that thing seven times in one month. I couldn't get enough of it. I could just tell there was a grand design under it    in every shot  every scene  every line. Yet  on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on. Yet  there was something more being said. What exactly was it  And it wasn't until  on one of my later viewings  that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert and he's reached the Suez Canal  and I suddenly got it. Cyclist  Who are you  Who are you  AS  That was the theme  Who are you  Here were all these seemingly disparate events and dialogues that just were chronologically telling the history of him  but underneath it was a constant  a guideline  a road map. Everything Lawrence did in that movie was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world. A strong theme is always running through a well told story. When I was five  I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient that I feel a story should have  but is rarely invoked. And this is what my mother took me to when I was five. Look. The water's stiff. Bambi  Yippee  Thumper  Some fun  huh  Bambi  Come on. Get up. Like this. Ha ha. No  no  no. AS  I walked out of there wide eyed with wonder. And that's what I think the magic ingredient is  the secret sauce  is can you invoke wonder. Wonder is honest  it's completely innocent. It can't be artificially evoked. For me  there's no greater ability than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling    to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day and have them surrender to wonder. When it's tapped  the affirmation of being alive  it reaches you almost to a cellular level. And when an artist does that to another artist  it's like you're compelled to pass it on. It's like a dormant command that suddenly is activated in you  like a call to Devil's Tower. Do unto others what's been done to you. The best stories infuse wonder. When I was four years old  I have a vivid memory of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle and asking my dad what they were. And he said I had a matching pair like that on my head  but I couldn't see them because of my hair. And he explained that when I was born  I was born premature  that I came out much too early  and I wasn't fully baked  I was very  very sick. And when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth  he looked straight at my mom and said   He's not going to live.  And I was in the hospital for months. And many blood transfusions later  I lived  and that made me special. I don't know if I really believe that. I don't know if my parents really believe that  but I didn't want to prove them wrong. Whatever I ended up being good at  I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given. Marlin  There  there  there. It's okay  daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise  I will never let anything happen to you  Nemo. AS  And that's the first story lesson I ever learned. Use what you know. Draw from it. It doesn't always mean plot or fact. It means capturing a truth from your experiencing it  expressing values you personally feel deep down in your core. And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TEDTalk today. Thank you. What do I know that would cause me  a reticent  Midwestern scientist  to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting  And what would you do if you knew what I know  Let's start with how I got to this point. I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university. And I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first U.S. satellites. Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus  that there was intense microwave radiation. Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere  Or was Venus extremely hot  The right answer  confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft  was that Venus was very hot        degrees Fahrenheit. And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus. Our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus  which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid. But while our instrument was being built  I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth  because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing. Eventually  I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important. Its changes will affect all of humanity. The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century. British physicist John Tyndall  in the     's  made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation  which is heat. And he showed that gasses such as CO  absorb heat  thus acting like a blanket warming Earth's surface. I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations. In       we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of  .  degrees Celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO . That Earth would likely warm in the     's  and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century. We also said that the   st century would see shifting climate zones  creation of drought prone regions in North America and Asia  erosion of ice sheets  rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage. All of these impacts have since either happened or are now well under way. That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to Congress in the     's  testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth's water cycle. Heatwaves and droughts on one hand  directly from the warming  but also  because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy  rainfall will become in more extreme events. There will be stronger storms and greater flooding. Global warming hoopla became time consuming and distracted me from doing science    partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony. So I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others. By    years later  evidence of global warming was much stronger. Most of the things mentioned in our      paper were facts. I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force. But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels. By then we had two grandchildren  Sophie and Connor. I decided that I did not want them in the future to say   Opa understood what was happening  but he didn't make it clear.  So I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy. I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in      and at the      meeting of the American Geophysical Union. This led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters. After I informed the New York Times about these restrictions  NASA was forced to end the censorship. But there were consequences. I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement   To understand and protect the home planet   to justify my talks. Soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted  never to appear again. Over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies  while still researching the physics of climate change. Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics    first  from Earth's energy balance and  second  from Earth's climate history. Adding CO  to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed. It reduces Earth's heat radiation to space  so there's a temporary energy imbalance. More energy is coming in than going out  until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun. So the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance. Is there more energy coming in than going out  If so  more warming is in the pipeline. It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses. Now finally  we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs. The biggest reservoir  the ocean  was the least well measured  until more than       Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean. These floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate. The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate  and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet. And the land  to depths of tens of meters  is also warming. The total energy imbalance now is about six tenths of a watt per square meter. That may not sound like much  but when added up over the whole world  it's enormous. It's about    times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity. It's equivalent to exploding         Hiroshima atomic bombs per day     days per year. That's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day. This imbalance  if we want to stabilize climate  means that we must reduce CO  from     ppm  parts per million  back to     ppm. That is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming. Climate change deniers argue that the Sun is the main cause of climate change. But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record  when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least. Yet  there was more energy coming in than going out. This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses  mainly from burning fossil fuels. Now consider Earth's climate history. These curves for global temperature  atmospheric CO  and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores  from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over         years forming a two mile thick ice sheet. As you see  there's a high correlation between temperature  CO  and sea level. Careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO  changes by a few centuries. Climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying   Look  the temperature causes CO  to change  not vice versa.  But that lag is exactly what is expected. Small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth. When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer  ice sheets melt. Shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker  so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer. A warmer ocean releases CO   just as a warm Coca Cola does. And more CO  causes more warming. So CO   methane  and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge  even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing. The important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today. The physics does not change. As Earth warms  now because of extra CO  we put in the atmosphere  ice will melt  and CO  and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost. While we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur  it is certain they will occur  unless we stop the warming. There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning. Precise measurements by GRACE  the gravity satellite  reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass  several hundred cubic kilometers per year. And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago. Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost. What sea level rise can we look forward to  The last time CO  was     ppm  today's value  sea level was higher by at least    meters     feet. Where you are sitting now would be under water. Most estimates are that  this century  we will get at least one meter. I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels  perhaps even five meters  which is    feet  this century or shortly thereafter. The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity's control. Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries. There would be no stable shoreline. The economic consequences are almost unthinkable. Hundreds of New Orleans like devastations around the world. What may be more reprehensible  if climate denial continues  is extermination of species. The monarch butterfly could be one of the    to    percent of all species that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use. Global warming is already affecting people. The Texas  Oklahoma  Mexico heatwave and drought last year  Moscow the year before and Europe in       were all exceptional events  more than three standard deviations outside the norm. Fifty years ago  such anomalies covered only two  to three tenths of one percent of the land area. In recent years  because of global warming  they now cover about    percent    an increase by a factor of    to   . So we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves were not natural  they were caused by global warming. An important impact  if global warming continues  will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world  the Midwest and Great Plains  which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts  worse than the Dust Bowl  within just a few decades  if we let global warming continue. How did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate  giving talks in    countries  getting arrested  burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over    years  More grandchildren helped me along. Jake is a super positive  enthusiastic boy. Here at age two and a half years  he thinks he can protect his two and a half day old little sister. It would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control. Now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple  honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed     percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis  with the government not keeping one dime. Most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they'd pay in increased prices. This fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations  creating millions of jobs. It is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future. Several top economists are coauthors on this proposition. Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly   Transparent. Market based. Does not enlarge government. Leaves energy decisions to individual choices. Sounds like a conservative climate plan.  But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society  our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by     to     billion dollars per year worldwide  thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel    mountaintop removal  longwall mining  fracking  tar sands  tar shale  deep ocean Arctic drilling. This path  if continued  guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations. A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction. And increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world  causing massive famines and economic decline. Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth. That is the equivalent of what we face now. Yet  we dither  taking no action to divert the asteroid  even though the longer we wait  the more difficult and expensive it becomes. If we had started in       it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century. If we start next year  it is six percent per year. If we wait    years  it is    percent per year    extremely difficult and expensive  perhaps impossible. But we aren't even starting. So now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm. Clearly  I haven't gotten this message across. The science is clear. I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively. We owe it to our children and grandchildren. Thank you. So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate  we have them work in government. The program is called Code for America  and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks. We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments. Instead of sending them off into the Third World  we send them into the wilds of City Hall. And there they make great apps  they work with city staffers. But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today. So meet Al. Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston. Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date  but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in  because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow. Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner  We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program. They were there in February  and it snowed a lot in February last year. And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants. But one fellow in particular  a guy named Erik Michaels Ober  noticed something else  and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things. So he did what any good developer would do  he wrote an app. It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant. So you agree to dig it out when it snows. If you do  you get to name it  and he called the first one Al. And if you don't  someone can steal it from you. So it's got cute little game dynamics on it. This is a modest little app. It's probably the smallest of the    apps that the fellows wrote last year. But it's doing something that no other government technology does. It's spreading virally. There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it  not for snow  but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens. It's very important that these tsunami sirens work  but people steal the batteries out of them. So he's getting citizens to check on them. And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains. And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows. So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this. And this has spread just frictionlessly  organically  naturally. If you know anything about government technology  you know that this isn't how it normally goes. Procuring software usually takes a couple of years. We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months. It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids. We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels  it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars. And that's nothing. There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars  and it doesn't work. And there are projects like this at every level of government. So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally  that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government. It suggests how government could work better    not more like a private company  as many people think it should. And not even like a tech company  but more like the Internet itself. And that means permissionless  it means open  it means generative. And that's important. But what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government    not as the problem of an ossified institution  but as a problem of collective action. And that's great news  because  it turns out  we're very good at collective action with digital technology. Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively. It's not just Code for America fellows  there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities. They haven't given up on government. They are frustrated as hell with it  but they're not complaining about it  they're fixing it. And these folks know something that we've lost sight of. And that's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we're really mad about  government is  at its core  in the words of Tim O'Reilly   What we do together that we can't do alone.  Now a lot of people have given up on government. And if you're one of those people  I would ask that you reconsider  because things are changing. Politics is not changing  government is changing. And because government ultimately derives its power from us    remember  We the people      how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens. Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program. And like a lot of people  I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office. Well after two years  I've come to the conclusion that  especially local government  is about opossums. This is the call center for the services and information line. It's generally where you will get if you call     in your city. If you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center  as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program    in fact  they all do that    you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues  including having an opossum stuck in your house. So Scott gets this call. He types  Opossum  into this official knowledge base. He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control. And finally  he says   Look  can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves   So that worked. So booya for Scott. But that wasn't the end of the opossums. Boston doesn't just have a call center. It has an app  a Web and mobile app  called Citizens Connect. Now we didn't write this app. This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston. So one day    this is an actual report    this came in   Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead. How do I get this removed   But what happens with Citizens Connect is different. So Scott was speaking person to person. But on Citizens Connect everything is public  so everybody can see this. And in this case  a neighbor saw it. And the next report we got said   I walked over to this location  found the trashcan behind the house. Opossum  Check. Living  Yep. Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home. Goodnight sweet opossum.  Pretty simple. So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical. And it's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd sourcing game. But it's also a great example of government as a platform. And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here. I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others. So one citizen helped another citizen  but government played a key role here. It connected those two people. And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed  but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services. When one neighbor helps another  we strengthen our communities. We call animal control  it just costs a lot of money. Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics. And most people get that  but they think that one is the input to the other. That our input to the system of government is voting. Now how many times have we elected a political leader    and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected    and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs  and then not that much changes  That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six inch layer on top. And what's under that is what we call bureaucracy. And we say that word with such contempt. But it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that's working against us  this other thing  and then we're disempowering ourselves. People seem to think politics is sexy. If we want this institution to work for us  we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy. Because that's where the real work of government happens. We have to engage with the machinery of government. So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done. Have you seen these guys  It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed     page report that's a response to the SEC's request for comment on the Financial Reform Bill. That's not being politically active  that's being bureaucratically active. Now for those of us who've given up on government  it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children. You have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face. Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us  We can't do without government  but we do need it to be more effective. The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society. And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet  and they know that it's not that hard to do things together  you just have to architect the systems the right way. Now the average age of our fellows is     so I am  begrudgingly  almost a generation older than most of them. This is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted. They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak  they all get to speak. They can express their opinion on any channel at any time  and they do. So when they're faced with the problem of government  they don't care as much about using their voices. They're using their hands. They're using their hands to write applications that make government work better. And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better. That could be shoveling out a hydrant  pulling a weed  turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it. And certainly  we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along  and many people do. But these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers  and we're not just consumers of government  putting in our taxes and getting back services. We're more than that  we're citizens. And we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship. So the question I have for all of you here  When it comes to the big  important things that we need to do together  all of us together  are we just going to be a crowd of voices  or are we also going to be a crowd of hands  Thank you. I want to discuss with you this afternoon why you're going to fail to have a great career. I'm an economist. I do dismal. End of the day  it's ready for dismal remarks. I only want to talk to those of you who want a great career. I know some of you have already decided you want a good career. You're going to fail  too. Because    goodness  you're all cheery about failing. Canadian group  undoubtedly. Those trying to have good careers are going to fail  because  really  good jobs are now disappearing. There are great jobs and great careers  and then there are the high workload  high stress  bloodsucking  soul destroying kinds of jobs  and practically nothing in between. So people looking for good jobs are going to fail. I want to talk about those looking for great jobs  great careers  and why you're going to fail. First reason is that no matter how many times people tell you   If you want a great career  you have to pursue your passion  you have to pursue your dreams  you have to pursue the greatest fascination in your life   you hear it again and again  and then you decide not to do it. It doesn't matter how many times you download Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address  you still look at it and decide not to do it. I'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it. You're too lazy to do it. It's too hard. You're afraid if you look for your passion and don't find it  you'll feel like you're an idiot  so then you make excuses about why you're not going to look for your passion. They are excuses  ladies and gentlemen. We're going to go through a whole long list    your creativity in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do if you want to have a great career. So  for example  one of your great excuses is   Well  great careers are really and truly  for most people  just a matter of luck. So I'm going to stand around  I'm going to try to be lucky  and if I'm lucky  I'll have a great career. If not  I'll have a good career.  But a good career is an impossibility  so that's not going to work. Then  your other excuse is   Yes  there are special people who pursue their passions  but they are geniuses. They are Steven J. I'm not a genius. When I was five  I thought I was a genius  but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since.   And now I know I am completely competent.  Now  you see  if this was       being completely competent    that would have given you a great career. But guess what  This is almost       and saying to the world   I am totally  completely competent   is damning yourself with the faintest of praise. And then  of course  another excuse   Well  I would do this  I would do this  but  but    well  after all  I'm not weird. Everybody knows that people who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive. A little strange. Hmm  Hmm  Okay  You know  a fine line between madness and genius.  I'm not weird. I've read Steven J.'s biography. Oh my goodness    I'm not that person. I am nice. I am normal. I'm a nice  normal person  and nice  normal people    don't have passion.   Ah  but I still want a great career. I'm not prepared to pursue my passion  so I know what I'm going to do  because I have a solution. I have a strategy. It's the one Mommy and Daddy told me about. Mommy and Daddy told me that if I worked hard  I'd have a good career. So  if you work hard and have a good career  if you work really  really  really hard  you'll have a great career. Doesn't that  like  mathematically make sense   Hmm. Not. But you've managed to talk yourself into that. You know what  Here's a little secret  You want to work  You want to work really  really  really hard  You know what  You'll succeed. The world will give you the opportunity to work really  really  really  really hard. But  are you so sure that that's going to give you a great career  when all the evidence is to the contrary  So let's deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion. You actually understand that you really had better do it  never mind the excuses. You're trying to find your passion    and you're so happy. You found something you're interested in.  I have an interest  I have an interest   You tell me. You say   I have an interest   I say   That's wonderful  And what are you trying to tell me    Well  I have an interest.  I say   Do you have passion    I have an interest   you say.  Your interest is compared to what    Well  I'm interested in this.   And what about the rest of humanity's activities    I'm not interested in them.   You've looked at them all  have you    No. Not exactly.  Passion is your greatest love. Passion is the thing that will help you create the highest expression of your talent. Passion  interest    it's not the same thing. Are you really going to go to your sweetie and say   Marry me  You're interesting.  Won't happen. Won't happen  and you will die alone. What you want  what you want  what you want  is passion. It is beyond interest. You need    interests  and then one of them  one of them might grab you  one of them might engage you more than anything else  and then you may have found your greatest love  in comparison to all the other things that interest you  and that's what passion is. I have a friend  proposed to his sweetie. He was an economically rational person. He said to his sweetie   Let us marry. Let us merge our interests.  Yes  he did.  I love you truly   he said.  I love you deeply. I love you more than any other woman I've ever encountered. I love you more than Mary  Jane  Susie  Penelope  Ingrid  Gertrude  Gretel    I was on a German exchange program then. I love you more than     All right. She left the room halfway through his enumeration of his love for her. After he got over his surprise at being  you know  turned down  he concluded he'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person. Although  he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed  it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part. But the point stands. You must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny  or are you afraid of the word  destiny   Does the word  destiny  scare you  That's what we're talking about. And if you don't find the highest expression of your talent  if you settle for  interesting   what the hell ever that means  do you know what will happen at the end of your long life  Your friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery  and there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone  and inscribed on that tombstone it will say   Here lies a distinguished engineer  who invented Velcro.  But what that tombstone should have said  in an alternative lifetime  what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent  was   Here lies the last Nobel Laureate in Physics  who formulated the Grand Unified Field Theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive.  Velcro  indeed  One was a great career. One was a missed opportunity. But then  there are some of you who  in spite of all these excuses  you will find  you will find your passion. And you'll still fail. You're going to fail  because    because you're not going to do it  because you will have invented a new excuse  any excuse to fail to take action  and this excuse  I've heard so many times   Yes  I would pursue a great career  but  I value human relationships    more than accomplishment. I want to be a great friend. I want to be a great spouse. I want to be a great parent  and I will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment.  What do you want me to say  Now  do you really want me to say now  tell you   Really  I swear I don't kick children.  Look at the worldview you've given yourself. You're a hero no matter what. And I  by suggesting ever so delicately that you might want a great career  must hate children. I don't hate children. I don't kick them. Yes  there was a little kid wandering through this building when I came here  and no  I didn't kick him. Course  I had to tell him the building was for adults only  and to get out. He mumbled something about his mother  and I told him she'd probably find him outside anyway. Last time I saw him  he was on the stairs crying. What a wimp. But what do you mean  That's what you expect me to say. Do you really think it's appropriate that you should actually take children and use them as a shield  You know what will happen someday  you ideal parent  you  The kid will come to you someday and say   I know what I want to be. I know what I'm going to do with my life.  You are so happy. It's the conversation a parent wants to hear  because your kid's good in math  and you know you're going to like what comes next. Says your kid   I have decided I want to be a magician. I want to perform magic tricks on the stage.  And what do you say  You say  you say   That's risky  kid. Might fail  kid. Don't make a lot of money at that  kid. I don't know  kid  you should think about that again  kid. You're so good at math  why don't you     The kid interrupts you and says   But it is my dream. It is my dream to do this.  And what are you going to say  You know what you're going to say   Look kid. I had a dream once  too  but    But     So how are you going to finish the sentence with your  but    But. I had a dream too  once  kid  but I was afraid to pursue it.  Or are you going to tell him this   I had a dream once  kid. But then  you were born.  Do you really want to use your family  do you really ever want to look at your spouse and your kid  and see your jailers  There was something you could have said to your kid  when he or she said   I have a dream.  You could have said    looked the kid in the face and said   Go for it  kid  Just like I did.  But you won't be able to say that  because you didn't. So you can't. And so the sins of the parents are visited on the poor children. Why will you seek refuge in human relationships as your excuse not to find and pursue your passion  You know why. In your heart of hearts  you know why  and I'm being deadly serious. You know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships. It is because you are    you know what you are. You're afraid to pursue your passion. You're afraid to look ridiculous. You're afraid to try. You're afraid you may fail. Great friend  great spouse  great parent  great career. Is that not a package  Is that not who you are  How can you be one without the other  But you're afraid. And that's why you're not going to have a great career. Unless     unless   that most evocative of all English words     unless.  But the  unless  word is also attached to that other  most terrifying phrase   If only I had ...   If only I had ...  If you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain  it will hurt a lot. So  those are the many reasons why you are going to fail to have a great career. Unless    Unless. Thank you. I have a question for you  Are you religious  Please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person. Let's see  I'd say about three or four percent. I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference. Okay  here's another question  Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way  shape or form  Raise your hand. Okay  that's the majority. My Talk today is about the main reason  or one of the main reasons  why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way  shape or form. My Talk today is about self transcendence. It's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away. And when that happens  the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings. We talk about being uplifted or elevated. Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor. So here's the metaphor I'm offering today. Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms  most of which we're very familiar with. But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase. We climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness. In       the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience. He collected all kinds of case studies. He quoted the words of all kinds of people who'd had a variety of these experiences. One of the most exciting to me is this young man  Stephen Bradley  had an encounter  he thought  with Jesus in     . And here's what Bradley said about it. for about one second in the room  with arms extended  appearing to say to me   Come.  The next day I rejoiced with trembling. My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die. This world had no place in my affections. Previous to this time  I was very selfish and self righteous. But now I desired the welfare of all mankind and could  with a feeling heart  forgive my worst enemies. JH  So note how Bradley's petty  moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase. And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving. The world's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase. Some shut down the self using meditation. Others use psychedelic drugs. This is from a   th century Aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god. Others use dancing  spinning and circling to promote self transcendence. But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase. Lots of people find self transcendence in nature. Others overcome their self at raves. But here's the weirdest place of all  war. So many books about war say the same thing  that nothing brings people together like war. And that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self transcendent experiences. I'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by Glenn Gray. Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II. And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle. Here's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase. that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives.  I  passes insensibly into a  we    my  becomes  our  and individual faith loses its central importance. I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy. I may fall  but I do not die  for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life. JH  So what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out  or melt away  and it feels good  it feels really good  in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives. It feels somehow uplifting. This idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim. Durkheim even called us Homo duplex  or two level man. The lower level he called the level of the profane. Now profane is the opposite of sacred. It just means ordinary or common. And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals. We want to satisfy our individual desires. We pursue our individual goals. But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change. Individuals unite into a team  a movement or a nation  which is far more than the sum of its parts. Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group  into a moral community. Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness. And once people circle around some sacred object or value  they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it. Durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum  of making a group out of individuals. Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended. Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square  which brought down a dictator. And think of the collective grief in the United States that we all felt  that brought us all together  after     . So let me summarize where we are. I'm saying that the capacity for self transcendence is just a basic part of being human. I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind. I'm saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred. When we climb that staircase  self interest fades away  we become just much less self interested  and we feel as though we are better  nobler and somehow uplifted. So here's the million dollar question for social scientists like me  Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design  Is it a product of natural selection  like our hands  Or is it a bug  a mistake in the system    this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain    Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience  it's just a mistake  Well many scientists who study religion take this view. The New Atheists  for example  argue that religion is a set of memes  sort of parasitic memes  that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff  self destructive stuff  like suicide bombing. And after all  how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves  How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self interest  Well let me show you. In  The Descent of Man   Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality    where did it come from  why do we have it. Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves  but they're of great use to our groups. He wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition. He said   If the one tribe included a great number of courageous  sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other  this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other.  He went on to say that  Selfish and contentious people will not cohere  and without coherence nothing can be effected.  In other words  Charles Darwin believed in group selection. Now this idea has been very controversial for the last    years  but it's about to make a major comeback this year  especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April  making a very strong case that we  and several other species  are products of group selection. But really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection. So look at it this way  You've got competition going on within groups and across groups. So here's a group of guys on a college crew team. Within this team there's competition. There are guys competing with each other. The slowest rowers  the weakest rowers  are going to get cut from the team. And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport. Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics. So within the team  their interests are actually pitted against each other. And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys. Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach. But while that competition is going on within the boat  this competition is going on across boats. And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat  now they've got no choice but to cooperate because they're all in the same boat. They can only win if they all pull together as a team. I mean  these things sound trite  but they are deep evolutionary truths. The main argument against group selection has always been that  well sure  it would be nice to have a group of cooperators  but as soon as you have a group of cooperators  they're just going to get taken over by free riders  individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others. Let me illustrate this for you. Suppose we've got a group of little organisms    they can be bacteria  they can be hamsters  it doesn't matter what    and let's suppose that this little group here  they evolved to be cooperative. Well that's great. They graze  they defend each other  they work together  they generate wealth. And as you'll see in this simulation  as they interact they gain points  as it were  they grow  and when they've doubled in size  you'll see them split  and that's how they reproduce and the population grows. But suppose then that one of them mutates. There's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy. It takes advantage of the others. And so when a green interacts with a blue  you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller. So here's how things play out. We start with just one green  and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food. And in short order  the cooperators are done for. The free riders have taken over. If a group cannot solve the free rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started. But there are solutions to the free rider problem. It's not that hard a problem. In fact  nature has solved it many  many times. And nature's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat. For example  why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA  totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus  It's because they used to be separate free living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism. Somehow or other    maybe one swallowed another  we'll never know exactly why    but once they got a membrane around them  they were all in the same membrane  now all the wealth created division of labor  all the greatness created by cooperation  stays locked inside the membrane and we've got a superorganism. And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free riders  of defectors  of cheaters and look what happens. A superorganism can basically take what it wants. It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens  from the defectors  the cheaters. And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms. What I've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history. Darwin's laws don't change  but now there's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different. Now this transition was not a one time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria. It happened again about     or a     million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple  primitive nests  or hives. Once several wasps were all together in the same hive  they had no choice but to cooperate  because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives. And the most cohesive hives won  just as Darwin said. These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere. And it happened again  even more spectacularly  in the last half million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures  they came together around a hearth or a campfire  they divided labor  they began painting their bodies  they spoke their own dialects  and eventually they worshiped their own gods. Once they were all in the same tribe  they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside. And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet  which is human cooperation    a force for construction and destruction. Of course  human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives. Human groups may look like hives for brief moments  but they tend to then break apart. We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are. In fact  often  as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts  often those divisions are along religious lines. Nonetheless  when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement  they can move mountains. Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you. Do you think they're there pursuing their self interest  Or are they pursuing communal interest  which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole  Okay  so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way. And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again in three minutes in a more full spectrum sort of way. of religious experience  as William James explained. One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves. The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred  or deeply interconnected. We are Homo duplex  as Durkheim explained. And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection  as Darwin explained. I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug  but if it is an adaptation  then the implications are profound. If it is an adaptation  then we evolved to be religious. I don't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions. Those things came along too recently. I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects  people and ideas. This is why politics is so tribal. Politics is partly profane  it's partly about self interest  but politics is also about sacredness. It's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas. It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil  and we all believe we're on the good team. And most importantly  if the staircase is real  it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life. Because human beings are  to some extent  hivish creatures like bees. We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment. We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed. We unleashed Earth changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort. Nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom. But sometimes we wonder  Is this all there is  What should I do with my life  What's missing  What's missing is that we are Homo duplex  but modern  secular society was built to satisfy our lower  profane selves. It's really comfortable down here on the lower level. Come  have a seat in my home entertainment center. One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top. I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia. They all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into. They're all searching for their staircase. And that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish. Most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger. And this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly     years ago.  No man is an island entire of itself. Every man is a piece of the continent  a part of the main.  JH  Thank you. The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been very emotional. And I think some dispassionate  quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate. I'd therefore like to propose that we employ  we enlist  the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject. For instance  just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses    billion dollars a year to copyright theft. Now rather than just argue about this number  a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin  and then to Mars ... ... if we use pennies. Now this is obviously a powerful  some might say dangerously powerful  insight. But it's also a morally important one. Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about  but this is actual economic losses. This is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops  as well as wheat  tobacco  rice  sorghum    whatever sorghum is    losing sorghum. But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math. Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since Napster first came on the scene. So that's a chunk of what we're looking for. But total movie revenues across theaters  home video and pay per view are up. And TV  satellite and cable revenues are way up. Other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up. So this small missing chunk here is puzzling. Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms  it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented  but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms    one that didn't exist in the   's. What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.    billion dollars of it a year  which is enough  at    seconds a ringtone  that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times. It's true. I have Excel. The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over         jobs to content theft  which is quite a lot when you consider that  back in '    the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing         people. Other data has the music industry at about        people. And so the job losses that came with the Internet and all that content theft  have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries. And this is just one of the many mind blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day. And some people think that string theory is tough. Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit. It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated. Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law. Some people think this number's a little bit large  but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year. Now when this law first passed  the world's hottest MP  player could hold just    songs. And it was a big Christmas hit. Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks worth of stolen goods in his pocket. These days an iPod Classic can hold        songs  which is to say eight billion dollars worth of stolen media. Or about        jobs. Now you might find copyright math strange  but that's because it's a field that's best left to experts. So that's it for now. I hope you'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk. I woke up the morning after I gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life. And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days. The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch. And when I walked in  she was already at the table. I sat down  and she said   God  you look like hell.  I said   Thanks. I feel really    I'm not functioning.  And she said   What's going on   And I said   I just told     people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability. And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data  as absolutely essential to whole hearted living  I told these     people that I had a breakdown. I had a slide that said 'Breakdown.' At what point did I think that was a good idea   And she said   I saw your talk live streamed. It was not really you. It was a little different than what you usually do. But it was great.  And I said   This can't happen. YouTube  they're putting this thing on YouTube. And we're going to be talking about          people.  And she said   Well  I think it's too late.  And I said   Let me ask you something.  And she said   Yeah.  I said   Do you remember when we were in college  really wild and kind of dumb   She said   Yeah.  I said   Remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex boyfriend's answering machine  Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape   And she goes   Uh... no.  Of course  the only thing I could say at that point was   Yeah  me neither. Yeah    me neither.  And I'm thinking to myself   Bren   what are you doing  Why did you bring this up  Have you lost your mind  Your sisters would be perfect for this.  So I looked back up and she said   Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube   And I said   I'm just thinking about it a little bit.  She said   You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever.  Then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic  but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.  If     turns into       or        my life is over.  I had no contingency plan for four million. And my life did end when that happened. And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself  and that was that  as much as I would be frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world  there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small  staying right under the radar. But I want to talk about what I've learned. There's two things that I've learned in the last year. The first is  vulnerability is not weakness. And that myth is profoundly dangerous. Let me ask you honestly    and I'll give you this warning  I'm trained as a therapist  so I can out wait you uncomfortably    so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome    how many of you honestly  when you're thinking about doing or saying something vulnerable think   God  vulnerability is weakness.  How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously  The majority of people. Now let me ask you this question  This past week at TED  how many of you  when you saw vulnerability up here  thought it was pure courage  Vulnerability is not weakness. I define vulnerability as emotional risk  exposure  uncertainty. It fuels our daily lives. And I've come to the belief    this is my   th year doing this research    that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage    to be vulnerable  to let ourselves be seen  to be honest. One of the weird things that's happened is  after the TED explosion  I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country    everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune     companies. And so many of the calls went like this   Dr. Brown  we loved your TED talk. We'd like you to come in and speak. We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame.  What would you like for me to talk about  There's three big answers. This is mostly  to be honest with you  from the business sector  innovation  creativity and change. So let me go on the record and say  vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation  creativity and change. To create is to make something that has never existed before. There's nothing more vulnerable than that. Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability. The second thing  in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage  the second thing I learned  is this  We have to talk about shame. And I'm going to be really honest with you. When I became a  vulnerability researcher  and that became the focus because of the TED talk    and I'm not kidding. I'll give you an example. About three months ago  I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store. About from a hundred feet away  this is what I hear   Vulnerability TED  Vulnerability TED   I'm a fifth generation Texan. Our family motto is  Lock and load.  I am not a natural vulnerability researcher. So I'm like  just keep walking  she's on my six. And then I hear   Vulnerability TED   I turn around  I go   Hi.  She's right here and she said   You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown.  At this point  parents are  like  pulling their children close.  Look away.  And I'm so worn out at this point in my life  I look at her and I actually say   It was a fricking spiritual awakening.  And she looks back and does this   I know.  And she said   We watched your TED talk in my book club. Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'The Breakdown Babes.'  And she said   Our tagline is  'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'  You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting. So when I became Vulnerability TED  like an action figure    Like Ninja Barbie  but I'm Vulnerability TED    I thought  I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind  because I spent six years studying shame before I started writing and talking about vulnerability. And I thought  thank God  because shame is this horrible topic  no one wants to talk about it. It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.  What do you do    I study shame.   Oh.  And I see you. But in surviving this last year  I was reminded of a cardinal rule    not a research rule  but a moral imperative from my upbringing     you've got to dance with the one who brung ya . And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability. I learned about these things from studying shame. And so I want to walk you in to shame. Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul. And we're going to walk in. And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there. It is to put on some galoshes    and walk through and find our way around. Here's why. We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country  and I think globally  around race  right  Yes  We heard that. Yes  Cannot have that conversation without shame. Because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege. And when people start talking about privilege  they get paralyzed by shame. We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery  which is  have a checklist. You can't fix that problem without addressing shame  because when they teach those folks how to suture  they also teach them how to stitch their self worth to being all powerful. And all powerful folks don't need checklists. And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn't mess it up here. Myshkin Ingawale  I hope I did right by you. I saw the TED Fellows my first day here. And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia  because people were dying unnecessarily. And he said   I saw this need. So you know what I did  I made it.  And everybody just burst into applause  and they were like  Yes   And he said   And it didn't work. And then I made it    more times  and then it worked.  You know what the big secret about TED is  I can't wait to tell people this. I guess I'm doing it right now. This is like the failure conference. No  it is. You know why this place is amazing  Because very few people here are afraid to fail. And no one who gets on the stage  so far that I've seen  has not failed. I've failed miserably  many times. I don't think the world understands that  because of shame. There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt. A lot of people refer to it as the  Man in the Arena  quote. And it goes like this   It is not the critic who counts. It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles. The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat. But when he's in the arena  at best  he wins  and at worst  he loses  but when he fails  when he loses  he does so daring greatly.  And that's what this conference  to me  is about. Life is about daring greatly  about being in the arena. When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door  and you think   I'm going in and I'm going to try this   shame is the gremlin who says   Uh  uh. You're not good enough. You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you. I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg  he was in Sing Sing. I know those things that happened to you growing up. I know you don't think that you're pretty  smart  talented or powerful enough. I know your dad never paid attention  even when you made CFO.  Shame is that thing. And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say   I'm going to do this   we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing     percent of the time is who  Us. Shame drives two big tapes     never good enough     and  if you can talk it out of that one   who do you think you are   The thing to understand about shame is  it's not guilt. Shame is a focus on self  guilt is a focus on behavior. Shame is  I am bad.  Guilt is  I did something bad.  How many of you  if you did something that was hurtful to me  would be willing to say   I'm sorry. I made a mistake   How many of you would be willing to say that  Guilt  I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Shame  I'm sorry. I am a mistake. There's a huge difference between shame and guilt. And here's what you need to know. Shame is highly  highly correlated with addiction  depression  violence  aggression  bullying  suicide  eating disorders. And here's what you even need to know more. Guilt  inversely correlated with those things. The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive. It's uncomfortable  but it's adaptive. The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender. If shame washes over me and washes over Chris  it's going to feel the same. Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame. We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy. Which means  yes  I have a little shame  no  I'm a sociopath. So I would opt for  yes  you have a little shame. Shame feels the same for men and women  but it's organized by gender. For women  the best example I can give you is Enjoli  the commercial.  I can put the wash on the line  pack the lunches  hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine. I can bring home the bacon  fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man.  For women  shame is  do it all  do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat. I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold  but I guarantee you  it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. Shame  for women  is this web of unobtainable  conflicting  competing expectations about who we're supposed to be. And it's a straight jacket. For men  shame is not a bunch of competing  conflicting expectations. Shame is one  do not be perceived as what  Weak. I did not interview men for the first four years of my study. It wasn't until a man looked at me after a book signing  and said   I love what say about shame  I'm curious why you didn't mention men.  And I said   I don't study men.  And he said   That's convenient.  And I said   Why   And he said   Because you say to reach out  tell our story  be vulnerable. But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters   I said   Yeah.   They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down. When we reach out and be vulnerable  we get the shit beat out of us. And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads. Because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else.  So I started interviewing men and asking questions. And what I learned is this  You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear  I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work. You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it  she can't do it all anymore  and his first response is not   I unloaded the dishwasher   But he really listens    because that's all we need    I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work. Shame is an epidemic in our culture. And to get out from underneath it    to find our way back to each other  we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting  the way we're working  the way we're looking at each other. Very quickly  some research by Mahalik at Boston College. He asked  what do women need to do to conform to female norms  The top answers in this country  nice  thin  modest and use all available resources for appearance. When he asked about men  what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms  the answers were  always show emotional control  work is first  pursue status and violence. If we're going to find our way back to each other  we have to understand and know empathy  because empathy's the antidote to shame. If you put shame in a Petri dish  it needs three things to grow exponentially  secrecy  silence and judgment. If you put the same amount in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy  it can't survive. The two most powerful words when we're in struggle  me too. And so I'll leave you with this thought. If we're going to find our way back to each other  vulnerability is going to be that path. And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena  because I think I did it my whole life  and think to myself  I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect. And that is seductive. But the truth is  that never happens. And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there  that's not what we want to see. We want you to go in. We want to be with you and across from you. And we just want  for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with  to dare greatly. So thank you all very much. I really appreciate it. I'm a believer. I'm a believer in global warming  and my record is good on the subject. But my subject is national security. We have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy. I'm talking about OPEC oil. And let me take you back     years to     . You're probably thinking that was my birth year. It wasn't. It was     . But go back to           years ago  and look at that point what we  our country  was faced with. It's the same energy question that you're looking at today  but it's different sources of fuel. A hundred years ago we were looking at coal  of course  and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil. At that point  we were looking for a fuel that was cleaner  it was cheaper  and it wasn't ours though  it was theirs. So at that point        we selected crude oil over whale oil and some more coal. But as we moved on to the period now      years later  we're back really at another decision point. What is the decision point  It's what we're going to use in the future. So from here  it's pretty clear to me  we would prefer to have cleaner  cheaper  domestic  ours    and we have that  we have that    which is natural gas. So here you are  that the cost of all this to the world is    million barrels of oil  give or take a few barrels  every day. And the cost annually is three trillion dollars. And one trillion of that goes to OPEC. That has got to be stopped. Now if you look at the cost of OPEC  it cost seven trillion dollars    on the Milken Institute study last year    seven trillion dollars since       is what we paid for oil from OPEC. Now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both. But it's the greatest transfer of wealth  from one group to another in the history of mankind. And it continues. Now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth  you can see here that we have the arrows going into the Mid East and away from us. And with that  we have found ourselves to be the world's policemen. We are policing the world  and how are we doing that  I know the response to this. I would bet there aren't    percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world. Raise your hand if you think you know. There are   . One is under construction by the Chinese and the other    belong to us. Why do we have    aircraft carriers  Do we have a corner on the market  Are we smarter than anybody else  I'm not sure. If you look at where they're located    and on this slide it's the red blobs on there    there are five that are operating in the Mid East  and the rest of them are in the United States. They just move back to the Mid East and those come back. So actually most of the    we have are tied up in the Mid East. Why  Why are they in the Mid East  They're there to control  keep the shipping lanes open and make oil available. And the United States uses about    million barrels a day  which is about    percent of all the oil used everyday in the world. And we're doing it with four percent of the population. Somehow that doesn't seem right. That's not sustainable. So where do we go from here  Does that continue  Yes  it's going to continue. The slide you're looking at here is      to     . Over that period you are going to double your demand. And when you look at what we're using the oil for     percent of it is used for transportation fuel. So when somebody says   Let's go more nuclear  let's go wind  let's go solar   fine  I'm for anything American  anything American. But if you're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil  you have to address transportation. So here we are using    million barrels a day    producing eight  importing     and from the     five comes from OPEC. When you look at the biggest user and the second largest user  we use    million barrels and the Chinese use   . The Chinese have a little bit better plan    or they have a plan  we have no plan. In the history of America  we've never had an energy plan. We don't even realize the resources that we have available to us. If you take the last    years and bring forward  you've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars. If you go forward the next    years and cap the price of oil at     dollars a barrel  you will pay  .  trillion. That's not sustainable either. But the days of cheap oil are over. They're over. They make it very clear to you  the Saudis do  they have to have    dollars a barrel to make their social commitments. Now I had people in Washington last week told me  he said   The Saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel. That has nothing to do with it. It's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil.  There is no free market for oil. The oil is priced off the margin. And the OPEC nations are the ones that price the oil. So where are we headed from here  We're headed to natural gas. Natural gas will do everything we want it to do. It's     octane fuel. It's    percent cleaner than oil. It's ours  we have an abundance of it. And it does not require a refinery. It comes out of the ground at     octane. Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it. It's going to be very simple for us to use. It's going to be simple to accomplish this. You're going to find  and I'll tell you in just a minute  what you're looking for to make it happen. But here you can look at the list. Natural gas will fit all of those. It will replace or be able to be used for that. It's for power generation  transportation  it's peaking fuel  it's all those. Do we have enough natural gas  Look at the bar on the left. It's    trillion. It's what we use a year. Go forward and the estimates that you have from the EIA and onto the industry estimates    the industry knows what they're talking about    we've got       trillion cubic feet of natural gas that's available to us. How does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent  It would be three times what the Saudis claim they have. And they claim they have     billion barrels of oil  which I do not believe. I think it's probably     billion barrels. But anyway  whether they say they're right or whatever  we have plenty of natural gas. So I have tried to target on where we use the natural gas. And where I've targeted is on the heavy duty trucks. There are eight million of them. You take eight million trucks    these are    wheelers    and take them to natural gas  reduce carbon by    percent  it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels. So you will cut    percent off of OPEC with eight million trucks. There are     million vehicles in America. So what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel  is the way I see it. I don't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age. That's your concern. But when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas  because you have plenty of natural gas. But as I said  I'm for anything American. Now let me take you    I've been a realist    I went from theorist early to realist. I'm back to theorist again. If you look at the world  you have methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent. And here you can see methane  if that's the way you're going to go  that there's plenty of methane    natural gas is methane  methane and natural gas are interchangeable    but if you decide that you're going to use some methane    and I'm gone  so it's up to you    but we do have plenty of methane hydrates. So I think I've made my point that we have to get on our own resources in America. If we do    it's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil. And yet  we have no energy plan. So there's nothing going on that impresses me in Washington on that plan  other than I'm trying to focus on that eight million    wheelers. If we could do that  I think we would take our first step to an energy plan. If we did  we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thanks for that. So from your point of view  you had this great Pickens Plan that was based on wind energy  and you abandoned it basically because the economics changed. What happened  TBP  I lost     million dollars. That'll make you abandon something. No  what happened to us  Chris  is that power  it's priced off the margin. And so the margin is natural gas. And at the time I went into the wind business  natural gas was nine dollars. Today it's two dollars and forty cents. You cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an MCF. CA  So what happened was that  through increased ability to use fracking technology  the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded and the price plummeted  which made wind uncompetitive. In a nutshell that's what happened  TBP  That's what happened. We found out that we could go to the source rock  which were the carboniferous shales in the basins. The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast across New York  Pennsylvania  West Virginia  and Haynesville in Louisiana. This stuff is everywhere. We are overwhelmed with natural gas. CA  And now you're a big investor in that and bringing that to market  TBP  Well you say a big investor. It's my life. I'm a geologist  got out of school in '    and I've been in the industry my entire life. Now I do own stocks. I'm not a big natural gas producer. Somebody the other day said I was the second largest natural gas producer in the United States. Don't I wish. But no  I'm not. I own stocks. But I also am in the fueling business. CA  But natural gas is a fossil fuel. You burn it  you release CO . So you believe in the threat of climate change. Why doesn't that prospect concern you  TBP  Well you're going to have to use something. What do you have to replace it  CA  No  no. The argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense  because the amount of CO  per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal  correct  And so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas. But if that's it and that becomes the reason that renewables don't get invested in  then  long term  we're screwed anyway  right  TBP  Well I'm not ready to give up  but Jim and I talked there as he left  and I said   How do you feel about natural gas   And he said   Well it's a bridge fuel  is what it is.  And I said   Bridge to what  Where are we headed   See but again  I told you  I don't have to worry with that. You all do. CA  But I don't think that's right  Boone. I think you're a person who believes in your legacy. You've made the money you need. You're one of the few people in a position to really swing the debate. Do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon  Does that make sense  TBP  I don't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program. I can tell you it will be a failure. The government is not successful on these things. They just aren't  it's a bad deal. Look at Solyndra  or whatever it was. I mean  that was told to be a bad idea    times  they went ahead and did it anyway. But that only blew out     million. I think it's closer to a billion. But Chris  I think where we're headed  the long term  I don't mind going back to nuclear. And I can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be. One  don't build a reformer on a fault. And number two  do not build a reformer on the ocean. And now I think reformers are safe. Move them inland and on very stable ground and build the reformers. There isn't anything wrong with nuke. You're going to have to have energy. There is no question. You can't    okay. CA  One of the questions from the audience is  with fracking and the natural gas process  what about the problem of methane leaking from that  methane being a worse global warming gas than CO   Is that a concern  TBP  Fracking  What is fracking  CA  Fracking. TBP  I'm teasing. CA  We've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here  you know. TBP  No  let me tell you  I've told you what my age was. I got out of school in '  . I witnessed my first frack job at border Texas in     . Fracking came out in '    and don't believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the Department of Energy    years ago developed fracking. I don't know what in the hell he's talking about. I mean seriously  the Department of Energy did not have anything to do with fracking. The first frack job was in '  . I saw my first one in '  . I've fracked over       wells in my life. Never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else. Now the largest aquifer in North America is from Midland  Texas to the South Dakota border  across eight states    big aquifer  Ogallala  Triassic age. There had to have been         wells fracked in Oklahoma  Texas  Kansas in that aquifer. There's no problems. I don't understand why the media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania. CA  All right  so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon. Your picture then I guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately  that we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive  TBP  Solar and wind  Jim and I agreed on that in    seconds. That is  it's going to be a small part  because you can't rely on it. CA  So how does the world get off fossil fuels  TBP  How do we get there  We have so much natural gas  a day will not come where you say   Well let's don't use that anymore.  You'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all. And if you look at California  they use       buses. LAMTA have been on natural gas for    years. The Ft. Worth T has been on it for    years. Why  Air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel. Why are all the trash trucks today in Southern California on natural gas  It's because of air quality. I know what you're telling me  and I'm not disagreeing with you. How in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point  And I say  that is your problem. CA  All right  so it's the bridge fuel. What is at the other end of that bridge is for this audience to figure out. If someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution  are you ready to invest in those technologies  even if they aren't maximized for profits  they might be maximized for the future health of the planet  TBP  I lost     million on the wind  okay. Yeah  sure  I'm game for it. Because  again  I'm trying to get energy solved for America. And anything American will work for me. CA  Boone  I really  really appreciate you coming here  engaging in this conversation. I think there's a lot of people who will want to engage with you. And that was a real gift you gave this audience. Thank you so much.  TBP  You bet  Chris. Thank you.  One out of two of you women will be impacted by cardiovascular disease in your lifetime. So this is the leading killer of women. It's a closely held secret for reasons I don't know. In addition to making this personal    so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart and all women's relationship with their heart    we're going to wax into the politics. Because the personal  as you know  is political. And not enough is being done about this. And as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign  this is what we need to do now with heart. Since       more women die in the U.S. than men. So where we used to think of heart disease as being a man's problem primarily    which that was never true  but that was kind of how everybody thought in the     s and '  s  and it was in all the textbooks. It's certainly what I learned when I was training. If we were to remain sexist  and that was not right  but if we were going to go forward and be sexist  it's actually a woman's disease. So it's a woman's disease now. And one of the things that you see is that male line  the mortality is going down  down  down  down  down. And you see the female line since       the gap is widening. More and more women  two  three  four times more women  dying of heart disease than men. And that's too short of a time period for all the different risk factors that we know to change. So what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies  which had been developed in men  by men  for men for the last    years    and they work pretty well in men  don't they     weren't working so well for women. So that was a big wake up call in the     's. Heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer. And the breast cancer campaign    again  this is not a competition. We're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign. We need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis. Now sometimes when people see this  I hear this gasp. We can all think of someone  often a young woman  who has been impacted by breast cancer. We often can't think of a young woman who has heart disease. I'm going to tell you why. Heart disease kills people  often very quickly. So the first time heart disease strikes in women and men  half of the time it's sudden cardiac death    no opportunity to say good bye  no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy  no opportunity to help her pick out a wig. Breast cancer  mortality is down to four percent. And that is the    years that women have advocated. Betty Ford  Nancy Reagan stood up and said   I'm a breast cancer survivor   and it was okay to talk about it. And then physicians have gone to bat. We've done the research. We have effective therapies now. Women are living longer than ever. That has to happen in heart disease  and it's time. It's not happening  and it's time. We owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women. As Barbara depicted in one of her amazing movies   Yentl   she portrayed a young woman who wanted an education. And she wanted to study the Talmud. And so how did she get educated then  She had to impersonate a man. She had to look like a man. She had to make other people believe that she looked like a man and she could have the same rights that the men had. Bernadine Healy  Dr. Healy  was a cardiologist. And right around that time  in the     's  that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up  up  up  up  up  she wrote an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine and said  the Yentl syndrome. Women are dying of heart disease  two  three  four times more than men. Mortality is not going down  it's going up. And she questioned  she hypothesized  is this a Yentl syndrome  And here's what the story is. Is it because women don't look like men  they don't look like that male pattern heart disease that we've spent the last    years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics  and therefore  they're not recognized for their heart disease. And they're just passed. They don't get treated  they don't get detected  they don't get the benefit of all the modern medicines. Doctor Healy then subsequently became the first female director of our National Institutes of Health. And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research in the world. And it funds a lot of my research. It funds research all over the place. It was a very big deal for her to become director. And she started  in the face of a lot of controversy  the Women's Health Initiative. And every woman in the room here has benefited from that Women's Health Initiative. It told us about hormone replacement therapy. It's informed us about osteoporosis. It informed us about breast cancer  colon cancer in women. So a tremendous fund of knowledge despite  again  that so many people told her not to do it  it was too expensive. And the under reading was women aren't worth it. She was like   Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it.  Well there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative that went to National Heart  Lung  and Blood Institute  which is the cardiology part of the NIH. And we got to do the WISE study    and the WISE stands for Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation    and I have chaired this study for the last    years. It was a study to specifically ask  what's going on with women  Why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease  So in the WISE     years ago  we started out and said   Well wow  there's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that.  And our colleagues in Washington  D.C. had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die  compared to men who have heart attacks and die    and again  this is millions of people  happening every day    women  in their fatty plaque    and this is their coronary artery  so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle    women erode  men explode. You're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology. So I'll describe the male pattern heart attack first. Hollywood heart attack. Ughhhh. Horrible chest pain. EKG goes pbbrrhh  so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG. There's a big clot in the middle of the artery. And they go up to the cath lab and boom  boom  boom get rid of the clot. That's a man heart attack. Some women have those heart attacks  but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack  where it erodes  doesn't completely fill with clot  symptoms are subtle  EKG findings are different    female pattern. So what do you think happens to these gals  They're often not recognized  sent home. I'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas. So we picked up on that and we said   You know  we now have the ability to look inside human beings with these special catheters called IVUS  intravascular ultrasound.  And we said   We're going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is actually probably different  and deposited differently  than men.  And because of the common knowledge of how women and men get fat. When we watch people become obese  where do men get fat  Right here  it's just a focal    right there. Where do women get fat  All over. Cellulite here  cellulite here. So we said   Look  women look like they're pretty good about putting kind of the garbage away  smoothly putting it away. Men just have to dump it in a single area.  So we said   Let's look at these.  And so the yellow is the fatty plaque  and panel A is a man. And you can see  it's lumpy bumpy. He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries. Panel B is the woman  very smooth. She's just laid it down nice and tidy. And if you did that angiogram  which is the red  you can see the man's disease. So    years of honing and crafting these angiograms  we easily recognize male pattern disease. Kind of hard to see that female pattern disease. So that was a discovery. Now what are the implications of that  Well once again  women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem. So we are working now on a non invasive    again  these are all invasive studies. Ideally you would love to do all this non invasively. And again     years of good non invasive stress testing  we're pretty good at recognizing male pattern disease with stress tests. So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We're doing this at the Cedars Sinai Heart Institute in the Women's Heart Center. We selected this for the research. This is not in your community hospital  but we would hope to translate this. And we're about two and a half years into a five year study. This was the only modality that can see the inner lining of the heart. And if you look carefully  you can see that there's a black blush right there. And that is microvascular obstruction. The syndrome  the female pattern now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction  or obstruction. The second reason we really liked MRI is that there's no radiation. So unlike the CAT scans  X rays  thalliums  for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart  every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation  we say   Do we really need that test   So we're very excited about M.R. You can't go and order it yet  but this is an area of active inquiry where actually studying women is going to advance the field for women and men. What are the downstream consequences then  when female pattern heart disease is not recognized  This is a figure from an editorial that I published in the European Heart Journal this last summer. And it was just a pictogram to sort of show why more women are dying of heart disease  despite these good treatments that we know and we have work. And when the woman has male pattern disease    so she looks like Barbara in the movie    they get treated. And when you have female pattern and you look like a woman  as Barbara does here with her husband  they don't get the treatment. These are our life saving treatments. And those little red boxes are deaths. So those are the consequences. And that is female pattern and why we think the Yentl syndrome actually is explaining a lot of these gaps. There's been wonderful news also about studying women  finally  in heart disease. And one of the the cutting edge areas that we're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy. If you ask  what is the big difference between women and men physiologically  Why are there women and men  Because women bring new life into the world. That's all stem cells. So we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better at identifying the injury  doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs  which is one of the things that we're trying to do with stem cell therapy. These are female and male stem cells. And if you had an injured organ  if you had a heart attack and we wanted to repair that injured area  do you want those robust  plentiful stem cells on the top  Or do you want these guys  that look like they're out to lunch  And some of our investigative teams have demonstrated that female stem cells    and this is in animals and increasingly we're showing this in humans    that female stem cells  when put even into a male body  do better than male stem cells going into a male body. One of the things that we say about all of this female physiology    because again  as much as we're talking about women and heart disease  women do  on average  have better longevity than men    is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women. So this is not a zero sum game in anyway. Okay  so here's where we started. And remember  paths crossed in       and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease. What has happened in the last    years with this work  We are bending the curve. We're bending the curve. So just like the breast cancer story  doing research  getting awareness going  it works  you just have to get it going. Now are we happy with this  We still have two to three more women dying for every man. And I would propose  with the better longevity that women have overall  that women probably should theoretically do better  if we could just get treated. So this is where we are  but we have a long row to hoe. We've worked on this for    years. And I've told you  we've been working on male pattern heart disease for    years. So we're    years behind. And we'd like to think it's not going to take    years. And in fact  it probably won't. But we cannot stop now. Too many lives are at stake. So what do we need to do  You now  hopefully  have a more personal relationship with your heart. Women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns. The women are very good about getting mammograms now. And women do fundraising. Women participate. They have put their money where their mouth is and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns. This is what we need to do with heart disease now. And it's political. Women's health  from a federal funding standpoint  sometimes it's popular  sometimes it's not so popular. So we have these feast and famine cycles. So I implore you to join the Red Dress Campaign in this fundraising. Breast cancer  as we said  kills women  but heart disease kills a whole bunch more. So if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge  we have a lot of lives to save. So thank you for your attention. So my name is Taylor Wilson. I am    years old and I am a nuclear physicist  which may be a little hard to believe  but I am. And I would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point  that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about will get us to. So nuclear fusion is our energy future. And the second point  making the case that kids can really change the world. So you may ask    You may ask me  well how do you know what our energy future is  Well I built a fusion reactor when I was    years old. That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor. I started building this project when I was about    or    years old. I decided I wanted to make a star. Now most of you are probably saying  well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion. I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy. Well it doesn't break even. It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in  but it still does some pretty cool stuff. And I assembled this in my garage  and it now lives in the physics department of the University of Nevada  Reno. And it slams together deuterium  which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it. So this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun. And I'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together  and in the process it has some byproducts  and I utilize those byproducts. So this previous year  I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has. For hundreds of dollars  I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars. I built this in my garage. And I've developed a system to produce medical isotopes. Instead of requiring multi million dollar facilities I've developed a device that  on a very small scale  can produce these isotopes. So that's my fusion reactor in the background there. That is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor. Oh  by the way  I make yellowcake in my garage  so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians. So maybe I don't want to admit to that. This is me at CERN in Geneva  Switzerland  which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world. And this is me with President Obama  showing him my Homeland Security research. So in about seven years of doing nuclear research  I started out with a dream to make a  star in a jar   a star in my garage  and I ended up meeting the president and developing things that I think can change the world  and I think other kids can too. So thank you very much. I'm here to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry. And the way I'm going to do that is present to you five animations of five of my poems. And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about. Because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act. But when I was United States Poet Laureate    and I love saying that. It's a great way to start sentences. When I was him back then  I was approached by J. Walter Thompson  the ad company  and they were hired sort of by the Sundance Channel. And the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them. And I was initially resistant  because I always think poetry can stand alone by itself. Attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results  in all cases. And the poem  if it's written with the ear  already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed. And surely  if you're reading a poem that mentions a cow  you don't need on the facing page a drawing of a cow. I mean  let's let the reader do a little work. But I relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility  and also I'm like a total cartoon junkie since childhood. I think more influential than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth on my imagination were Warner Brothers  Merrie Melodies and Loony Tunes cartoons. Bugs Bunny is my muse. And this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places. And I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places    poetry on buses  poetry on subways  on billboards  on cereal boxes. When I was Poet Laureate  there I go again    I can't help it  it's true    I created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines that lasted for a couple of years. So you could tune into poetry as you were flying. And my sense is  it's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life. Start a meeting with a poem. That would be an idea you might take with you. When you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever  it happens to you so suddenly that you don't have time to deploy your anti poetry deflector shields that were installed in high school. So let us start with the first one. It's a little poem called  Budapest   and in it I reveal  or pretend to reveal  the secrets of the creative process. My pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sleeve of a loose green sweater. I watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly  intent as any forager that has nothing on its mind but the grubs and insects that will allow it to live another day. It wants only to be here tomorrow  dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt  nose pressed against the page  writing a few more dutiful lines while I gaze out the window and imagine Budapest or some other city where I have never been. BC  So that makes it seem a little easier. Writing is not actually as easy as that for me. But I like to pretend that it comes with ease. One of my students came up after class  an introductory class  and she said   You know  poetry is harder than writing   which I found both erroneous and profound. So I like to at least pretend it just flows out. A friend of mine has a slogan  he's another poet. He says that   If at first you don't succeed  hide all evidence you ever tried.  The next poem is also rather short. Poetry just says a few things in different ways. And I think you could boil this poem down to saying   Some days you eat the bear  other days the bear eats you.  And it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture. Some days I put the people in their places at the table  bend their legs at the knees  if they come with that feature  and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs. All afternoon they face one another  the man in the brown suit  the woman in the blue dress    perfectly motionless  perfectly behaved. But other days I am the one who is lifted up by the ribs then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse to sit with the others at the long table. Very funny. But how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next if you were going to spend it striding around like a vivid god  your shoulders in the clouds  or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper staring straight ahead with your little plastic face  BC  There's a horror movie in there somewhere. The next poem is called forgetfulness  and it's really just a kind of poetic essay on the subject of mental slippage. And the poem begins with a certain species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia  in other words  forgetting the things that you have read. The name of the author is the first to go  followed obediently by the title  the plot  the heartbreaking conclusion  the entire novel  which suddenly becomes one you have never read  never even heard of. It is as if  one by one  the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones. Long ago  you kissed the names of the nine muses good bye and you watched the quadratic equation pack its bag. And even now  as you memorize the order of the planets  something else is slipping away  a state flower perhaps  the address of an uncle  the capital of Paraguay. Whatever it is you are struggling to remember  it is not poised on the tip of your tongue  not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen. It has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall  well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim and how to ride a bicycle. No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war. No wonder the Moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart. BC  The next poem is called  The Country  and it's based on  when I was in college I met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine. He lived  and still does  in rural Vermont. I lived in New York City. And we would visit each other. And when I would go up to the country  he would teach me things like deer hunting  which meant getting lost with a gun basically    and trout fishing and stuff like that. And then he'd come down to New York City and I'd teach him what I knew  which was largely smoking and drinking. And in that way we traded lore with each other. The poem that's coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that I had a very hard time  at first  processing. It's called  The Country.  I wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike anywhere matches just lying around the house  because the mice might get into them and start a fire. But your face was absolutely straight when you twisted the lid down on the round tin where the matches  you said  are always stowed. Who could sleep that night  Who could whisk away the thought of the one unlikely mouse padding along a cold water pipe behind the floral wallpaper  gripping a single wooden match between the needles of his teeth  Who could not see him rounding a corner  the blue tip scratching against rough hewn beam  the sudden flare and the creature  for one bright  shining moment  suddenly thrust ahead of his time    now a fire starter  now a torch bearer in a forgotten ritual  little brown druid illuminating some ancient night  And who could fail to notice  lit up in the blazing insulation  the tiny looks of wonderment on the faces of his fellow mice    one time inhabitants of what once was your house in the country  BC  Thank you. Thank you. And the last poem is called  The Dead.  I wrote this after a friend's funeral  but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying  as all eulogists tend to do  which is how happy the deceased would be to look down and see all of us assembled. And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife  having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified. So the little poem is called  The Dead.  The dead are always looking down on us  they say. While we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich  they are looking down through the glass bottom boats of heaven as they row themselves slowly through eternity. They watch the tops of our heads moving below on Earth. And when we lie down in a field or on a couch  drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon  they think we are looking back at them  which makes them lift their oars and fall silent and wait like parents for us to close our eyes. BC  I'm not sure if other poems will be animated. It took a long time    I mean  it's rather uncommon to have this marriage    a long time to put those two together. But then again  it took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together. I mean  we had the wheel for some time. And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art. I just have time to read a more recent poem to you. If it has a subject  the subject is adolescence. And it's addressed to a certain person. It's called  To My Favorite    Year Old High School Girl.   Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon on the day you were born  you would be all done in only one more year  Of course  you couldn't have done that all alone. So never mind  you're fine just being yourself. You're loved for just being you. But did you know that at your age Judy Garland was pulling down         dollars a picture  Joan of Arc was leading the French army to victory and Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room    no wait  I mean he had invented the calculator  Of course  there will be time for all that later in your life  after you come out of your room and begin to blossom  or at least pick up all your socks. For some reason I keep remembering that Lady Jane Grey was queen of England when she was only   . But then she was beheaded  so never mind her as a role model. A few centuries later  when he was your age  Franz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family  but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies  four operas and two complete masses as a youngster. But of course  that was in Austria at the height of Romantic lyricism  not here in the suburbs of Cleveland. Frankly  who cares if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at    or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at     We think you're special just being you    playing with your food and staring into space. By the way  I lied about Schubert doing the dishes  but that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house.  Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Look  I had second thoughts  really  about whether I could talk about this to such a vital and alive audience as you guys. Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem  which goes   The truth will set you free  but first it will piss you off.   Laughter  So     Laughter  So with that in mind  I'm going to set about trying to do those things here  and talk about dying in the   st century. Now the first thing that will piss you off  undoubtedly  is that all of us are  in fact  going to die in the   st century. There will be no exceptions to that. There are  apparently  about one in eight of you who think you're immortal  on surveys  but    Unfortunately  that isn't going to happen. While I give this talk  in the next    minutes  a hundred million of my cells will die  and over the course of today        of my brain cells will die and never come back  so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece. Anyway  the second thing I want to say about dying in the   st century  apart from it's going to happen to everybody  is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us  unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on. So there you go. That's the truth. No doubt that will piss you off  and now let's see whether we can set you free. I don't promise anything. Now  as you heard in the intro  I work in intensive care  and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care. It's been a ride  man. This has been fantastic. We have machines that go ping. There's many of them up there. And we have some wizard technology which I think has worked really well  and over the course of the time I've worked in intensive care  the death rate for males in Australia has halved  and intensive care has had something to do with that. Certainly  a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that. So we have had tremendous success  and we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit  and we started using expressions like  lifesaving.  I really apologize to everybody for doing that  because obviously  we don't. What we do is prolong people's lives  and delay death  and redirect death  but we can't  strictly speaking  save lives on any sort of permanent basis. And what's really happened over the period of time that I've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the '  s  '  s  and '  s  are now coming to die in the   st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then. So what's happening now is there's been a big shift in the way that people die  and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when I was doing this in the '  s and '  s. So we kind of got a bit caught up with this  and we haven't really squared with you guys about what's really happening now  and it's about time we did. I kind of woke up to this bit in the late '  s when I met this guy. This guy is called Jim  Jim Smith  and he looked like this. I was called down to the ward to see him. His is the little hand. I was called down to the ward to see him by a respiratory physician. He said   Look  there's a guy down here. He's got pneumonia  and he looks like he needs intensive care. His daughter's here and she wants everything possible to be done.  Which is a familiar phrase to us. So I go down to the ward and see Jim  and his skin his translucent like this. You can see his bones through the skin. He's very  very thin  and he is  indeed  very sick with pneumonia  and he's too sick to talk to me  so I talk to his daughter Kathleen  and I say to her   Did you and Jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation   And she looked at me and said   No  of course not   I thought   Okay. Take this steady.  And I got talking to her  and after a while  she said to me   You know  we always thought there'd be time.  Jim was   .  Laughter  And I realized that something wasn't happening here. There wasn't this dialogue going on that I imagined was happening. So a group of us started doing survey work  and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in Newcastle  in the Newcastle area  and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating. One in a hundred. And only one in     of them had plan about what to do if they became seriously ill. And I realized  of course  this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large. Now  I work in acute care. This is John Hunter Hospital. And I thought  surely  we do better than that. So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die. And we didn't find a single record of any preference about goals  treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient. So we started to realize that we had a problem  and the problem is more serious because of this. What we know is that obviously we are all going to die  but how we die is actually really important  obviously not just to us  but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards. How we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us  and the stress created in families by dying is enormous  and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else  so dying in intensive care is not your top option if you've got a choice. And  if that wasn't bad enough  of course  all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you  in fact  about one in    of you at this point  will die in intensive care. In the U.S.  it's one in five. In Miami  it's three out of five people die in intensive care. So this is the sort of momentum that we've got at the moment. The reason why this is all happening is due to this  and I do have to take you through what this is about. These are the four ways to go. So one of these will happen to all of us. The ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest  sudden death. It's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here. Sudden death has become very rare. The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn't happen anymore. The dying process of those with terminal illness that we've just seen occurs to younger people. By the time you've reached     this is unlikely to happen to you. Only one in    people who are over    will die of cancer. The big growth industry are these. What you die of is increasing organ failure  with your respiratory  cardiac  renal  whatever organs packing up. Each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital  at the end of which  or at some point during which  somebody says  enough is enough  and we stop. And this one's the biggest growth industry of all  and at least six out of    of the people in this room will die in this form  which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty  and frailty's an inevitable part of aging  and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now  and the last few years  or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability  unfortunately. Enjoying it so far   Laughs  Sorry  I just feel such a  I feel such a Cassandra here. What can I say that's positive  What's positive is that this is happening at very great age  now. We are all  most of us  living to reach this point. You know  historically  we didn't do that. This is what happens to you when you live to be a great age  and unfortunately  increasing longevity does mean more old age  not more youth. I'm sorry to say that.  Laughter  What we did  anyway  look  what we did  we didn't just take this lying down at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere. We've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could  in fact  involve people much more in the way that things happen to them. But we realized  of course  that we are dealing with cultural issues  and this is  I love this Klimt painting  because the more you look at it  the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here  which is clearly the separation of death from the living  and the fear   Like  if you actually look  there's one woman there who has her eyes open. She's the one he's looking at  and  she's  the one he's coming for. Can you see that  She looks terrified. It's an amazing picture. Anyway  we had a major cultural issue. Clearly  people didn't want us to talk about death  or  we thought that. So with loads of funding from the Federal Government and the local Health Service  we introduced a thing at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices. We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die  and what would they prefer under those circumstances. They loved it. The families and the patients  they loved it. Ninety eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice  and that this is how things should work. And when they expressed wishes  all of those wishes came true  as it were. We were able to make that happen for them. But then  when the funding ran out  we went back to look six months later  and everybody had stopped again  and nobody was having these conversations anymore. So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us  because we thought this was going to really take off. The cultural issue had reasserted itself. So here's the pitch  I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up  particularly as we become older and increasingly frail and ICU has less and less and less to offer us. There has to be a little side road off there for people who don't want to go on that track. And I have one small idea  and one big idea about what could happen. And this is the small idea. The small idea is  let's all of us engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated. Why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this  There are a couple of things you can do. One of them is  you can  just ask this simple question. This question never fails.  In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself  who would you like to speak for you   That's a really important question to ask people  because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome. The second thing you can say is   Have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do   So that's the little idea. The big idea  I think  is more political. I think we have to get onto this. I suggested we should have Occupy Death. My wife said   Yeah  right  sit ins in the mortuary. Yeah  yeah. Sure.   Laughter  So that one didn't really run  but I was very struck by this. Now  I'm an aging hippie. I don't know  I don't think I look like that anymore  but I had  two of my kids were born at home in the '  s when home birth was a big thing  and we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation  so if you just replace all these words of birth  I like  Peace  Love  Natural Death  as an option. I do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it's going. Now  listen  that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia. I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all  I hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow. I don't think euthanasia matters. I actually think that  in places like Oregon  where you can have physician assisted suicide  you take a poisonous dose of stuff  only half a percent of people ever do that. I'm more interested in what happens to the   .  percent of people who don't want to do that. I think most people don't want to be dead  but I do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds. So I'm an opponent of euthanasia  but I do think we have to give people back some control. It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply. I think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia  not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all. This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders  whom I met when I was a medical student. She founded the hospice movement. And she said   You matter because you are  and you matter to the last moment of your life.  And I firmly believe that that's the message that we have to carry forward. Thank you.  Applause  The electricity powering the lights in this theater was generated just moments ago. Because the way things stand today  electricity demand must be in constant balance with electricity supply. If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage  some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid  the difference would have to be made up from other generators immediately. But coal plants  nuclear plants can't respond fast enough. A giant battery could. With a giant battery  we'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal  gas and nuclear do today. You see  the battery is the key enabling device here. With it  we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun doesn't shine. And that changes everything. Because then renewables such as wind and solar come out from the wings  here to center stage. Today I want to tell you about such a device. It's called the liquid metal battery. It's a new form of energy storage that I invented at MIT along with a team of my students and post docs. Now the theme of this year's TED Conference is Full Spectrum. The OED defines spectrum as  The entire range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation  from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays of which the range of visible light is only a small part.  So I'm not here today only to tell you how my team at MIT has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world's great problems. I want to go full spectrum and tell you how  in the process of developing this new technology  we've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies that can serve as lessons for innovation  ideas worth spreading. And you know  if we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation  we can't just conserve our way out  we can't just drill our way out  we can't bomb our way out. We're going to do it the old fashioned American way  we're going to invent our way out  working together. Now let's get started. The battery was invented about     years ago by a professor  Alessandro Volta  at the University of Padua in Italy. His invention gave birth to a new field of science  electrochemistry  and new technologies such as electroplating. Perhaps overlooked  Volta's invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor. Until Volta  nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use. Here's the first battery    a stack of coins  zinc and silver  separated by cardboard soaked in brine. This is the starting point for designing a battery    two electrodes  in this case metals of different composition  and an electrolyte  in this case salt dissolved in water. The science is that simple. Admittedly  I've left out a few details. Now I've taught you that battery science is straightforward and the need for grid level storage is compelling  but the fact is that today there is simply no battery technology capable of meeting the demanding performance requirements of the grid    namely uncommonly high power  long service lifetime and super low cost. We need to think about the problem differently. We need to think big  we need to think cheap. So let's abandon the paradigm of let's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product. Instead  let's invent to the price point of the electricity market. So that means that certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically off limits. This battery needs to be made out of earth abundant elements. I say  if you want to make something dirt cheap  make it out of dirt    preferably dirt that's locally sourced. And we need to be able to build this thing using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don't cost us a fortune. So about six years ago  I started thinking about this problem. And in order to adopt a fresh perspective  I sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage. In fact  I looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity  but instead consumes electricity  huge amounts of it. I'm talking about the production of aluminum. The process was invented in      by a couple of    year olds    Hall in the United States and Heroult in France. And just a few short years following their discovery  aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver to a common structural material. You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter. It's about    feet wide and recedes about half a mile    row after row of cells that  inside  resemble Volta's battery  with three important differences. Volta's battery works at room temperature. It's fitted with solid electrodes and an electrolyte that's a solution of salt and water. The Hall Heroult cell operates at high temperature  a temperature high enough that the aluminum metal product is liquid. The electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water  but rather salt that's melted. It's this combination of liquid metal  molten salt and high temperature that allows us to send high current through this thing. Today  we can produce virgin metal from ore at a cost of less than    cents a pound. That's the economic miracle of modern electrometallurgy. It is this that caught and held my attention to the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale. And I did. I made the battery all liquid    liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte. I'll show you how. So I put low density liquid metal at the top  put a high density liquid metal at the bottom  and molten salt in between. So now  how to choose the metals  For me  the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table  enunciated by another professor  Dimitri Mendeleyev. Everything we know is made of some combination of what you see depicted here. And that includes our own bodies. I recall the very moment one day when I was searching for a pair of metals that would meet the constraints of earth abundance  different  opposite density and high mutual reactivity. I felt the thrill of realization when I knew I'd come upon the answer. Magnesium for the top layer. And antimony for the bottom layer. You know  I've got to tell you  one of the greatest benefits of being a professor  colored chalk. So to produce current  magnesium loses two electrons to become magnesium ion  which then migrates across the electrolyte  accepts two electrons from the antimony  and then mixes with it to form an alloy. The electrons go to work in the real world out here  powering our devices. Now to charge the battery  we connect a source of electricity. It could be something like a wind farm. And then we reverse the current. And this forces magnesium to de alloy and return to the upper electrode  restoring the initial constitution of the battery. And the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature. It's pretty cool  at least in theory. But does it really work  So what to do next  We go to the laboratory. Now do I hire seasoned professionals  No  I hire a student and mentor him  teach him how to think about the problem  to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose. This is that student  David Bradwell  who  in this image  appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work. What I didn't tell David at the time was I myself wasn't convinced it would work. But David's young and he's smart and he wants a Ph.D.  and he proceeds to build    He proceeds to build the first ever liquid metal battery of this chemistry. And based on David's initial promising results  which were paid with seed funds at MIT  I was able to attract major research funding from the private sector and the federal government. And that allowed me to expand my group to    people  a mix of graduate students  post docs and even some undergraduates. And I was able to attract really  really good people  people who share my passion for science and service to society  not science and service for career building. And if you ask these people why they work on liquid metal battery  their answer would hearken back to President Kennedy's remarks at Rice University in      when he said    and I'm taking liberties here     We choose to work on grid level storage  not because it is easy  but because it is hard.  So this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery. We start here with our workhorse one watt hour cell. I called it the shotglass. We've operated over     of these  perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries    not just magnesium and antimony. Along the way we scaled up to the    watt hour cell. I call it the hockey puck. And we got the same remarkable results. And then it was onto the saucer. That's     watt hours. The technology was proving itself to be robust and scalable. But the pace wasn't fast enough for us. So a year and a half ago  David and I  along with another research staff member  formed a company to accelerate the rate of progress and the race to manufacture product. So today at LMBC  we're building cells    inches in diameter with a capacity of one kilowatt hour          times the capacity of that initial shotglass cell. We call that the pizza. And then we've got a four kilowatt hour cell on the horizon. It's going to be    inches in diameter. We call that the bistro table  but it's not ready yet for prime time viewing. And one variant of the technology has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules  aggregating the modules into a giant battery that fits in a    foot shipping container for placement in the field. And this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt hours    two million watt hours. That's enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of     American households. So here you have it  grid level storage  silent  emissions free  no moving parts  remotely controlled  designed to the market price point without subsidy. So what have we learned from all this  So what have we learned from all this  Let me share with you some of the surprises  the heterodoxies. They lie beyond the visible. Temperature  Conventional wisdom says set it low  at or near room temperature  and then install a control system to keep it there. Avoid thermal runaway. Liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature with minimum regulation. Our battery can handle the very high temperature rises that come from current surges. Scaling  Conventional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many. Liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost by producing fewer  but they'll be larger. And finally  human resources  Conventional wisdom says hire battery experts  seasoned professionals  who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge. To develop liquid metal battery  I hired students and post docs and mentored them. In a battery  I strive to maximize electrical potential  when mentoring  I strive to maximize human potential. So you see  the liquid metal battery story is more than an account of inventing technology  it's a blueprint for inventing inventors  full spectrum. You should be nice to nerds. In fact  I'd go so far as to say  if you don't already have a nerd in your life  you should get one. I'm just saying. Scientists and engineers change the world. I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure. Now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize  because when you remove the fear of failure  impossible things suddenly become possible. If you want to know how  ask yourself this question  What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail  If you really ask yourself this question  you can't help but feel uncomfortable. I feel a little uncomfortable. Because when you ask it  you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you  how it keeps us from attempting great things  and life gets dull  amazing things stop happening. Sure  good things happen  but amazing things stop happening. Now I should be clear  I'm not encouraging failure  I'm discouraging fear of failure. Because it's not failure itself that constrains us. The path to truly new  never been done before things always has failure along the way. We're tested. And in part  that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great. Clemenceau said   Life gets interesting when we fail  because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves.  In       Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible. In October of       the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in    million years we could build an aircraft that would fly. And two months later on December   th  Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina. The flight lasted    seconds and covered     feet. That was     . One year later  the next declarations of impossibilities began. Ferdinand Foch  a French army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the French army  said   Airplanes are interesting toys  but of no military value.     years later  aero experts coined the term transonic. They debated  should it have one S or two  You see  they were having trouble in this flight regime  and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound. In       there was no wind tunnel data beyond Mach  .  . And yet  on Tuesday  October   th        Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X   and he flew towards an unknown possibility  and in so doing  he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound. Six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad. After    complete mission failures  we got our first images from space. And on that first flight we got more data than in all U   missions combined. It took a lot of failures to get there. Since we took to the sky  we have wanted to fly faster and farther. And to do so  we've had to believe in impossible things. And we've had to refuse to fear failure. That's still true today. Today  we don't talk about flying transonically  or even supersonically  we talk about flying hypersonically    not Mach   or Mach    Mach   . At Mach     we can fly from New York to Long Beach in    minutes and    seconds. At that speed  the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel          degrees Fahrenheit    like a blast furnace. We are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it. And we are flying it  or trying to. DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built. It's boosted to near space atop a Minotaur IV rocket. Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse  so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an    degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory. That's an unnatural act for a rocket. The third stage has a camera. We call it rocketcam. And it's pointed at the hypersonic glider. This is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one. Now to conceal the shape  we changed the aspect ratio a little bit. But this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth. We've flown twice. In the first flight  no aerodynamic control of the vehicle. But we collected more hypersonic flight data than in    years of ground based testing combined. And in the second flight  three minutes of fully controlled  aerodynamic flight at Mach   . We must fly again  because amazing  never been done before things require that you fly. You can't learn to fly at Mach    unless you fly. And while there's no substitute for speed  maneuverability is a very close second. If a Mach    glider takes    minutes and    seconds to get from New York to Long Beach  a hummingbird would take  well  days. You see  hummingbirds are not hypersonic  but they are maneuverable. In fact  the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards. It can fly up  down  forwards  backwards  even upside down. And so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can't go  we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so. This is a hummingbird drone. It can fly in all directions  even backwards. It can hover and rotate. This prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera. It weighs less than one AA battery. It does not eat nectar. In       it flew for a whopping    seconds  a year later  two minutes  then six  eventually   . Many prototypes crashed    many. But there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly. It's beautiful  isn't it. Wow. It's great. Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot. Failure is part of creating new and amazing things. We cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things    like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain  or maybe even ice  a robot that can run like a cheetah  or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human. Or perhaps  Spider Man will one day be Gecko Man. A gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe. One square millimeter of a gecko's footpad has        hair like structures called setae. They are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces. Today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot. The result  a four by four inch artificial nano gecko adhesive. can support a static load of     pounds. That's enough to stick six    inch plasma TV's to your wall  no nails. So much for Velcro  right  And it's not just passive structures  it's entire machines. This is a spider mite. It's one millimeter long  but it looks like Godzilla next to these micromachines. In the world of Godzilla spider mites  we can make millions of mirrors  each one fifth the diameter of a human hair  moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays  so that we can watch movies like  Godzilla  in high def. And if we can build machines at that scale  what about Eiffel Tower like trusses at the microscale  Today we are making metals that are lighter than Styrofoam  so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air    so light that you can make a car that two people can lift  but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an SUV. From the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature's storms. There are    lightning strikes per second around the globe. Each lightning bolt heats the air to        degrees Fahrenheit    hotter than the surface of the Sun. What if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons  beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters  Experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS. Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains. Using a grid the size of your thumb  with    electrodes on the surface of his brain  Tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm. And his thoughts made him reach for Katie. This is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone. And it is the first time that Tim has held Katie's hand in seven years. That moment mattered to Tim and Katie  and this green goo may someday matter to you. This green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life. It was made in tobacco plants. Tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months  and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever. And if it seems far fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy  what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve  Last September  the gamers of Foldit solved the three dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys. Now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments. For    years  it was unsolved in the scientific community. The gamers of Foldit solved it in    days. Now they were able to do so by working together. They were able to work together because they're connected by the Internet. And others  also connected to the Internet  used it as an instrument of democracy. And together they changed the fate of their nation. The Internet is home to two billion people  or    percent of the world's population. It allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals. It allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group. But it too had humble beginnings. In       the internet was but a dream  a few sketches on a piece of paper. And then on October   th  the first packet switched message was sent from UCLA to SRI. The first two letters of the word  Login   that's all that made it through    an L and an O    and then a buffer overflow crashed the system. Two letters  an L and an O  now a worldwide force. So who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA  They are nerds  and they are heroes among us. They challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions. They remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure. They remind us that we all have nerd power. Sometimes we just forget. You see  there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure  when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing  you were good at math  you could build things  you were an astronaut  an adventurer  Jacques Cousteau  you could jump higher  run faster  kick harder than anyone. You believed in impossible things and you were fearless. You were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero. Scientists and engineers can indeed change the world. So can you. You were born to. So go ahead  ask yourself  what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail  Now I want to say  this is not easy. It's hard to hold onto this feeling  really hard. I guess in some way  I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard. Doubt and fear always creep in. We think someone else  someone smarter than us  someone more capable  someone with more resources will solve that problem. But there isn't anyone else  there's just you. And if we're lucky  in that moment  someone steps into that doubt and fear  takes a hand and says   Let me help you believe.  Jason Harley did that for me. Jason started at DARPA on March   th      . He was with our transportation team. I saw Jason nearly every day  sometimes twice a day. And more so than most  he saw the highs and the lows  the celebrations and the disappointments. And on one particularly dark day for me  Jason sat down and he wrote an email. He was encouraging  but firm. And when he hit send  he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make. It mattered to me. In that moment and still today when I doubt  when I feel afraid  when I need to reconnect with that feeling  I remember his words  they were so powerful. Text   There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you.    Superhero  superhero.     Superhero  superhero.     Superhero  superhero.     Superhero  superhero.     Superhero  superhero.   Voice  Because that's what being a superhero is all about. RD   There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you.  And remember  be nice to nerds. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Regina  thank you. I have a couple of questions. So that glider of yours  the Mach    glider  the first one  no control  it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere. RD  Yeah  yeah. It did.  CA  What happened on that second flight   Yeah  it also went into the Pacific.  CA  But this time under control   We didn't fly it into the Pacific. No  there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed. And so in the second flight  we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it. CA  I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach anytime soon. RD  It might be a little warm. CA  What do you picture that glider being used for  RD  Well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this. How it's ultimately used will be determined by the military. Now the purpose of the vehicle though  the purpose of the technology  is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than    minutes. CA  And to carry a payload of more than a few pounds   RD  Yeah.  Like what's the payload it could carry  RD  Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be  right. We've got to fly it first. CA  But not necessarily just a camera  RD  No  not necessarily just a camera. CA  It's amazing. The hummingbird  RD  Yeah  CA  I'm curious  you started your beautiful sequence on flight with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly  and there haven't been that many planes built since that flap wings. Why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird  Isn't that a very expensive solution for a small maneuverable flying object  RD  So I mean  in part  we wondered if it was possible to do it. And you have to revisit these questions over time. The folks at AeroVironment tried     or more different wing designs     different forms of the avionics. It took them    full prototypes to get something that would actually fly. But there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize. So we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing  but when things looks just natural  you also don't see them. CA  Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance. It's partly the look.  RD  Sure.  It's actually   Look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters.  Because I think  as well as the awe of looking at that  I'm sure some people here are thinking  technology catches up so quick  how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies one through a window of the White House  I mean  do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here  RD  Well look  our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise. That's what we do. It would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time. It's just the nature of what we do. Now our responsibility is to push that edge. And we have to be  of course  mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used  but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing  it's advancing. CA  I mean  you're clearly a really inspiring leader. And you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention  but at a personal level  in a way I can't imagine doing your job. Do you wake up in the night sometimes  just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of your team's brilliance  RD  Sure. I think you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions. CA  How do you answer them  RD  Well I don't always have answers for them  right. I think that we learn as time goes on. My job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have. I work with some of the most amazing people. And with that exhilaration  comes a really deep sense of responsibility. And so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible and this tremendous seriousness of what it means. CA  Regina  that was jaw dropping  as they say. Thank you so much for coming to TED.  RD  Thank you.  Many times I go around the world to speak  and people ask me questions about the challenges  my moments  some of my regrets.       A single mother of four  three months after the birth of my fourth child  I went to do a job as a research assistant. I went to Northern Liberia. And as part of the work  the village would give you lodgings. And they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter. This girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade. She was the laughing stock of the community. Her mother was often told by other women   You and your child will die poor.  After two weeks of working in that village  it was time to go back. The mother came to me  knelt down  and said   Leymah  take my daughter. I wish for her to be a nurse.  Dirt poor  living in the home with my parents  I couldn't afford to. With tears in my eyes  I said   No.  Two months later  I go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief. The women's chief of the village has this little girl  fair color like me  totally dirty. And all day she walked around only in her underwear. When I asked   Who is that   She said   That's Wei. The meaning of her name is pig. Her mother died while giving birth to her  and no one had any idea who her father was.  For two weeks  she became my companion  slept with me. I bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll. The night before I left  she came to the room and said   Leymah  don't leave me here. I wish to go with you. I wish to go to school.  Dirt poor  no money  living with my parents  I again said   No.  Two months later  both of those villages fell into another war. Till today  I have no idea where those two girls are. Fast forward        In the peak of our activism  the minister of Gender Liberia called me and said   Leymah  I have a nine year old for you. I want you to bring her home because we don't have safe homes.  The story of this little girl  She had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months. She came to me bloated  very pale. Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor. She'd lie beside me and say   Auntie  I wish to be well. I wish to go to school.        A young woman stands before President Sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together  their father and mother died during the war. She's     her dream is to go to college to be able to support them. She's highly athletic. One of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship. Full scholarship. She gets it. Her dream of going to school  her wish of being educated  is finally here. She goes to school on the first day. The director of sports who's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class. And for the next three years  her fate will be having sex with him every day  as a favor for getting her in school. Globally  we have policies  international instruments  work leaders. Great people have made commitments    we will protect our children from want and from fear. The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Countries like America  we've heard things like No Child Left Behind. Other countries come with different things. There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls. All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally  I think  has failed. In Liberia  for example  the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every    girls. Teen prostitution is at its peak. In one community  we're told  you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper. Girls as young as    being prostituted for less than a dollar a night. It's disheartening  it's sad. And then someone asked me  just before my TEDTalk  a few days ago   So where is the hope   Several years ago  a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women. It's not enough to say you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia when your girls' kids are totally out there and no hope  or seemingly no hope. We created a space called the Young Girls Transformative Project. We go into rural communities and all we do  like has been done in this room  is create the space. When these girls sit  you unlock intelligence  you unlock passion  you unlock commitment  you unlock focus  you unlock great leaders. Today  we've worked with over    . And some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps  as young mothers  to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women. One young woman I met  teen mother of four  never thought about finishing high school  graduated successfully  never thought about going to college  enrolled in college. One day she said to me   My wish is to finish college and be able to support my children.  She's at a place where she can't find money to go to school. She sells water  sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones. And you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education. Juanita is her name. She takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school. Says   Leymah  my wish is to be educated. And if I can't be educated  when I see some of my sisters being educated  my wish has been fulfilled. I wish for a better life. I wish for food for my children. I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop.  This is the dream of the African girl. Several years ago  there was one African girl. This girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry. Angry  frustrated  really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children  this young girl started a movement  a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace. I will fulfill the wish. This is another African girl's wish. I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls. I failed to do this. These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman    I failed  I failed  I failed. So I will do this. Women came out  protested a brutal dictator  fearlessly spoke. Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true  the wish of peace came true. This young woman wished also to go to school. She went to school. This young woman wished for other things to happen  it happened for her. Today  this young woman is me  a Nobel laureate. I'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish  in my tiny capacity  of little African girls    the wish of being educated. We set up a foundation. We're giving full four year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential. I don't have much to ask of you. I've also been to places in this U.S.  and I know that girls in this country also have wishes  a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx  a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown L.A.  a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas  a wish for a better life somewhere in New York  a wish for a better life somewhere in New Jersey. Will you journey with me to help that girl  be it an African girl or an American girl or a Japanese girl  fulfill her wish  fulfill her dream  achieve that dream  Because all of these great innovators and inventors that we've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world  and all they're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence  unlock the passion  unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves. Let's journey together. Let's journey together. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much. Right now in Liberia  what do you see as the main issue that troubles you  LG  I've been asked to lead the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative. As part of my work  I'm doing these tours in different villages and towns           hours on dirt roads    and there is no community that I've gone into that I haven't seen intelligent girls. But sadly  the vision of a great future  or the dream of a great future  is just a dream  because you have all of these vices. Teen pregnancy  like I said  is epidemic. So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I'm at this place  and I just don't want to be the only one at this place. I'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me. I want to look back    years from now and see that there's another Liberian girl  Ghanaian girl  Nigerian girl  Ethiopian girl standing on this TED stage. And maybe  just maybe  saying   Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today.  So I'm troubled when I see them like there's no hope. But I'm also not pessimistic  because I know it doesn't take a lot to get them charged up. CA  And in the last year  tell us one hopeful thing that you've seen happening. LG  I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening. But in the last year  where President Sirleaf comes from  her village  we went there to work with these girls. And we could not find    girls in high school. All of these girls went to the gold mine  and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things. We took    of those girls and we worked with them. And this was at the beginning of elections. This is one place where women were never    even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men. These girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration. This is a real rural village. And the theme they used was   Even pretty girls vote.  They were able to mobilize young women. But not only did they do that  they went to those who were running for seats to ask them   What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win   And one of the guys who already had a seat was very    because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws  and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric. Rape is not barbaric  but the law  he said  was barbaric. And when the girls started engaging him  he was very hostile towards them. These little girls turned to him and said   We will vote you out of office.  He's out of office today. CA  Leymah  thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED. LG  You're welcome.  CA  Thank you.  This may sound strange  but I'm a big fan of the concrete block. The first concrete blocks were manufactured in      with a very simple idea  modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together. Very quickly concrete blocks became the most used construction unit in the world. They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us  buildings  bridges  one brick at a time. Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time. Almost a hundred years later in       LEGO came up with this. It was called the Automatic Binding Brick. And in a few short years  LEGO bricks took place in every household. It's estimated that over     billion bricks have been produced    or    bricks for every person on the planet. You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses  beautiful bridges  beautiful buildings. LEGO made it accessible. LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block  the building block of the world  and made it into the building block of our imagination. Meanwhile the exact same year  at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced  the next building block. The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive. Like the concrete block  the transistor allows you to build much larger  more complex circuits  one brick at a time. But there's a main difference  The transistor was only for experts. I personally don't accept this  that the building block of our time is reserved for experts  so I decided to change that. Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab  I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers. A few years ago I started developing littleBits. Let me show you how they work. LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function. They're pre engineered to be light  sound  motors and sensors. And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets. So you can't put them the wrong way. The bricks are color coded. Green is output  blue is power  pink is input and orange is wire. So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits. You put a blue to a green  you can make light. You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer. Switch out the knob for a pulse module  which is here  and now you've made a little blinker. Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine. I'm going to stop that. So beyond simple play  littleBits are actually pretty powerful. Instead of having to program  to wire  to solder  littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures. So to make this blink faster or slower  you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower. The idea behind littleBits is that it's a growing library. We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready to use brick. Lights  sounds  solar panels  motors    everything should be accessible. We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them. And it's been an incredible experience. The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools. For example  how a nightlight works  or why an elevator door stays open  or how an iPod responds to touch. We've also been taking littleBits to design schools. So for example  we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material. Here you see  with felt and paper water bottles  we have Geordie making ... A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever    just cardboard  wood and paper    and told them  Make something.  Here's an example of a project they made  a motion activated confetti canon ball. But wait  this is actually my favorite project. It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark. To these non engineers  littleBits became another material  electronics became just another material. And we want to make this material accessible to everyone. So littleBits is open source. You can go on the website  download all the design files  make them yourself. We want to encourage a world of creators  of inventors  of contributors  because this world that we live in  this interactive world  is ours. So go ahead and start inventing. Thank you. Marco Tempest  What I'd like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment. Today's its debut. It's a demonstration of augmented reality. And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded. They are live and reacting to me in real time. I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic. So fingers crossed. And keep your eyes on the big screen. Augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer generated imagery. It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask  why  in a technological age  we continue to have this magical sense of wonder. Magic is deception  but it is a deception we enjoy. To enjoy being deceived  an audience must first suspend its disbelief. It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind. Samuel Taylor Coleridge  I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that  for a moment  constitutes poetic faith. MT  This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience. Without it  a script is just words. Augmented reality is just the latest technology. And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity. We are all very good at suspending our disbelief. We do it every day  while reading novels  watching television or going to the movies. We willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had. Without this ability there is no magic. It was Jean Robert Houdin  France's greatest illusionist  who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller. He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio. Jean Robert Houdin  A conjurer is not a juggler. He is an actor playing the part of a magician. MT  Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story. The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction. There are tales of creation and loss  death and resurrection  and obstacles that must be overcome. Now many of them are intensely dramatic. Magicians play with fire and steel  defy the fury of the buzzsaw  dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape. But audiences don't come to see the magician die  they come to see him live. Because the best stories always have a happy ending. The tricks of magic have one special element. They are stories with a twist. Now Edward de Bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines. He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think. Edward de Bono  Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error. The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable  but do not  in fact  match what is being done in front of them. MT  In that respect  magic tricks are like jokes. Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination. But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected  we laugh. The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks. The finale defies logic  gives new insight into the problem  and audiences express their amazement with laughter. It's fun to be fooled. One of the key qualities of all stories is that they're made to be shared. We feel compelled to tell them. When I do a trick at a party    that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again. They want to share the experience. That makes my job more difficult  because  if I want to surprise them  I need to tell a story that starts the same  but ends differently    a trick with a twist on a twist. It keeps me busy. Now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained. We think in narrative structures. We connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood. It's a uniquely human achievement. We all want to share our stories  whether it is the trick we saw at the party  the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation. Today  thanks to technology  we can share those stories as never before  by email  Facebook  blogs  tweets  on TED.com. The tools of social networking  these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story. We turn facts into similes and metaphors  and even fantasies. We polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole. Our stories make us the people we are and  sometimes  the people we want to be. They give us our identity and a sense of community. And if the story is a good one  it might even make us smile. Thank you. Thank you.
