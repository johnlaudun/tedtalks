Cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet. By the time you realize what's happening  the child is a toddler  up and causing havoc  and it's too late to put it back. We humans are Earth's Pandoran species. We're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box  and we can't push it back in. We're seeing the consequences all around us. Now that  I suggest  is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously. And it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet  but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos. So first of all  I'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes  and secondly  how this might answer questions about who's out there  if indeed anyone is. So  memetics  memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism. Darwin had this amazing idea. Indeed  some people say it's the best idea anybody ever had. Isn't that a wonderful thought  that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had  Do you think there could  Audience  No. Susan Blackmore  Someone says no  very loudly  from over there. Well  I say yes  and if there is  I give the prize to Darwin. Why  Because the idea was so simple  and yet it explains all design in the universe. I would say not just biological design  but all of the design that we think of as human design. It's all just the same thing happening. What did Darwin say  I know you know the idea  natural selection  but let me just paraphrase  The Origin of Species         in a few sentences. What Darwin said was something like this  if you have creatures that vary  and that can't be doubted    I've been to the Galapagos  and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on  and so on. And     pages later. And if there is a struggle for life  such that nearly all of these creatures die    and this can't be doubted  I've read Malthus and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted  and so on and so on. And another     pages later. And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive  then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were. You see the idea  If  if  if  then. He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm  but that's what he described in that book  and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm. The principle is you just need those three things    variation  selection and heredity. And as Dan Dennett puts it  if you have those  then you must get evolution. Or design out of chaos  without the aid of mind. There's one word I love on that slide. What do you think my favorite word is  Audience  Chaos. SB  Chaos  No. What  Mind  No. Audience  Without. SB  No  not without. You try them all in order  Mmm...  Audience  Must. SB  Must  at must. Must  must. This is what makes it so amazing. You don't need a designer  or a plan  or foresight  or anything else. If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected  then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. You can't stop it. Must is my favorite word there. Now  what's this to do with memes  Well  the principle here applies to anything that is copied with variation and selection. We're so used to thinking in terms of biology  we think about genes this way. Darwin didn't  of course  he didn't know about genes. He talked mostly about animals and plants  but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct. But the principle of Universal Darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design. And this is what Richard Dawkins was on about in his      bestseller   The Selfish Gene.  The information that is copied  he called the replicator. It selfishly copies. Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going   I want to get copied.  But that it will get copied if it can  regardless of the consequences. It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't  because it's just information being copied. And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes  and so he said   Is there another replicator out there on the planet   Ah  yes  there is. Look around you    here will do  in this room. All around us  still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture  is another replicator. Information that we copy from person to person  by imitation  by language  by talking  by telling stories  by wearing clothes  by doing things. This is information copied with variation and selection. This is design process going on. He wanted a name for the new replicator. So  he took the Greek word  mimeme   which means that which is imitated. Remember that  that's the core definition  that which is imitated. And abbreviated it to meme  just because it sounds good and made a good meme  an effective spreading meme. So that's how the idea came about. It's important to stick with that definition. The whole science of memetics is much maligned  much misunderstood  much feared. But a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition. A meme is not equivalent to an idea. It's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else  really. Stick with the definition. It's that which is imitated  or information which is copied from person to person. So  let's see some memes. Well  you sir  you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way. I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself  or copied it from someone else  If you copied it from someone else  it's a meme. And what about  oh  I can't see any interesting memes here. All right everyone  who's got some interesting memes for me  Oh  well  your earrings  I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings. You probably went out and bought them. There are plenty more in the shops. That's something that's passed on from person to person. All the stories that we're telling    well  of course  TED is a great meme fest  masses of memes. The way to think about memes  though  is to think  why do they spread  They're selfish information  they will get copied  if they can. But some of them will be copied because they're good  or true  or useful  or beautiful. Some of them will be copied even though they're not. Some  it's quite hard to tell why. There's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy. And I'm glad to say  as I expected  I found it when I came here  and I'm sure all of you found it  too. You go to your nice  posh  international hotel somewhere  and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom  and what do you see  Audience  Bathroom soap. SB  Pardon  Audience  Soap. SB  Soap  yeah. What else do you see  Audience   Inaudible  SB  Mmm mmm. Audience  Sink  toilet  SB  Sink  toilet  yes  these are all memes  they're all memes  but they're sort of useful ones  and then there's this one. What is this one doing  This has spread all over the world. It's not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your bathrooms here. But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco camp in the jungle in Assam. Who folded that thing up there  and why  Some people get carried away. Other people are just lazy and make mistakes. Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker. What is this all about  I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's cleaned the place  and it's all lovely. And you know  actually  all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread germs from place to place. So  think of it this way. Imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes. The memes are all trying to get copied    trying  in inverted commas    i.e.  that's the shorthand for  if they can get copied  they will. They're using you and me as their propagating  copying machinery  and we are the meme machines. Now  why is this important  Why is this useful  or what does it tell us  It gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human  all conventional theories of cultural evolution  of the origin of humans  and what makes us so different from other species. All other theories explaining the big brain  and language  and tool use and all these things that make us unique  are based upon genes. Language must have been useful for the genes. Tool use must have enhanced our survival  mating and so on. It always comes back  as Richard Dawkins complained all that long time ago  it always comes back to genes. The point of memetics is to say   Oh no  it doesn't.  There are two replicators now on this planet. From the moment that our ancestors  perhaps two and a half million years ago or so  began imitating  there was a new copying process. Copying with variation and selection. A new replicator was let loose  and it could never be    right from the start    it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature  could just copy the useful  beautiful  true things  and not copy the other things. While their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy    lighting fires  keeping fires going  new techniques of hunting  these kinds of things    inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair  or wearing strange clothes  or painting their faces  or whatever. So  you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff  and the memes themselves  like the sounds that people made and copied    in other words  what turned out to be language    competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger. So  the big brain  on this theory  is driven by the memes. This is why  in  The Meme Machine   I called it memetic drive. As the memes evolve  as they inevitably must  they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving. This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains  that we like religion  and music  and art. Language is a parasite that we've adapted to  not something that was there originally for our genes  on this view. And like most parasites  it can begin dangerous  but then it coevolves and adapts  and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite. And so  from our perspective  we don't realize that that's how it began. So  this is a view of what humans are. All other species on this planet are gene machines only  they don't imitate at all well  hardly at all. We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well. The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine. But that's not all. We have a new kind of memes now. I've been wondering for a long time  since I've been thinking about memes a lot  is there a difference between the memes that we copy    the words we speak to each other  the gestures we copy  the human things    and all these technological things around us  I have always  until now  called them all memes  but I do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes. Let's call them techno memes or temes. Because the processes are getting different. We began  perhaps       years ago  with writing. We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet  but in order to get true temes and true teme machines  you need to get the variation  the selection and the copying  all done outside of humans. And we're getting there. We're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there  that there are machines like that. And indeed  in the short time I've already been at TED  I see we're even closer than I thought we were before. So actually  now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines. Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read  learning to use machinery. We're going to have all kinds of implants  drugs that force us to stay awake all the time. We'll think we're choosing these things  but the temes are making us do it. So  we're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet. Now  what about what else is going on out there in the universe  Is there anyone else out there  People have been asking this question for a long time. We've been asking it here at TED already. In       Frank Drake made his famous equation  but I think he concentrated on the wrong things. It's been very productive  that equation. He wanted to estimate N  the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy  and he included in there the rate of star formation  the rate of planets  but crucially  intelligence. I think that's the wrong way to think about it. Intelligence appears all over the place  in all kinds of guises. Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing. But what's really important is the replicators you have and the levels of replicators  one feeding on the one before. So  I would suggest that we don't think intelligence  we think replicators. And on that basis  I've suggested a different kind of equation. A very simple equation. N  the same thing  the number of communicative civilizations out there  that  we might expect in our galaxy. Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy. The fraction of those which get a first replicator. The fraction of those that get the second replicator. The fraction of those that get the third replicator. Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out    sending information  sending probes  getting out there  and communicating with anywhere else. OK  so if we take that equation  why haven't we heard from anybody out there  Because every step is dangerous. Getting a new replicator is dangerous. You can pull through  we have pulled through  but it's dangerous. Take the first step  as soon as life appeared on this earth. We may take the Gaian view. I loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday    it's not Gaian all the time. Actually  life forms produce things that kill themselves. Well  we did pull through on this planet. But then  a long time later  billions of years later  we got the second replicator  the memes. That was dangerous  all right. Think of the big brain. How many mothers do we have here  You know all about big brains. They are dangerous to give birth to  are agonizing to give birth to. My cat gave birth to four kittens  purring all the time. Ah  mm    slightly different. But not only is it painful  it kills lots of babies  it kills lots of mothers  and it's very expensive to produce. The genes are forced into producing all this myelin  all the fat to myelinate the brain. Do you know  sitting here  your brain is using about    percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight  It's a really expensive organ to run. Why  Because it's producing the memes. Now  it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off  and maybe it nearly did  but you see  we don't know. But maybe it nearly did. Has it been tried before  What about all those other species  Louise Leakey talked yesterday about how we're the only one in this branch left. What happened to the others  Could it be that this experiment in imitation  this experiment in a second replicator  is dangerous enough to kill people off  Well  we did pull through  and we adapted. But now  we're hitting  as I've just described  we're hitting the third replicator point. And this is even more dangerous    well  it's dangerous again. Why  Because the temes are selfish replicators and they don't care about us  or our planet  or anything else. They're just information  why would they  They are using us to suck up the planet's resources to produce more computers  and more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED. Don't think   Oh  we created the Internet for our own benefit.  That's how it seems to us. Think  temes spreading because they must. We are the old machines. Now  are we going to pull through  What's going to happen  What does it mean to pull through  Well  there are kind of two ways of pulling through. One that is obviously happening all around us now  is that the temes turn us into teme machines  with these implants  with the drugs  with us merging with the technology. And why would they do that  Because we are self replicating. We have babies. We make new ones  and so it's convenient to piggyback on us  because we're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable. Although it's closer  I heard this morning  it's closer than I thought it was. Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves. That way  it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate was utterly destabilized  and it was no longer possible for humans to live here. Because those teme machines  they wouldn't need    they're not squishy  wet  oxygen breathing  warmth requiring creatures. They could carry on without us. So  those are the two possibilities. The second  I don't think we're that close. It's coming  but we're not there yet. The first  it's coming too. But the damage that is already being done to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is  that third danger point  getting a third replicator. And will we get through this third danger point  like we got through the second and like we got through the first  Maybe we will  maybe we won't. I have no idea. Chris Anderson  That was an incredible talk. SB  Thank you. I scared myself. CA   Laughter  So  I'm in Chile  in the Atacama desert  sitting in a hotel lobby  because that's the only place that I can get a Wi Fi connection  and I have this picture up on my screen  and a woman comes up behind me. She says   Oh  that's beautiful. What is it  Is that Jackson Pollock   And unfortunately  I can be a little too honest. I said   No  it's    it's penguin shit.  And  you know   Excuse me   And I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically. So  I said   No  no  really    it's penguin shit.  Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands taking pictures of penguins. This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical. So  literally  a few minutes before that  I downloaded this scientific paper about calculations on avian defecation  which is really quite interesting  because it turns out you can model this as something called  Poiseuille flow   and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum. Actually  technically  it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca. At this point  she stops me  and she says   Who are you  Wha    what do you do   And I was stuck  because I didn't have any way to describe what I do. And so  in some sense  this talk today is my answer to that. It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do. And it's very hard for me to make sense of it  so I'm not sure that you can. It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes    often at four in the morning. So  some people are afraid of what I do. Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano  and in response  I have ordered a bulletproof pocket protector. I'm not sure what these people think  because I don't speak Norsk. But I'm not thinking  monsteret  is a good thing. I don't know  you know  So  one of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites. Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations  and see where they succeeded and where they failed. Use science to  you know  work backwards and say   Well  really  what were they thinking   And recently  I was in Easter Island  which is an incredibly beautiful place  and an incredibly mysterious place  because no matter where you go in Easter Island  you're struck by these statues  called the moai. The place is    square miles. They made  so far as we can tell      of them. Why on Earth  And if you haven't read Jared Diamond's book   Collapse   I totally recommend that you do. He's got a great chapter about it. Basically  these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of these. And somewhere along the line  somebody said   I know  Let's cut down the last tree and commit suicide  because we need more identical statues.  And  one thing that isn't a mystery  actually  was when I grew up    because when I was a little kid  I'd seen these pictures    and I thought   Well  why that look on the face  Why that brow   I mean  it's such a powerful thing. Where did they get that inspiration  And then I met Yoyo  who is the native Rapa Nui an guide  and if you look at Yoyo's face  you kind of figure out where they got it. There's many mysteries  these statues. Everyone wants to know  how did they make them  how did they transport them  This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg. She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today. And she has studied the statues for    some years  and she has detailed records of every single statue. The one on the page here is the same that's up there. One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard. So  this used to be completely smooth. In fact  in many of the statues  when you excavate them  the backs are totally smooth    almost glass smooth. But after       years out in the weather  they look like this. Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all  and we're going to do a very high res digitization  first because it's a way of preserving them. Second  we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically  then  learn a few of the mysteries about them. How long have they been standing in what positions  And maybe  indirectly  get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are. While I was in Easter Island  comet McNaught was there also  so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet. I also have an archaeological project going on in Egypt.  Going on  is perhaps a little bit strong. We're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set  to get it going. So  I'll talk about it at a future TED. But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well. Another thing I do is I invent stuff. In fact  I design nuclear reactors. Not a joke. This is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle. The red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle. The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle  where you reprocess. Now  this is the normal way it's done. It's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution. It has a lot of disadvantages  each one of these steps is extremely expensive  it's potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be performed in anyone's backyard  which is a problem. So  our reactor eliminates these steps  which  if we can actually make it work  is a really cool thing. Now  it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor. There's    no reactor's been even built to an old design  much less a new one  in the United States for    years. It's the kind of very high risk  but potentially very high return thing that we do. Changing into a totally different field  we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics  particularly in an area called metamaterials. A metamaterial is an artificial material  which manipulates  in this case  electromagnetic radiation  in a way that you couldn't otherwise. So  this device here is an invisibility cloak. It may not seem that  but if you were a microwave  this is how you would view it. Rays of light    in this case  microwave light    come in  and they just squish around the cell  and they come back the other side. Now  you could do that with mirrors from one angle. The cool thing is  this does it from all angles. Metamaterials  unfortunately    A  it only works on microwave  and B  it doesn't work all that well yet. But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field. It's    you know  today I'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business  but  in fact  it's negative. But some day  some day  maybe it's going to work. We do a lot of work in biomedical fields. In this case  we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries. So  they say the eyes are the windows of the soul    turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff. And these happen to be my eyes  by the way. Now  I'm also very interested in cooking. While I was at Microsoft  I took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in France. I used to work  also while at Microsoft  at a leading restaurant in Seattle  so I do a lot of cooking. I've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue. But barbecue's interesting  because it's one of these cult foods like chili  or bouillabaisse. Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to    there's tremendous traditions  there's secrecy. And I'm trying to use a very scientific approach. So  this is my latest cooker  and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor  that's because it is. But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials    and of course  really the controller over there does it all on software    you can make some terrific ribs. This is a high speed centrifuge. You should all have one in your kitchen  beside your Turbochef. This subjects food to a force about        times that of normal gravity  and oh boy  does it clarify chicken stock. You would not believe it  I perform a series of ghoulish experiments on food    in this case  trying to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking times are. It turns out  A  it's useful  and for a geek like me  it's fun. Theory is red  black is experiment. So  I'm either really good at faking it  or this particular model seems to work. So  another random thing I do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence  or SETI. And you may be familiar with the movie  Contact   which sort of popularized that. It turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way. In fact  almost everybody in the movie is based on a real character  a real person. So  the Jodie Foster character here is actually this woman  Jill Tarter  and Jill has dedicated her life to this. You know  a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism  which is kind of cool  but Jill has what I call slow heroism. She is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years    may not ever. So  I like to support people that are risking their lives. After the movie came out  of course  there was a lot of interest in SETI. My kids saw the movie  and afterwards they came to me and they said   So  Dad  so    so    that character    that's Jill  right   I said   Oh  yeah  yeah    absolutely.   And that other person  that's someone      I said   Yes.  They said   Well  you know that creepy rich guy in the movie  Is that you   I said   Well  you know  it's just a movie  Come on.  So  the SETI Institute  with a little bit of help from me  and a lot of help from Paul Allen and a variety of other people  is building a dedicated radio telescope in Hat Creek  California  so they can do this SETI work. Now  I travel a lot  and I change cell phones a lot  and the one person who always gets updated on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else is Jill  because I really don't want to miss  the call.  I mean  can you imagine  E.T.'s phoning home  and I'm not  like  there  You know  horrible  So  I do a lot of work on dinosaurs. I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs. And I resemble that remark. I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs  which is the finding of them. Now  to find dinosaurs  you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur. It sounds really dumb  but that's what it is. It's horrible conditions  because wherever you have nice weather  plants grow  and you don't get any erosion  and you don't see any dinosaurs. So  you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands  areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring. You know  skiers pray for snow  Paleontologists pray for erosion. So  you hike around and    this is after you dig them up  they look like this. You hike around  you see something like this. Now  this is something I found  so look at it very closely here. You've got this bentonite clay  which is    sort of swells up and expands. And there's some stuff poking out. So  you look at that  and you look up close  and you say   Well  gee  that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces   Well  if you look closely  you can recognize  actually  from the shape  that these are skull fragments. And then when you look at this  you say   That's a tooth. It's a big tooth.  It's about the size of a banana. It has a big serration on the edge. This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground. And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex  which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago. Now  this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room. Not the same one  actually. This is a cast  which I had bought  and then  after buying the cast  I found my own  and I don't have room for two. You know. So  the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing  because you're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago. It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways. The study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there's a problem with asteroid impact  for example. The study of dinosaurs may  literally  one day save the planet. Study of the ancient climate is very important. In fact  the Mesozoic  when dinosaurs lived  had much higher CO  than today  was much warmer than today  and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of CO  on climate. But  besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting  it's also very different than the other things I do  because you get to hike around in the badlands. This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like. This is one of my papers   A pygostyle from a non avian theropod.  It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex  so we're not going to go into it further. Now  I'm also really big on photography. I travel all over the world taking pictures    some of them good  most of them not. These days  bits are cheap. Unfortunately  that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them. Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands of king penguins on a beach. Here's a picture I took in Alaska  a few years ago  of Orcas. I'd gone up to photograph Orcas  and we had looked for a week  and we hadn't seen a damn Orca. And the last day  the sun comes out  the Orcas come  they're right by the boat. It's fantastic. And I get lots of pictures like this. Then  a little bit later  I start getting some pictures like this. Now  to a human audience  I need to explain that if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition  this would be the centerfold. It's true. So  there's more and more activity near the boat  and all of a sudden somebody shouts   What's that in the water   I said   Well  I think that's what you call a free willy.  There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex. The first thing you learn is the overwhelming importance of hands. They don't have them. I think Paul Simon is in the audience  and he has    he may not realize it  but he wrote a song all about whale sex   Slip Slidin' Away.  That's kind of what it's like. The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex  they curl their toes too. So    where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together  You know  there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing  passion in life  and focusing all your energy on it  and I've never been able to do that. I just    you know  because  yes  I'll focus passion on something  but then there will be something else  and then there's something else again. And for a long time I fought this  and I thought   Well  gee  I really ought to buckle down.  And you know  when I was at Microsoft  that was so engrossing  and the whole industry was expanding so much  that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life. But ultimately  I decided that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am  but embrace it. And say   Yeah  you know  I    this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep  but that's really what works for me.  And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex  the common    or lowest common denominator    is me. That's it  thank you. You know  culture was born of the imagination  and the imagination    the imagination as we know it    came into being when our species descended from our progenitor  Homo erectus  and  infused with consciousness  began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world. For a time  we shared the stage with our distant cousins  Neanderthal  who clearly had some spark of awareness  but    whether it was the increase in the size of the brain  or the development of language  or some other evolutionary catalyst    we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival. By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe         years ago  our direct ancestors had already  and for       years  been crawling into the belly of the earth  where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles  they had brought into being the great art of the Upper Paleolithic. And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France with the poet Clayton Eshleman  who wrote a beautiful book called  Juniper Fuse.  And you could look at this art and you could  of course  see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being. But more importantly  it spoke of a deeper yearning  something far more sophisticated than hunting magic. And the way Clayton put it was this way. He said   You know  clearly at some point  we were all of an animal nature  and at some point  we weren't.  And he viewed proto shamanism as a kind of original attempt  through ritual  to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost. So  he saw this art not as hunting magic  but as postcards of nostalgia. And viewed in that light  it takes on a whole other resonance. And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art is that as an aesthetic expression  it lasted for almost        years. If these were postcards of nostalgia  ours was a very long farewell indeed. And it was also the beginning of our discontent  because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the Paleolithic  it would come down to two words  how and why. And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged. Now  all people share the same raw  adaptive imperatives. We all have children. We all have to deal with the mystery of death  the world that waits beyond death  the elders who fall away into their elderly years. All of this is part of our common experience  and this shouldn't surprise us  because  after all  biologists have finally proven it to be true  something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true. And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters. We are all cut from the same genetic cloth. All of humanity  probably  is descended from a thousand people who left Africa roughly        years ago. But the corollary of that is that  if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material  all human populations share the same raw human genius  the same intellectual acuity. And so whether that genius is placed into    technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the West    or by contrast  into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth  is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation. There is no progression of affairs in human experience. There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so called primitives of the world. All peoples are simply cultural options  different visions of life itself. But what do I mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence  Well  let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere ever brought into being by the imagination  that of Polynesia.        square kilometers  tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea. I recently sailed on the Hokulea  named after the sacred star of Hawaii  throughout the South Pacific to make a film about the navigators. These are men and women who  even today  can name     stars in the night sky. These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls of islands beyond the visible horizon  simply by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their vessel  knowing full well that every island group in the Pacific has its unique refractive pattern that can be read with the same perspicacity with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint. These are sailors who in the darkness  in the hull of the vessel  can distinguish as many as    different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time  distinguishing local wave disturbances from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean  that can be followed with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea. Indeed  if you took all of the genius that allowed us to put a man on the moon and applied it to an understanding of the ocean  what you would get is Polynesia. And if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination  you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism. And I recently made a film called  The Buddhist Science of the Mind.  Why did we use that word  science  What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth  What is Buddhism but       years of empirical observation as to the nature of mind  I travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend  Matthieu Ricard  and you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us here once at TED   Western science is a major response to minor needs.  We spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be     without losing our teeth. The Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence. Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear. Their billboards are manuals  prayers to the well being of all sentient creatures. And with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche  we began a pilgrimage to a curious destination  accompanied by a great doctor. And the destination was a single room in a nunnery  where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat    years before. And en route  we took darshan from Rinpoche  and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths  the essence of the Buddhist path. All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative. It means things happen. The cause of suffering is ignorance. By that  the Buddha did not mean stupidity  he meant clinging to the illusion that life is static and predictable. The third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome. And the fourth and most important  of course  was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart  but had       years of empirical evidence that such a transformation was a certainty. And so  when this door opened onto the face of a woman who had not been out of that room in    years  you did not see a mad woman. You saw a woman who was more clear than a pool of water in a mountain stream. And of course  this is what the Tibetan monks told us. They said  at one point  you know  we don't really believe you went to the moon  but you did. You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime  but we do. And if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical  to the sacred geography of Peru    I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people that literally believe that the Earth is alive  responsive to all of their aspirations  all of their needs. And  of course  the human population has its own reciprocal obligations. I spent    years living amongst the people of Chinchero and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in. Once each year  the fastest young boy in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman. And for one day  he wears the clothing of his sister and he becomes a transvestite  a waylaka. And for that day  he leads all able bodied men on a run  but it's not your ordinary run. You start off at        feet. You run down to the base of the sacred mountain  Antakillqa. You run up to        feet  descend       feet. Climb again over the course of    hours. And of course  the waylakama spin  the trajectory of the route  is marked by holy mounds of Earth  where coke is given to the Earth  libations of alcohol to the wind  the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop. And the metaphor is clear  you go into the mountain as an individual  but through exhaustion  through sacrifice  you emerge as a community that has once again reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet. And at     I was the only outsider ever to go through this  only one to finish it. I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the       year history of the plant. But these localized rituals become pan Andean  and these fantastic festivals  like that of the Qoyllur Rit'i  which occurs when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky. It's kind of like an Andean Woodstock         Indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred valley  called the Sinakara  which is dominated by three tongues of the great glacier. The metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community  in this wonderful fusion of Christian and pre Columbian ideas. You place the cross into the ice  in the shadow of Ausangate  the most sacred of all Apus  or sacred mountains of the Inca. And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses. Now  these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to  like Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu was never a lost city. On the contrary  it was completely linked in to the        kilometers of royal roads the Inca made in less than a century. But more importantly  it was linked in to the Andean notions of sacred geography. The intiwatana  the hitching post to the sun  is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu  which is Sugarloaf Mountain  called Huayna Picchu. If you come to the south of the intiwatana  you find an altar. Climb Huayna Picchu  find another altar. Take a direct north south bearing  you find to your astonishment that it bisects the intiwatana stone  goes to the skyline  hits the heart of Salcantay  the second of the most important mountains of the Incan empire. And then beyond Salcantay  of course  when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky  directly in that same alignment  the Milky Way overhead. But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below  The sacred river  the Urubamba  or the Vilcanota  which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way  but it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being. And where does the river rise  Right on the slopes of the Koariti. So      years after Columbus  these ancient rhythms of landscape are played out in ritual. Now  when I was here at the first TED  I showed this photograph  two men of the Elder Brothers  the descendants  survivors of El Dorado. These  of course  are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization. If those of you who are here remember that I mentioned that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood  but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary. Taken from their families  sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for    years    two nine year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb. All that time  the world only exists as an abstraction  as they are taught the values of their society. Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers  and their prayers alone  maintain the cosmic balance. Now  the measure of a society is not only what it does  but the quality of its aspirations. And I always wanted to go back into these mountains  to see if this could possibly be true  as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist  Reichel Dolmatoff. So  literally two weeks ago  I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers on what was clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life. These really are a people who live and breathe the realm of the sacred  a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome. They consume more coca leaves than any human population  half a pound per man  per day. The gourd you see here is    everything in their lives is symbolic. Their central metaphor is a loom. They say   Upon this loom  I weave my life.  They refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient as  threads.  When they pray for the dead  they make these gestures with their hands  spinning their thoughts into the heavens. You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd. The gourd is a feminine aspect  the stick is a male. You put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes    well  they're not ashes  they're burnt limestone    to empower the coca leaf  to change the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride. But if you break a gourd  you cannot simply throw it away  because every stroke of that stick that has built up that calcium  the measure of a man's life  has a thought behind it. Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way  that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women. The other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically  you turn it on the side  and you have a piece of cloth. And they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization  the greatest goldsmiths of South America  who in the wake of the conquest  retreated into this isolated volcanic massif that soars to        feet above the Caribbean coastal plain. There are four societies  the Kogi  the Wiwa  the Kankwano and the Arhuacos. I traveled with the Arhuacos  and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man  Danilo Villafane    if we just jump back here for a second. When I first met Danilo  in the Colombian embassy in Washington  I couldn't help but say   You know  you look a lot like an old friend of mine.  Well  it turns out he was the son of my friend  Adalberto  from       who had been killed by the FARC. And I said   Danilo  you won't remember this  but when you were an infant  I carried you on my back  up and down the mountains.  And because of that  Danilo invited us to go to the very heart of the world  a place where no journalist had ever been permitted. Not simply to the flanks of the mountains  but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims. And this man sitting cross legged is now a grown up Eugenio  a man who I've known since     . And this is one of those initiates. No  it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for    years  but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men's circle for    years. This little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men's hut for all that time  until he begins his journey of initiation. For that entire time  the world only exists as an abstraction  as he is taught the values of society  including this notion that their prayers alone maintain the cosmic balance. Before we could begin our journey  we had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth. And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest. And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet    there must be nothing between the feet and the Earth for a mamo. And this is actually the place where the Great Mother sent the spindle into the world that elevated the mountains and created the homeland that they call the heart of the world. We traveled high into the paramo  and as we crested the hills  we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity. And then of course  as we reached our final destination  a place called Mamancana  we were in for a surprise  because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us. And so we ended up being taken aside into these huts  hidden away until the darkness. And then  abandoning all our gear  we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night  in a quite dramatic scene. It's going to look like a John Ford Western. And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn  so it was quite harrowing. It will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating is that the minute there was a sense of dangers  the mamos went into a circle of divination. And of course  this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hiding  as they divine their route to take us out of the mountains. We were able to  because we had trained people in filmmaking  continue with our work  and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film  and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea  taking the elements from the highlands to the sea. And here you see how their sacred landscape has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos  and yet  still they pray. And it's an amazing thing to think that this close to Miami  two hours from Miami  there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well being. They call themselves the Elder Brothers. They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the Earth. Now  if we slip to another end of the world  I was up in the high Arctic to tell a story about global warming  inspired in part by the former Vice President's wonderful book. And what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the Inuit    a people who don't fear the cold  but take advantage of it. A people who find a way  with their imagination  to carve life out of that very frozen. A people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death  but an affirmation of life. And yet tragically  when you now go to those northern communities  you find to your astonishment that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September and stay till July  in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland  it literally comes in now in November and stays until March. So  their entire year has been cut in half. Now  I want to stress that none of these peoples that I've been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds. These are not dying peoples. On the contrary  you know  if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see  you discover that the world is not flat. The world remains a rich tapestry. It remains a rich topography of the spirit. These myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being new  failed attempts at being modern. They're unique facets of the human imagination. They're unique answers to a fundamental question  what does it mean to be human and alive  And when asked that question  they respond with       different voices. And collectively  those voices become our human repertoire for dealing with the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. Our industrial society is scarcely     years old. That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us. They are unique answers to that fundamental question  what does it mean to be human and alive  And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth  taking with it not only plants and animals  but the legacy of humanity's brilliance. Right now  as we sit here in this room  of those       languages spoken the day that you were born  fully half aren't being taught to children. So  you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual  social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away. This does not have to happen. These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern    quaint and colorful and destined to fade away as if by natural law. In every case  these are dynamic  living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces. That's actually an optimistic observation  because it suggests that if human beings are the agents of cultural destruction  we can also be  and must be  the facilitators of cultural survival. Thank you very much. Last year  I told you the story  in seven minutes  of Project Orion  which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked  but it had this one year political window where it could have happened. So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen. This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing. This was a perfect introduction. And it's a story that did work. It did happen  and the machines are all around us. And it was a technology that was inevitable. If the people I'm going to tell you the story about  if they hadn't done it  somebody else would have. So  it was sort of the right idea at the right time. This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now. It's the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things  including changing biology. I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity  which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED  it brought a whole lot of very smart people together. And three of the smartest people were Stan Ulam  Richard Feynman and John von Neumann. And it was Von Neumann who said  after the bomb  he was working on something much more important than bombs  he's thinking about computers. So  he wasn't only thinking about them  he built one. This is the machine he built. He built this machine  and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works  with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back. The first person to really explain that was Thomas Hobbes  who  in       explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing  and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic  you can do it all with arithmetic. He said you needed addition and subtraction. Leibniz  who came a little bit later    this is         showed that you didn't even need subtraction. You could do the whole thing with addition. Here  we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution. And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine. He talked about doing it with marbles  having gates and what we now call shift registers  where you shift the gates  drop the marbles down the tracks. And that's what all these machines are doing  except  instead of doing it with marbles  they're doing it with electrons. And then we jump to Von Neumann        when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing. And       after the war  the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine. So June         actually  the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet    and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing  which also goes back to Turing  who  before that  gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless  little  finite state machine  just reading a tape in and reading a tape out. The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather. Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people  giving them each a little chunk  and putting it together. Here  we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will  but capable of only two ideas. And that's really the simplest computer. It's basically why you need the qubit  because it only has two ideas. And you put lots of those together  you get the essentials of the modern computer  the arithmetic unit  the central control  the memory  the recording medium  the input and the output. But  there's one catch. This is the fatal    you know  we saw it in starting these programs up. The instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail. So  the programming has to be perfect  or it won't work. If you look at the origins of this  the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here. But actually  the machine I'm going to tell you about  the Institute for Advanced Study machine  which is way up there  really should be down there. So  I'm trying to revise history  and give some of these guys more credit than they've had. Such a computer would open up universes  which are  at the present  outside the range of any instruments. So it opens up a whole new world  and these people saw it. The guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle  Vladimir Zworykin  from RCA. RCA  in probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time  decided not to go into computers. But the first meetings  November       were at RCA's offices. RCA started this whole thing off  and said  you know  televisions are the future  not computers. The essentials were all there    all the things that make these machines run. Von Neumann  and a logician  and a mathematician from the army put this together. Then  they needed a place to build it. When RCA said no  that's when they decided to build it in Princeton  where Freeman works at the Institute. That's where I grew up as a kid. That's me  that's my sister Esther  who's talked to you before  so we both go back to the birth of this thing. That's Freeman  a long time ago  and that was me. And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern  who wrote the  Theory of Games.  All these forces came together there  in Princeton. Oppenheimer  who had built the bomb. The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations. And Julian Bigelow  who took Zworkykin's place as the engineer  to actually figure out  using electronics  how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this  and women in front  who actually did most of the coding  were the first programmers. These were the prototype geeks  the nerds. They didn't fit in at the Institute. This is a letter from the director  concerned about     especially unfair on the matter of sugar.  You can read the text. This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time. These were not theoretical physicists. They were real soldering gun type guys  and they actually built this thing. And we take it for granted now  that each of these machines has billions of transistors  doing billions of cycles per second without failing. They were using vacuum tubes  very narrow  sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes. They actually used  J   the common radio tube  because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes. And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way. Reports were issued  so that this machine was cloned at    other places around the world. And it really was. It was the original microprocessor. All the computers now are copies of that machine. The memory was in cathode ray tubes    a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube    very  very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. So  there's    of these tubes  like a V    engine running the memory. The input and the output was by teletype tape at first. This is a wire drive  using bicycle wheels. This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now. Then they switched to a magnetic drum. This is modifying IBM equipment  which is the origins of the whole data processing industry  later at IBM. And this is the beginning of computer graphics. The  Graph'g Beam Turn On.  This next slide  that's the    as far as I know    the first digital bitmap display      . So  Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud  doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components. Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks  trying to get this thing to work  with all these       vacuum tubes that failed half the time. And that's what I've been doing  this last six months  is going through the logs.  Running time  two minutes. Input  output     minutes.  This includes a large amount of human error. So they are always trying to figure out  what's machine error  What's human error  What's code  what's hardware  That's an engineer gazing at tube number     trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus. He had to focus the memory    seems OK. So  he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running  let alone having  you know  software problems.  No use  went home.   Laughter   Impossible to follow the damn thing  where's a directory   So  already  they're complaining about the manuals   before closing down in disgust ...    The General Arithmetic  Operating Logs.  Burning lots of midnight oil.  MANIAC   which became the acronym for the machine  Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator   lost its memory.   MANIAC regained its memory  when the power went off.   Machine or human    Aha   So  they figured out it's a code problem.  Found trouble in code  I hope.   Code error  machine not guilty.   Damn it  I can be just as stubborn as this thing.   And the dawn came.  So they ran all night. Twenty four hours a day  this thing was running  mainly running bomb calculations.  Everything up to this point is wasted time.   What's the use  Good night.   Master control off. The hell with it. Way off.   Laughter   Something's wrong with the air conditioner    smell of burning V belts in the air.   A short    do not turn the machine on.   IBM machine putting a tar like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof.  So they really were working under tough conditions. Here   A mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack  set blower to vibrating. Result  no more mouse.   Here lies mouse. Born   . Died       a.m.  May     .  There's an inside joke someone has penciled in   Here lies Marston Mouse.  If you're a mathematician  you get that  because Marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there.  Picked a lightning bug off the drum.   Running at two kilocycles.  That's two thousand cycles per second     yes  I'm chicken     so two kilocycles was slow speed. The high speed was    kilocycles. I don't know if you remember a Mac that was    Megahertz  that's slow speed.  I have now duplicated both results. How will I know which is right  assuming one result is correct  This now is the third different output. I know when I'm licked.   We've duplicated errors before.   Machine run  fine. Code isn't.   Only happens when the machine is running.  And sometimes things are okay.  Machine a thing of beauty  and a joy forever.   Perfect running.   Parting thought  when there's bigger and better errors  we'll have them.  So  nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs. They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook  late one night  finally drew a bomb. So  that was the result. It was Mike  the first thermonuclear bomb  in     . That was designed on that machine  in the woods behind the Institute. So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos from all over the world to work on all these problems. Barricelli  he came to do what we now call  really  artificial life  trying to see if  in this artificial universe    he was a viral geneticist  way  way  way ahead of his time. He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now. Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer. Began    his universe started March    '  . So it's almost exactly    it's    years ago next Tuesday  I guess. And he saw everything in terms of    he could read the binary code straight off the machine. He had a wonderful rapport. Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him. Even errors were duplicated.  Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong  code is right.  So he designed this universe  and ran it. When the bomb people went home  he was allowed in there. He would run that thing all night long  running these things  if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram  who reinvented this stuff. And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared. It was published in the literature.  If it's that easy to create living organisms  why not create a few yourself   So  he decided to give it a try  to start this artificial biology going in the machines. And he found all these  sort of    it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny        byte universe  and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world  in biology. This is some of the generations of his universe. But they're just going to stay numbers  they're not going to become organisms. They have to have something. You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype. They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that  started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with    playing chess with other machines and so on. And they did start to evolve. And he went around the country after that. Every time there was a new  fast machine  he started using it  and saw exactly what's happening now. That the programs  instead of being turned off    when you quit the program  you'd keep running and  basically  all the sorts of things like Windows is doing  running as a multi cellular organism on many machines  he envisioned all that happening. And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process. It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence  but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence. And he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike  or a new kind of life. It just was another version of the same thing happening. And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago. And could you do it again now  So  when I went into these archives looking at this stuff  lo and behold  the archivist came up one day  saying   I think we found another box that had been thrown out.  And it was his universe on punch cards. So there it is     years later  sitting there    sort of suspended animation. That's the instructions for running    this is actually the source code for one of those universes  with a note from the engineers saying they're having some problems.  There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet.  And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity. What's the dividing line between when that is lifelike and when it really is alive  These cards  now  thanks to me showing up  are being saved. And the question is  should we run them or not  You know  could we get them running  Do you want to let it loose on the Internet  These machines would think they    these organisms  if they came back to life now    whether they've died and gone to heaven  there's a universe. My laptop is    thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project. He was thinking far ahead  to how this would really grow into a new kind of life. And that's what's happening  When Juan Enriquez told us about these    trillion bits being transferred back and forth  of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab  that's what Barricelli imagined  that this digital code in these machines is actually starting to code    it already is coding from nucleic acids. We've been doing that since  you know  since we started PCR and synthesizing small strings of DNA. And real soon  we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins  and  like Steve showed us  that just opens an entirely new world. It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned. This was published after he died  his sort of unfinished notes on self reproducing machines  what it takes to get the machines sort of jump started to where they begin to reproduce. It took really three people  Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing  Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines    that now  last count  four million of these Von Neumann machines is built every    hours  and Julian Bigelow  who died    days ago    this is John Markoff's obituary for him    he was the important missing link  the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work. And all our computers have  inside them  the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day  sort of on pencil and paper. And we owe a tremendous credit to that. And he explained  in a very generous way  the spirit that brought all these different people to the Institute for Advanced Study in the '  s to do this project  and make it freely available with no patents  no restrictions  no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world. That's the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down  July     . And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off. And that's the end. Thank you very much. My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously  on a collective level. And what I mean by that  it's the behaviors that we're in denial about  and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness. And as individuals  we all do these things  all the time  everyday. It's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else. Or when you drink a little too much at a party  just out of anxiety. Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt  or whatever. And when we do these kind of things  when     million people do unconscious behaviors  then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody wants  and no one intended. And that's what I look at with my photographic work. This is an image I just recently completed  that is    when you stand back at a distance  it looks like some kind of neo Gothic  cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution. And as you get a little bit closer  it starts looking like lots of pipes  like maybe a chemical plant  or a refinery  or maybe a hellish freeway interchange. And as you get all the way up close  you realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups. And in fact  this is one million plastic cups  which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the United States every six hours. We use four million cups a day on airline flights  and virtually none of them are reused or recycled. They just don't do that in that industry. Now  that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day  and that is    million cups a day for hot beverages  most of which is coffee. I couldn't fit    million cups on a canvas  but I was able to put        . That's what         cups looks like. That's    minutes of our cup consumption. And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life  that's the size it would be. And there's an hour's worth of our cups. And there's a day's worth of our cups. You can still see the little people way down there. That's as high as a    story building  and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference. Speaking of justice  there's another phenomenon going on in our culture that I find deeply troubling  and that is that America  right now  has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on Earth. One out of four people  one out of four humans in prison are Americans  imprisoned in our country. And I wanted to show the number. The number is  .  million Americans were incarcerated in     . And that's gone up since then  but we don't have the numbers yet. So  I wanted to show  .  million prison uniforms  and in the actual print of this piece  each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge. They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material  and to show  .  million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print. And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are    feet tall by    feet wide. This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York    those are my parents looking at the piece. Every time I look at this piece  I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad   He finally folded his laundry.  I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction. And this particular one is about cigarette addiction. I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who die from cigarette smoking. More than         people die in the United States every year from smoking cigarettes. And so  this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes. And  as you slowly step back  you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh  called  Skull with Cigarette.  It's a strange thing to think about  that on       when that tragedy happened        Americans died. And do you remember the response  It reverberated around the world  and will continue to reverberate through time. It will be something that we talk about in     years. And yet on that same day        Americans died from smoking. And the day after that  another       Americans died from smoking. And every single day since then        Americans have died. And today        Americans are dying from cigarette smoking. And we aren't talking about it    we dismiss it. The tobacco lobby  it's too strong. We just dismiss it out of our consciousness. And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes  we continue to allow our children  our sons and daughters  to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking. And this is what the next piece is about. This is just lots and lots of cigarettes         cigarettes  which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month  and every month in the U.S. More than         children in the United States aged    and under begin smoking every year. One more strange epidemic in the United States that I want to acquaint you with is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs. This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin. Well  actually  I only had one Vicodin that I scanned lots and lots of times. And so  as you stand back  you see         Vicodin pills  which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the United States  attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti anxiety medications. One third of all drug overdoses in the U.S.    and that includes cocaine  heroin  alcohol  everything    one third of drug overdoses are prescription medications. A strange phenomenon. This is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon  this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.         women  American women  last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery. It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift  given to young girls who are about to go off to college. So  I made this image out of Barbie dolls  and so  as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern  and as you get all the way back  you see        Barbie dolls  which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U.S. each month. The vast majority of those are on women under the age of   . And strangely enough  the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction  and most of that is being done by men. Now  I want to emphasize that these are just examples. I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues. They're just examples. And the reason that I do this  it's because I have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now. There's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment. We've lost our sense of outrage  our anger and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now  what's going on in our country  the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world. They've gone missing  these feelings have gone missing. Our cultural joy  our national joy is nowhere to be seen. And one of the causes of this  I think  is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview  this holoptical worldview  this holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the interconnection of things  the environmental footprints       miles away of the things that we buy  the social consequences        miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers. As we try to build this view  and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture  the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers  numbers in the millions  in the hundreds of millions  in the billions and now in the trillions. Bush's new budget is in the trillions  and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend. We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics. And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work  is to take these numbers  these statistics from the raw language of data  and to translate them into a more universal visual language  that can be felt. Because my belief is  if we can feel these issues  if we can feel these things more deeply  then they'll matter to us more than they do now. And if we can find that  then we'll be able to find  within each one of us  what it is that we need to find to face the big question  which is  how do we change  That  to me  is the big question that we face as a people right now  how do we change  How do we change as a culture  and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of  and that is our own behavior  My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues. I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way. I'm simply saying  this is who we are right now. And if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture  then we have a choice. The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface  to bring to this question  the depth of character that we can summon  as we show up for the question of how do we change    it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation  and it will continue to do that  on into the future. And it will profoundly affect the well being  the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions. I'm not speaking abstractly about this  I'm speaking    this is who we are in this room  right now  in this moment. Thank you and good afternoon. One way to change our genes is to make new ones  as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown. Another is to change our lifestyles. And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be  that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits. When you eat healthier  manage stress  exercise and love more  your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen. But more than that  your brain gets measurably bigger. Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now. This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us. Now  there's some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells. Some of my favorite things  like chocolate and tea  blueberries  alcohol in moderation  stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana. I'm just the messenger. What were we just talking about  And other things that can make it worse  that can cause you to lose brain cells. The usual suspects  like saturated fat and sugar  nicotine  opiates  cocaine  too much alcohol and chronic stress. Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle  so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much. Your heart gets more blood flow. We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease. That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left  after only a year become measurably less clogged. And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left  the blue means no blood flow. A year later    orange and white is maximum blood flow. We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and  by extension  breast cancer  simply by making these changes. We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited    percent in the group that made these changes  whereas only nine percent in the comparison group. These differences were highly significant. Even your sexual organs get more blood flow  so you increase sexual potency. One of the most effective anti smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services  showing that nicotine  which constricts your arteries  can cause a heart attack or a stroke  but it also causes impotence. Half of guys who smoke are impotent. How sexy is that  Now we're also about to publish a study    the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer. This is what's called a heat map    and the different colors    and along the side  on the right  are different genes. And we found that over     genes were favorably changed    in effect  turning on the good genes  the disease preventing genes  turning off the disease promoting genes. And so these findings I think are really very powerful  giving many people new hope and new choices. And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and   andMe  that are giving you your genetic profiles  are giving some people a sense of   Gosh  well  what can I do about it   Well  our genes are not our fate  and if we make these changes    they're a predisposition    but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise  we can actually change how our genes are expressed. Thank you. Welcome. If I could have the first slide  please  Contrary to calculations made by some engineers  bees can fly  dolphins can swim  and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces. Now  what I want to do  in the short time I have  is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature's design. I get to do this all the time  and it's just incredible. I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation. The challenge of looking at nature's designs    and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it  and the way we've used it. The challenge  of course  is to answer this question  what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere  And if we could figure that out  how can we implement those designs  Well  many biologists will tell engineers  and others  organisms have millions of years to get it right  they're spectacular  they can do everything wonderfully well. So  the answer is bio mimicry  just copy nature directly. We know from working on animals that the truth is that's exactly what you don't want to do    because evolution works on the just good enough principle  not on a perfecting principle. And the constraints in building any organism  when you look at it  are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints. Think about it. If you were an engineer and I told you that you had to build an automobile  but it had to start off to be this big  then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way. Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile  I'll tell you that you also    inside it    have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile. And you can absolutely never  absolutely never  because of history and the inherited plan  start with a clean slate. So  organisms have this important history. Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer. And this is really important when you begin to look at animals. Instead  we believe you need to be inspired by biology. You need to discover the general principles of nature  and then use these analogies when they're advantageous. This is a real challenge to do this  because animals  when you start to really look inside them    how they work    appear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history of the design plans  you can't go look it up anywhere. They have way too many motions for their joints  too many muscles. Even the simplest animal we think of  something like an insect  and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine. How can you make sense of this  Well  we believed    and we hypothesized    that one way animals could work simply  is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves. What we discovered was that two   four   six  and eight legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move. They all work like this kangaroo  they bounce. And they can be modeled by a spring mass system that we call the spring mass system because we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick. They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true  Well  a human  one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog  or works like three legs  together as one  of a trotting insect  or four legs as one of a trotting crab. And then they alternate in their propulsion  but the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way    you'll see next week  I'll give you a hint  there'll be an article coming out that says that really big things like T. rex probably couldn't do this  but you'll see that next week. Now  what's interesting is the animals  then    we said    bounce along the vertical plane this way  and in our collaborations with Pixar  in  A Bug's Life   we discussed the bipedal nature of the characters of the ants. And we told them  of course  they move in another plane as well. And they asked us this question. They say   Why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane  when you're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane   This is a good question. Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way. We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs  we collapsed them down as one. We got some of the best mathematicians in the world from Princeton to work on this problem. And we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down  but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time. And many organisms fit this kind of pattern. Now  why is this important to have this model  Because it's very interesting. When you take this model and you perturb it  you give it a push  as it bumps into something  it self stabilizes  with no brain or no reflexes  just by the structure alone. It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics. That's enough  The animals  when you look at them running  appear to be self stabilizing like this  using basically springy legs. That is  the legs can do computations on their own  the control algorithms  in a sense  are embedded in the form of the animal itself. Why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries  Well  I would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies  at least they have been so far. Think about the typical kind of robot that you see. Human technologies have tended to be large  flat  with right angles  stiff  made of metal. They have rolling devices and axles. There are very few motors  very few sensors. Whereas nature tends to be small  and curved  and it bends and twists  and has legs instead  and appendages  and has many muscles and many  many sensors. So it's a very different design. However  what's changing  what's really exciting    and I'll show you some of that next    is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature  then nature really can become a much more useful teacher. And here's one example that's really exciting. This is a collaboration we have with Stanford. And they developed this new technique  called Shape Deposition Manufacturing. It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like  and put in the material properties. They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself. For example  here's a leg  the clear part is stiff  the white part is compliant  and you don't need any axles there or anything. It just bends by itself beautifully. So  you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off this design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl. Our work has also inspired another robot  a biologically inspired bouncing robot  from the University of Michigan and McGill named RHex  for robot hexapod  and this one's autonomous. Let's go to the video  and let me show you some of these animals moving and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries. Here's what some of you did this morning  although you did it outside  not on a treadmill. Here's what we do. This is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach you think you don't have in your kitchen. This is an eight legged scorpion  six legged ant  forty four legged centipede. Now  I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks    they're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that in this ghost crab  from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina. It goes up to four meters per second when it runs. It actually leaps into the air  and has aerial phases when it does it  like a horse  and you'll see it's bouncing here. What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like Richard  or a cockroach  or a crab  or a kangaroo  the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far. Now  what good are springy legs then  What can they do  Well  we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability. So  we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we're looking at. And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did. The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down  It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all. We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple  springy legs  you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built. Here's the first example of that. This is the Stanford Shape Deposition Manufactured robot  named Sprawl. It has six legs    there are the tuned  springy legs. It moves in a gait that an insect uses  and here it is going on the treadmill. Now  what's important about this robot  compared to other robots  is that it can't see anything  it can't feel anything  it doesn't have a brain  yet it can maneuver over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever. It's this technique of building the properties into the form. This is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project    very robust  if a graduate student does that to his thesis project. This is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex  making its first outing in a demo. Same principle  it only has six moving parts  six motors  but it has springy  tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect. It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front  and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod  and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal. Robert Full  It'll go on different surfaces    here's sand    although we haven't perfected the feet yet  but I'll talk about that later. Here's RHex entering the woods. Again  this robot can't see anything  it can't feel anything  it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system  with very simple parts  but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal. I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA  and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice  and life  ultimately  on Mars. And he said    especially with legged robots  because they're way too complicated. Nothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video with the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them we should go to Mars in       I tinted the video orange just to give them the sense of being on Mars. Another reason why animals have extraordinary performance  and can go anywhere  is because they have an effective interaction with the environment. The animal I'm going to show you  that we studied to look at this  is the gecko. We have one here and notice its position. It's holding on. Now I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video. One of the animals is going to be running on the level  and the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which  They're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left is running up the wall  Okay. The point is it's really hard to tell  isn't it  It's incredible  we looked at students do this and they couldn't tell. They can run up a wall at a meter a second     steps per second  and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this  It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill. How do they do this  They have bizarre toes. They have toes that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out  and then peel off the surface  like tape. Like if we had a piece of tape now  we'd peel it this way. They do this with their toes. It's bizarre  This peeling inspired iRobot    that we work with    to build Mecho Geckos. Here's a legged version and a tractor version  or a bulldozer version. Let's see some of the geckos move with some video  and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots. Here's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes  in real time. There it goes again. Obviously  we have to slow this down a little bit. You can't use regular cameras. You have to take       pictures per second to see this. And here's some video at       frames per second. Now  I want you to look at the animal's back. Do you see how much it's bending like that  We can't figure that out    that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works. If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley  come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay  send them to Berkeley because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill. It's a see through treadmill with a see through treadmill belt  so we can watch the animal's feet  and videotape them through the treadmill belt  to see how they move. Here's the animal that we have here  running on a vertical surface. Pick a foot and try to watch a toe  and see if you can see what the animal's doing. See it uncurl and then peel these toes. It can do this in    milliseconds. It's unbelievable. Here are the robots that they inspire  the Mecho Geckos from iRobot. First we'll see the animals toes peeling    look at that. And here's the peeling action of the Mecho Gecko. It uses a pressure sensitive adhesive to do it. Peeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho Gecko    that allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface  transition to a wall  and then go onto a ceiling. There's the bulldozer version. Now  it doesn't use pressure sensitive glue. The animal does not use that. But that's what we're limited to  at the moment. What does the animal do  The animal has weird toes. And if you look at the toes  they have these little leaves there  and if you blow them up and zoom in  you'll see that's there's little striations in these leaves. And if you zoom in     times  you'll see it looks like a rug. And if you blow that up  and zoom in     times  you see there are hairs there  tiny hairs. And if you look carefully  those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those        times  you'll see each hair has split ends. And if you blow those up  they have these little structures on the end. The smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae  and an animal like that has one billion of these nano size split ends  to get very close to the surface. In fact  there's the diameter of your hair    a gecko has two million of these  and each hair has     to       split ends. Think of the contact of that that's possible. We were fortunate to work with another group at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor  that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair. Here's an individual hair with a little split end there. When we measured the forces  they were enormous. They were so large that a patch of hairs about this size    the gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child  about    pounds  easily. Now  how do they do it  We've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction  No  force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics  No  you can change the charge    they still hold on. Do they do it by interlocking  That's kind of a like a Velcro like thing. No  you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces    they don't do it. How about suction  They stick on in a vacuum. How about wet adhesion  Or capillary adhesion  They don't have any glue  and they even stick under water just fine. If you put their foot under water  they grab on. How do they do it then  Believe it or not  they grab on by intermolecular forces  by Van der Waals forces. You know  you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry  where you had these two atoms  they're close together  and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times with these small structures. What we're doing is  we're taking that inspiration of the hairs  and with another colleague at Berkeley  we're manufacturing them. And just recently we've made a breakthrough  where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic  self cleaning  dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this. We also presented to Nike even. We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this that we realized that that small size scale    and where everything gets sticky  and gravity doesn't matter anymore    we needed to look at ants and their feet  because one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six millimeter silicone robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well. But the ants do  and we'll figure out why  so that ultimately we'll make this move. And imagine  you're going to be able to have swarms of these six millimeter robots available to run around. Where's this going  I think you can see it already. Clearly  the Internet is already having eyes and ears  you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands. You're going to be able to do programmable work through these kinds of robots  so that you can run  fly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish. So  in conclusion  I think the message is clear. If you need a message  if nature's not enough  if you care about search and rescue  or mine clearance  or medicine  or the various things we're working on  we must preserve nature's designs  otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. Thank you. This is a work in process  based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine.  .  billion people don't have access to electricity  refrigeration or stored fuels. This is a problem. It impacts  the spread of disease  the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life. So here's the plan  inexpensive refrigeration that doesn't use electricity  propane  gas  kerosene or consumables. Time for some thermodynamics. And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator. Adam Grosser  So    years ago  I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration. It's one of those things that stuck in my head. It was a lot like the Stirling engine  it was cool  but you didn't know what to do with it. And it was invented in       by this guy Ferdinand Carre  but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time. This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in       and it was a really neat idea  and I'll get to why it didn't work  but here's how it works. There's two spheres and they're separated in distance. One has a working fluid  water and ammonia  and the other is a condenser. You heat up one side  the hot side. The ammonia evaporates and it re condenses in the other side. You let it cool to room temperature  and then  as the ammonia re evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side  it creates a powerful cooling effect. So  it was a great idea that didn't work at all  it blew up. Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong. It topped     psi. The ammonia was toxic. It sprayed everywhere. But it was kind of an interesting thought. So  the great thing about      is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. So  we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved    a lot of computational fluid dynamics. We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong. We found some non toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures. Brought in a team from the U.K.    there's a lot of great refrigeration people  it turned out  in the U.K.    and built a test rig  and proved that  in fact  we could make a low pressure  non toxic refrigerator. So  this is the way it works. You put it on a cooking fire. Most people have cooking fires in the world  whether it's camel dung or wood. It heats up for about    minutes  cools for an hour. Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for    hours. It looks like this. This is the fifth prototype. It's not quite done. Weighs about eight pounds  and this is the way it works. You put it into a    liter vessel  about three gallons  and it'll cool it down to just above freezing    three degrees above freezing    for    hours in a    degree C environment. It's really cheap. We think we can build these in high volumes for about    dollars  in low volumes for about    dollars. And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have. Thank you. Once upon a time  there was a dread disease that afflicted children. And in fact  among all the diseases that existed in this land  it was the worst. It killed the most children. And along came a brilliant inventor  a scientist  who came up with a partial cure for that disease. And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died  but it was certainly better than what they had before. And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free  virtually free  and was very easy to use. But the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it on the youngest children  on infants  and on one year olds. And so  as a consequence  a few years later  another scientist    perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him  but building on the invention of the first one    came up with a second cure. And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one year olds. And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive  and it was very complicated to use. And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly  almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end. But what they did  of course  since it was so complicated and expensive  they only used it on the zero year olds and the one year olds. And they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two year olds and up. And this went on for quite some time. People were happy. They had their two cures. Until a particular mother  whose child had just turned two  died of this disease. And she thought to herself   My child just turned two  and until the child turned two  I had always used this complicated  expensive cure  you know  this treatment. And then the child turned two  and I started using the cheap and easy treatment  and I wonder     and she wondered  like all parents who lose children wonder     if there isn't something that I could have done  like keep on using that complicated  expensive cure.  And she told all the other people  and she said   How could it possibly be that something that's cheap and simple works as well as something that's complicated and expensive   And the people thought   You know  you're right. It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution.  And the government  they heard her story and the other people  and they said   Yeah  you're right  we should make a law. We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children.  And the people were happy. They were satisfied. For many years this went along  and everything was fine. But then along came a lowly economist  who had children himself  and he used the expensive and complicated treatment. But he knew about the cheap and simple one. And he thought about it  and the expensive one didn't seem that great to him. So he thought   I don't know anything about science  but I do know something about data  so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one.  And lo and behold  when he went through the data  he found that it didn't look like the expensive  complicated solution was any better than the cheap one  at least for the children who were two and older    the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger. And so  he went forth to the people and he said   I've made this wonderful finding  it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution  and by doing so we could save ourselves     million dollars a year  and we could spend that on our children in other ways.  And the parents were very unhappy  and they said   This is a terrible thing  because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing   And the government was very upset. And in particular  the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought   How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free  We would lose all of our market.  And people were very angry  and they called him horrible names. And he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days  and seek out some more intelligent  open minded people in a place called Oxford  and come and try and tell the story at that place. And so  anyway  here I am. It's not a fairy tale. It's a true story about the United States today  and the disease I'm referring to is actually motor vehicle accidents for children. And the free cure is adult seatbelts  and the expensive cure    the     million dollar a year cure    is child car seats. And what I'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why I believe this to be true  that for children two years old and up  there really is no real benefit    proven benefit    of car seats  in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why    what is it that makes that true  And then  finally talk a little bit about a third way  about another technology  which is probably better than anything we have  but which    there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution. OK. So  many times when you try to do research on data  it records complicated stories    it's hard to find in the data. It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats. So the United States keeps a data set of every fatal accident that's happened since     . So in every car crash in which at least one person dies  they have information on all of the people. So if you look at that data    it's right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's website    you can just look at the raw data  and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up. So  here is the data. Here I have  among two  to six year olds    anyone above six  basically no one uses car seats  so you can't compare      .  percent of the children who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies  themselves die. If you put a child in a car seat    .  percent of the children die. If they're wearing a lap and shoulder belt  in this raw data    .  percent die. And interestingly  wearing a lap only seatbelt    .  percent die. And actually  the theory tells you that the lap only seatbelt's got to be worse than the lap and shoulder belt. And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data  there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way. So what we do in the study is    and this is just presenting the same information  but turned into a figure to make it easier. So the yellow bar represents car seats  the orange bar lap and shoulder  and the red bar lap only seatbelts. And this is all relative to unrestrained    the bigger the bar  the better. Okay. So  this is the data I just showed  OK  So the highest bar is what you're striving to beat. So you can control for the basic things  like how hard the crash was  what seat the child was sitting in  etc.  the age of the child. And that's that middle set of bars. And so  you can see that the lap only seatbelts start to look worse once you do that. And then finally  the last set of bars  which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash              different characteristics of the crash. And what you find is that the car seats and the lap and shoulder belts  when it comes to saving lives  fatalities look exactly identical. And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well. And it's not just overall. It's very robust to anything you want to look at. One thing that's interesting  if you look at frontal impact crashes    when the car crashes  the front hits into something    indeed  what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better. And I think this isn't just chance. In order to have the car seat approved  you need to pass certain federal standards  all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash. But when you look at other types of crashes  like rear impact crashes  indeed  the car seats don't perform as well. And I think that's because they've been optimized to pass  as we always expect people to do  to optimize relative to bright line rules about how affected the car will be. And the other thing you might argue is   Well  car seats have got a lot better over time. And so if we look at recent crashes    the whole data set is almost    years' worth of data    you won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far  far better.  But indeed  in recent crashes the lap and shoulder seatbelts  actually  are doing even better than the car seats. They say   Well  that's impossible  that can't be.  And the line of argument  if you ask parents  is   But car seats are so expensive and complicated  and they have this big tangle of latches  how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated   It's kind of an interesting logic  I think  that people use. And the other logic  they say   Well  the government wouldn't have told us  to  use them if they weren't much better.  But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much. It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two  which has led to the passage of all these laws    not very much on data. So you can only get so far  I think  in telling your story by using these abstract statistics. And so I had some friends over to dinner  and I was asking    we had a cookout    I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point. They said   Why don't you run some crash tests   And I said   That's a great idea.  So we actually tried to commission some crash tests. And it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country  none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said  some explicitly  some not so explicitly   All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers. We can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats.  Now  eventually  one did. Under the conditions of anonymity  they said they would be happy to do this test for us    so anonymity  and       dollars per seat that we crashed. And so  we went to Buffalo  New York  and here is the precursor to it. These are the crash test dummies  waiting for their chance to take the center stage. And then  here's how the crash test works. Here  they don't actually crash the entire car  you know    it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it. So they just have these bench seats  and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it. So I just wanted you to look at this. And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat. Does he not look content  ready to go  like he could survive anything  And then  if you look at the kid in back  it looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens. It's hard to believe  when you look at this  that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash. So this is going to be a crash where they're going to slam this thing forward into a wall at    miles an hour  and see what happens. OK  So  let me show you what happens. These are three year old dummies  by the way. So here    this is the car seat. Now watch two things  watch how the head goes forward  and basically hits the knees    and this is in the car seat    and watch how the car seat flies around  in the rebound  up in the air. The car seat's moving all over the place. Bear in mind there are two things about this. This is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed       car seats  who knew exactly how to do it. And also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way to install car seats. Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them. And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat  OK  So  that kid in this crash fared very well. The federal standards are that you have to score below a       to be an approved car seat on this crash  in some metric of units which are not important. And this crash would have been about a    . So this car seat was actually an above average car seat from Consumer Reports  and did quite well. So the next one. Now  this is the kid  same crash  who is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all  actually  relative to the other child. The funny thing is  the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up to do the car seats  and so  they actually don't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound. Anyway  it turns out that those two crashes  that actually the three year old did slightly worse. So  he gets about a     out of    you know  on this range    relative to a     and something. But still  if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government  and said   I have invented a new car seat. I would like you to approve it for selling   then they would say   This is a fantastic new car seat  it works great. It only got a      it could have gotten as high up as a      .  And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat. So  in some sense  what this is suggesting is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong  which is putting children at risk. It's just that  fundamentally  the car seats aren't doing much. So here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time  so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat    at rebound  it takes a lot longer    but there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt. So  I'll show you the six year old crashes as well. The six year old is in a car seat  and it turns out that looks terrible  but that's great. That's like a      OK  So that kid would do fine in the crash. Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all. And then here's the six year old in the seatbelt  and in fact  they get exactly within  you know  within one or two points of the same. So really  for the six year old  the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever. That's some more evidence  so in some sense    I was criticized by a scientist  who said   You could never publish a study with an n of     meaning those four crashes. So I wrote him back and I said   What about an n of          Because I had the other        other real world crashes. And I just think that it's interesting that the idea of using real world crashes  which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do  is something that scientists don't actually  usually think    they would rather use a laboratory  a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies  than actually    years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats. And so I think the answer to this puzzle is that there's a much better solution out there  that's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working. And if you think from a design perspective  about going back to square one  and say   I just want to protect kids in the back seat.  I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say   Well  the right way to start would be  let's make a great seat belt for adults. And then  let's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain.  I mean  why not start    who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids  But essentially  do something like this  which I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do  but there's no reason I could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat. It's just actually    you see  this is folding up    it's behind the seat. You've got a regular seat for adults  and then you fold it down  and the kid sits on top  and it's integrated. It seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution  and it's got to work better than what we already have. So the question is  is there any hope for adoption of something like this  which would presumably save a lot of lives  And I think the answer  perhaps  lies in a story. The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful  and why this may someday be adopted or not  lies in a story that my dad told me  relating to when he was a doctor in the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago  you were allowed to do things then you can't do today. So  my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick. And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them  and he'd say   Come back in a week  if you still feel lousy.  OK  and most of them would not come back  but some of them would come back. And when they came back  he  still convinced they were not sick  had another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills. They were almost impossible to swallow. And these  to me  are the analogy for the car seats. People would look at these and say   Man  this thing is so big and so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better  you know  what possibly could   And it turned out that most people wouldn't come back  because it worked. But every once in a while  there was still a patient convinced that he was sick  and he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills. And the jar of pills he had  he said  were the tiniest little pills he could find  so small you could barely see them. And he would say  listen  I know I gave you that huge pill  that complicated  hard to swallow pill before  but now I've got one that's so potent  that is really tiny and small and almost invisible. It's almost like this thing here  which you can't even see.  And it turned out that never  in all the times my dad gave out this pill  the really tiny pill  did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness. So  my dad always took that as evidence that this little  teeny  powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense  if that's the right story  I think integrated car seats you will see  very quickly  becoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusion is  well  maybe after coming to my father three times  getting sent home with placebos  he still felt sick  he went and found another doctor. And that's completely possible. And if that's the case  then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come. Thank you very much. we don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life  it's also to prevent lots of serious injury. Your data looks at fatalities. It doesn't look at serious injury. Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective  or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury  Because that would prove your case.  Steven Levitt  Yeah  that's a great question. In my data  and in another data set I've looked at for New Jersey crashes  I find very small differences in injury. So in this data  it's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap and shoulder belts. In the New Jersey data  which is different  because it's not just fatal crashes  but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported  it turns out that there is a    percent difference in injuries  but generally they're the minor injuries. Now  what's interesting  I should say this as a disclaimer  there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data  which suggests that car seats are dramatically better. And they use a completely different methodology that involves    after the crash occurs  they get from the insurance companies the names of the people who were in the crash  and they call them on the phone  and they asked them what happened. And I really can't resolve  yet  and I'd like to work with these medical researchers to try to understand how there can be these differences  which are completely at odds with one another. But it's obviously a critical question. The question is even if    are there enough serious injuries to make these cost effective  It's kind of tricky. Even if they're right  it's not so clear that they're so cost effective. Probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the     s. They were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes  and they wrote telegrams back to Manchester. And one of them wrote   Situation hopeless. Stop. They don't wear shoes.  And the other one wrote   Glorious opportunity. They don't have any shoes yet.  Now  there's a similar situation in the classical music world  because there are some people who think that classical music is dying. And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet. And rather than go into statistics and trends  and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing  and the record companies that are folding  I thought we should do an experiment tonight. Actually  it's not really an experiment  because I know the outcome. But it's like an experiment. Now  before we start    Before we start  I need to do two things. One is I want to remind you of what a seven year old child sounds like when he plays the piano. Maybe you have this child at home. He sounds something like this. I see some of you recognize this child. Now  if he practices for a year and takes lessons  he's now eight and he sounds like this. He practices for another year and takes lessons    he's nine. Then he practices for another year and takes lessons    now he's   . At that point  they usually give up. Now  if you'd waited for one more year  you would have heard this. Now  what happened was not maybe what you thought  which is  he suddenly became passionate  engaged  involved  got a new teacher  he hit puberty  or whatever it is. What actually happened was the impulses were reduced. You see  the first time  he was playing with an impulse on every note. And the second  with an impulse every other note. You can see it by looking at my head. The nine year old put an impulse on every four notes. The    year old  on every eight notes. And the    year old  one impulse on the whole phrase. I don't know how we got into this position. I didn't say   I'm going to move my shoulder over  move my body.  No  the music pushed me over  which is why I call it one buttock playing. It can be the other buttock. You know  a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing  when I was working with a young pianist. He was the president of a corporation in Ohio. I was working with this young pianist  and said   The trouble with you is you're a two buttock player. You should be a one buttock player.  I moved his body while he was playing. And suddenly  the music took off. It took flight. The audience gasped when they heard the difference. Then I got a letter from this gentleman. He said   I was so moved. I went back and I transformed my entire company into a one buttock company.  Now  the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you. There are       people  I believe. My estimation is that probably    of you are absolutely passionate about classical music. You adore classical music. Your FM is always on that classical dial. You have CDs in your car  and you go to the symphony  your children are playing instruments. You can't imagine your life without classical music. That's the first group  quite small. Then there's another bigger group. The people who don't mind classical music. You know  you've come home from a long day  and you take a glass of wine  and you put your feet up. A little Vivaldi in the background doesn't do any harm. That's the second group. Now comes the third group  people who never listen to classical music. It's just simply not part of your life. You might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport ...    and maybe a little bit of a march from  Aida  when you come into the hall. But otherwise  you never hear it. That's probably the largest group. And then there's a very small group. These are the people who think they're tone deaf. Amazing number of people think they're tone deaf. Actually  I hear a lot   My husband is tone deaf.  Actually  you cannot be tone deaf. Nobody is tone deaf. If you were tone deaf  you couldn't change the gears on your car  in a stick shift car. You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome. And the telephone. The telephone. If your mother calls on the miserable telephone  she calls and says   Hello   you not only know who it is  you know what mood she's in. You have a fantastic ear. Everybody has a fantastic ear. So nobody is tone deaf. But I tell you what. It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing  with such a wide gulf between those who understand  love and are passionate about classical music  and those who have no relationship to it at all. The tone deaf people  they're no longer here. But even between those three categories  it's too wide a gulf. So I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room  downstairs and in Aspen  and everybody else looking  will come to love and understand classical music. So that's what we're going to do. Now  you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work  if you look at my face  right  It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming. Imagine if Martin Luther King had said   I have a dream. Of course  I'm not sure they'll be up to it.  All right. So I'm going to take a piece of Chopin. This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin. Some of you will know it. Do you know what I think probably happened here  When I started  you thought   How beautiful that sounds.   I don't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year.  It's funny  isn't it  It's funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head. And of course    Of course  if the piece is long and you've had a long day  you might actually drift off. Then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say   Wake up  It's culture   And then you feel even worse. But has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you  but because of us  Did anybody think while I was playing   Why is he using so many impulses   If I'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it. And for the rest of your life  every time you hear classical music  you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses. So let's see what's really going on here. We have a B. This is a B. The next note is a C. And the job of the C is to make the B sad. And it does  doesn't it  Composers know that. If they want sad music  they just play those two notes. But basically  it's just a B  with four sads. Now  it goes down to A. Now to G. And then to F. So we have B  A  G  F. And if we have B  A  G  F  what do we expect next  That might have been a fluke. Let's try it again. Oh  the TED choir. And you notice nobody is tone deaf  right  Nobody is. You know  every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China    everybody knows  da  da  da  da    da. Everybody knows  who's expecting that E. Chopin didn't want to reach the E there  because what will have happened  It will be over  like Hamlet. Do you remember  Act One  scene three  he finds out his uncle killed his father. He keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him. And then he backs away  he goes up to him again  almost kills him. The critics sitting in the back row there  they have to have an opinion  so they say   Hamlet is a procrastinator.  Or they say   Hamlet has an Oedipus complex.  No  otherwise the play would be over  stupid. That's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet    Ophelia going mad  the play within the play  and Yorick's skull  and the gravediggers. That's in order to delay    until Act Five  he can kill him. It's the same with the Chopin. He's just about to reach the E  and he says   Oops  better go back up and do it again.  So he does it again. Now  he gets excited. That's excitement  don't worry about it. Now  he gets to F sharp  and finally he goes down to E  but it's the wrong chord    because the chord he's looking for is this one  and instead he does ... Now  we call that a deceptive cadence  because it deceives us. I tell my students   If you have a deceptive cadence  raise your eyebrows  and everybody will know.  Right. He gets to E  but it's the wrong chord. Now  he tries E again. That chord doesn't work. Now  he tries the E again. That chord doesn't work. Now  he tries E again  and that doesn't work. And then finally ... There was a gentleman in the front row who went   Mmm.  It's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day  turns off the key in his car and says   Aah  I'm home.  Because we all know where home is. So this is a piece which goes from away to home. I'm going to play it all the way through and you're going to follow. B  C  B  C  B  C  B    down to A  down to G  down to F. Almost goes to E  but otherwise the play would be over. He goes back up to B  he gets very excited. Goes to F sharp. Goes to E. It's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord. And finally goes to E  and it's home. And what you're going to see is one buttock playing. Because for me  to join the B to the E  I have to stop thinking about every single note along the way  and start thinking about the long  long line from B to E. You know  we were just in South Africa  and you can't go to South Africa without thinking of Mandela in jail for    years. What was he thinking about  Lunch  No  he was thinking about the vision for South Africa and for human beings. This is about vision. This is about the long line. Like the bird who flies over the field and doesn't care about the fences underneath  all right  So now  you're going to follow the line all the way from B to E. And I've one last request before I play this piece all the way through. Would you think of somebody who you adore  who's no longer there  A beloved grandmother  a lover    somebody in your life who you love with all your heart  but that person is no longer with you. Bring that person into your mind  and at the same time  follow the line all the way from B to E  and you'll hear everything that Chopin had to say. Now  you may be wondering    You may be wondering why I'm clapping. Well  I did this at a school in Boston with about    seventh graders     year olds. I did exactly what I did with you  and I explained the whole thing. At the end  they went crazy  clapping. I was clapping. They were clapping. Finally  I said   Why am I clapping   And one of them said   Because we were listening.  Think of it.       people  busy people  involved in all sorts of different things  listening  understanding and being moved by a piece by Chopin. Now  that is something. Am I sure that every single person followed that  understood it  was moved by it  Of course  I can't be sure. But I'll tell you what happened to me in Ireland during the Troubles     years ago  and I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids on conflict resolution. And I did this with them    a risky thing to do  because they were street kids. And one of them came to me the next morning and he said   You know  I've never listened to classical music in my life  but when you played that shopping piece ...  He said   My brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for him. But last night  when you played that piece  he was the one I was thinking about. And I felt the tears streaming down my face. And it felt really good to cry for my brother.  So I made up my mind at that moment that classical music is for everybody. Everybody. Now  how would you walk    my profession  the music profession doesn't see it that way. They say three percent of the population likes classical music. If only we could move it to four percent  our problems would be over. How would you walk  How would you talk  How would you be  If you thought   Three percent of the population likes classical music  if only we could move it to four percent.  How would you walk or talk  How would you be  If you thought   Everybody loves classical music    they just haven't found out about it yet.  See  these are totally different worlds. Now  I had an amazing experience. I was    years old  I'd been conducting for    years  and I suddenly had a realization. The conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound. My picture appears on the front of the CD    But the conductor doesn't make a sound. He depends  for his power  on his ability to make other people powerful. And that changed everything for me. It was totally life changing. People in my orchestra said   Ben  what happened   That's what happened. I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people. And of course  I wanted to know whether I was doing that. How do you find out  You look at their eyes. If their eyes are shining  you know you're doing it. You could light up a village with this guy's eyes. Right. So if the eyes are shining  you know you're doing it. If the eyes are not shining  you get to ask a question. And this is the question  who am I being that my players' eyes are not shining  We can do that with our children  too. Who am I being  that my children's eyes are not shining  That's a totally different world. Now  we're all about to end this magical  on the mountain week  we're going back into the world. And I say  it's appropriate for us to ask the question  who are we being as we go back out into the world  And you know  I have a definition of success. For me  it's very simple. It's not about wealth and fame and power. It's about how many shining eyes I have around me. So now  I have one last thought  which is that it really makes a difference what we say    the words that come out of our mouth. I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz  one of the rare survivors. She went to Auschwitz when she was    years old. And ... And her brother was eight  and the parents were lost. And she told me this  she said   We were in the train going to Auschwitz  and I looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing. I said  'Why are you so stupid  can't you keep your things together for goodness' sake '  The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother. Unfortunately  it was the last thing she ever said to him  because she never saw him again. He did not survive. And so when she came out of Auschwitz  she made a vow. She told me this. She said   I walked out of Auschwitz into life and I made a vow. And the vow was   I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say.  Now  can we do that  No. And we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong. But it is a possibility to live into. Thank you. Shining eyes. Shining eyes. Thank you  thank you. Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country    I applied for university at a time when I was convinced I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor. And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky. My family was wealthy  and my father believed in one thing  and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted. And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris. And he was a clever man. He sort of said   Well  that's OK  but you've done very well in your math SATs.  In fact  I'd got an    . And he thought I did very well    and I did  too    in the arts  this was my passion. And he said  If you go to MIT   to which I had been given early admission   I will pay for every year you're at MIT  in graduate or undergraduate    as much as you want    I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris.  And I thought that was the best deal in town  so I accepted it immediately. And I decided that if I was good in art  and I was good in mathematics  I'd study architecture  which was the blending of the two. I went and told my headmaster that  at prep school. And I said to him what I was doing  that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together. He said to me something that just went completely over my head. He said   You know  I like grey suits  and I like pin striped suits  but I don't like grey pin striped suits.  And I thought   What a turkey this guy is   and I went off to MIT. I studied architecture  then did a second degree in architecture  and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture. That really  the mixing of art and science was computers  and that that really was the place to bring both  and enjoyed a career doing that. And probably  if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale  I'd put     percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative. And after doing this for a long time  and the Media Lab passing the baton on  I thought   Well  maybe it's time for me to do a project. Something that would be important  but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had.  And in the case of the Media Lab  knowing a lot of people  knowing people who were either executives or wealthy  and also not having  in my own case  a career to worry about anymore. My career  I mean  I'd done my career. Didn't have to worry about earning money. Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me. And I said   Boy  let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features   and thought that if we could address education  by leveraging the children  and bringing to the world the access of the computers  that that was really the thing we should do. Never shown this picture before  and probably going to be sued for it. It's taken at three o'clock in the morning  without the permission of the company. It's about two weeks old. There they are  folks. If you look at the picture  you'll see they're stacked up. Those are conveyor belts that go around. This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by  but then you'll see the ones up above. What happens is  they burn into flash memory the software  and then test them for a few hours. But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line  because it's constant. So they go around in this loop  which is why you see them up there. So this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back. This picture was taken in       just before the IBM PC was even announced. Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself. But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here. And when people tell me   Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids   I say to myself   What planet do you come from   Okay  there's not a person in this room    I don't care how techie you are    there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it. OK  We all need help  even those of us who are very seasoned. This picture of Seymour       years ago. Seymour made a very simple observation in       and then basically presented it in         April    to be precise    called  Teaching Children Thinking.  What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently  and when they debug the programs  they come the closest to learning about learning. That was very important  and in some sense  we've lost that. Kids don't program enough and boy  if there's anything I hope this brings back  it's programming to kids. It's really important. Using applications is OK  but programming is absolutely fundamental. This is being launched with three languages in it  Squeak  Logo  and a third  that I've never even seen before. The point being  this is going to be very  very intensive on the programming side. This photograph is very important because it's much later. This is in the early     s. My son  Dimitri    who's here  many of you know Dimitri    went to Cambodia  set up this school that we had built  just as the school connected it to the Internet. And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this  plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child. This is the same village in Cambodia  just a couple of months ago. These kids are real pros. There were just       machines out there being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental. Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit  but they were all wrong. And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold. There are many reasons  but the two that merit the little bit of time is  one  the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear. I can see any head of state  any executive I want  at any time  because I'm not selling laptops. OK  I have no shareholders. Whether we sell  it doesn't make any difference whatsoever. The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive    you can get the best people in the world. If you look at our professional services  including search firms  including communications  including legal services  including banking  they're all pro bono. And it's not to save money. We've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people. You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission  and they're the best people. We couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary  and we had a queue of people. It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan was very important  and the U.N. allowed us to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing before I met Yves Behar. And while this machine in some sense is silly  in retrospect  it actually served a very important purpose. That pencil yellow crank was remembered by everybody. Everybody remembered the pencil yellow crank. It's different. It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike. Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank    it really is stupid to have it on board  by the way. In spite of what some people in the press don't get it  didn't understand it  we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do    having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want. You want a separate thing  like the AC adaptor. I didn't bring one with me  but they really work much better off board. And then  I could tell you lots about the laptop  but I decided on just four things. Just keep in mind    because there are other people  including Bill Gates  who said   Gee  you've got a real computer.  That computer is unlike anything you've had  and does things    there are four of them    that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power  and I hope that's picked up more by the industry. That the reason that you want to be below two watts is that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body. Dual mode display    that sunlight display's fantastic. We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight  and the more sunlight the better. And that was really critical. The mesh network  it'll become commonplace. And of course   rugged  goes without saying. And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school. And by the way  when I graduated from MIT  I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.  Laughter  So  I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons. The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product. Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design  cheap labor  cheap components  and making a cheap laptop. And  in English  the word  cheap  has a double meaning  which is really appropriate  because it's cheap  in the pejorative sense  as well as inexpensive. But if you take a different approach  and you think of very large scale integration  very advanced materials  very advanced manufacturing    so you're pouring chemicals in one end  iPods are spewing out the other    and really cool design  that's what we wanted to do. And I can race through these and save a lot of time because Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes. These are his slides  and so I don't have to talk about them. But it was really  to us  very important as a strategy. It wasn't just to kind of make it cute  because somebody    you know  good design is very important. Yves showed one of the power generating devices. The mesh network  the reason I    and I won't go into it in great detail    but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world  they're connected. There's not just laptops. And so  we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators. It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other. If you're in a desert  they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart. If you're in the jungle  it's about     meters. So if a kid bicycles home  or walks a few miles  they're going to be off the grid  so to speak. They're not going to be near another laptop  so you have to nail these onto a tree  and sort of  get it. You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network. And that's very important  the user interface. We are launching with    keyboards. English is by far the minority. Latin is relatively rare  too. You just look at some of the languages. I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before. Is there anybody in the room  one person  unless you work with OLPC  is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that's on the screen  There's only one hand    so you get it. Yes  you're right. He's right. It's Amharic  it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia  there's never been a keyboard. There is no keyboard standard because there's no market. And this is the big difference. Again  when you're a nonprofit  you look at children as a mission  not as a market. So we went to Ethiopia  and we helped them make a keyboard. And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard. So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out. And we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning    it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning  it's not what we're doing now    is to go to six countries. Big countries  one of them is not so big  but it's rich. Here's the six. We went to the six  and in each case the head of state said he would do it  he'd do a million. In the case of Gaddafi  he'd do  .  million  and that they would launch it. We thought  this is exactly the right strategy  get it out  and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries. And so I went to each of those countries at least six times  met with the head of state probably two or three times. In each case  got the ministers  went through a lot of the stuff. This was a period in my life where I was traveling     days per year. Not something you'd envy or want to do. In the case of Libya  it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent. The camel smells were unbelievable. And it was    degrees C. I mean  this was not what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries    I say former  because none of them really came through this summer    there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity  make a press release. So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay  bless their hearts. Small country  not so rich. President said he'd do it  and guess what  He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us  nothing specific about sunlight readable  mesh network  low power  but just a vanilla laptop proposal. And guess what  We won it hands down. When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay  the first          boom  went to OLPC. The next day    the next day  not even    hours had passed    in Peru  the president of Peru said   We'll do    .  And boom  a little domino effect. The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it. The president of Ethiopia said he would do it. And boom  boom  boom. The president of Mongolia. And so what happens is  these things start to happen with these countries    still not enough. Add up all those countries  it didn't quite get to thing  so we said   Let's start a program in the United States.  So  end of August  early September  we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle  end    just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place. We thought that was a good time to announce it. Launched it on the    of November. We said it would be just for a short period until the   . We've extended it until the   . And the  Give One  Get One  program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested. The first day it was just wild. And then we said   Well  let's get people to give many. Not just one  and get one  but maybe give      give      .  And that's where you come in. And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and buy     dollars worth of laptops. Okay  Do it  but that's not going to help. Okay  If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for     dollars  whatever it is      people in the room doing it    yeah  great. I want you do something else. And it's not to go out and buy     or        though  I invite you to do that  and        would be even better. Tell people about it  It's got to become viral  OK  Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists. Get your friends to give one  get one. And if each one of you sends it to     or     people  that would be fantastic. I won't dwell on the pricing at all. Just to say that when you do the  Give One  Get One   a lot of press is a bit about   They didn't make it  it's     dollars  it's not    .  It will be     in two years. It will go below    . We've pledged not to add features  but to bring that price down. But it was the countries that wanted it to go up  and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do    I've just said it. Don't just give one  get one. I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even    hours old  or maybe it's    hours. The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship  and I'm talking now about              at a time went out this week. They went to Uruguay  Peru  Mexico. And it's been slow coming  and we're only making about       a week  but we hope  we hope  sometime in next year  maybe by the middle of the year  to hit a million a month. Now put that number  and a million isn't so much. It's not a big number. We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year. But a million a month in laptop land is a big number. And the world production today  everybody combined  making laptops  is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year  we're going to make    percent of the world production. And if we do that  there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there. And we hope if you have EG two years from now  or whenever you have it again  I won't have bad breath  and I will be invited back  and will have  hopefully by then  maybe     million out there to children. Thank you. Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier. So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity  it was incredible. And I want to tell you that story. I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics. It's a competition we're holding  the second X PRIZE  for the first team to sequence     human genomes in    days. We have something called the Genome            individuals we're sequencing as part of that. Craig Venter chairs that event. And I met Professor Hawking  and he said his dream was to travel into space. And I said   I can't take you there  but I can take you into weightlessness into zero g. And he said  on the spot   Absolutely  yes.  Well  the only way to experience zero g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight  weightless flight. You take an airplane  you fly over the top  you're weightless for    seconds. Come back down  you weigh twice as much. You do it again and again. You can get eight     minutes of weightlessness    how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long. We set out to do this. It took us    years to become operational. And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking. We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say  you're crazy  don't do that  you're going kill the guy. And he wanted to go. We worked hard to get all the permissions. And six months later  we sat down at Kennedy Space Center. We had a press conference  we announced our intent to do one zero g parabola  give him    seconds of zero g. And if it went really well  we might do three parabolas. Well  we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this. And what he said  for me  was very moving. He said   Life on Earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ... I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space. I therefore want to encourage public interest in space.  We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center  up inside the NASA vehicle  into the back of the zero g airplane. We had about    people who made donations    we raised          in donations for children's charities    who flew with us. A few TEDsters here. We set up a whole ER. We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane. We were monitoring his PO  of his blood  his heart rate  his blood pressure. We had everything all set in case of an emergency  God knows  you don't want to hurt this world renowned expert. We took off from the shuttle landing facility  where the shuttle takes off and lands. And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero g. Once he was there   we  let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like. And after that first parabola  you know  the doc said everything is great. He was smiling  and we said go. So we did a second parabola. And a third. We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did. And we did a fourth  and a fifth and a sixth. And a seventh and an eighth. And this man does not look like a    year old wheelchair bound man. He was so happy. We are living on a precious jewel  and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet. Please join us in this epic adventure. Thank you so much.
