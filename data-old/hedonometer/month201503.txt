As a software developer and technologist  I've worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years. Civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good  using technology to solve humanitarian problems. This is in      in Uganda  working on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones for expressing dissent. That same technology was deployed later in North Africa for similar purposes to help activists stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control. But over the years  as I have thought about these technologies and the things that I work on  a question kind of nags in the back of my mind  which is  what if we're wrong about the virtues of technology  and if it sometimes actively hurts the communities that we're intending to help  The tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions that if we build great things  it will positively affect everyone. Eventually  these innovations will get out and find everyone. But that's not always the case. I like to call this blind championing of technology  trickle down techonomics   to borrow a phrase.  Laughter  We tend to think that if we design things for the select few  eventually those technologies will reach everyone  and that's not always the case. Technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital. They tend to consolidate in the hands of the few  and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many. And so most of you aren't tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends  so I wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable. In the world of wearables and smartphones and apps  there's a big movement to track people's personal health with applications that track the number of calories that you burn or whether you're sitting too much or walking enough. These technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient  and in turn  these medical facilities are starting to expect these types of efficiencies. As these digital tools find their way into medical rooms  and they become digitally ready  what happens to the digitally invisible  What does the medical experience look like for someone who doesn't have the      phone or watch tracking their every movement  Do they now become a burden on the medical system  Is their experience changed  In the world of finance  Bitcoin and crypto currencies are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world  but the challenge with these technologies is the barrier to entry is incredibly high  right  You need access to the same phones  devices  connectivity  and even where you don't  where you can find a proxy agent  usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate. And so the question that I ask myself is  what happens to the last community using paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency  Another example from my hometown in Philadelphia  I recently went to the public library there  and they are facing an existential crisis. Public funding is dwindling  they have to reduce their footprint to stay open and stay relevant  and so one of the ways they're going about this is digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud. This is great for most kids. Right  You can check out books from home  you can research on the way to school or from school  but these are really two big assumptions  that one  you have access at home  and two  that you have access to a mobile phone  and in Philadelphia  many kids do not. So what does their education experience look like in the wake of a completely cloud based library  what used to be considered such a basic part of education  How do they stay competitive  A final example from across the world in East Africa  there's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights  for a number of reasons. Migrant communities  older generations dying off  and ultimately poor record keeping have led to conflicts over who owns what. And so there was a big movement to put all this information online  to track all the ownership of these plots of land  put them in the cloud  and give them to the communities. But actually  the unintended consequence of this has been that venture capitalists  investors  real estate developers  have swooped in and they've begun buying up these plots of land right out from under these communities  because they have access to the technologies and the connectivity that makes that possible. So that's the common thread that connects these examples  the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make. As engineers  as technologists  we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy. We think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing. This needs to change. We have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build  especially as they increasingly control the world in which we live. In the late '  s  there was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking. I think in       we're long overdue for a similar movement in the area of tech and technology. So  I just encourage you  as you are all thinking about the next big thing  as entrepreneurs  as CEOs  as engineers  as makers  that you think about the unintended consequences of the things that you're building  because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone. Thank you. In the summer of       as a tourist  I visited the rainforests of Borneo for the very first time  and as you might imagine  it was the overwhelming sounds of the forest that struck me the most. There's this constant cacophony of noise. Some things actually do stick out. For example  this here is a big bird  a rhinoceros hornbill. This buzzing is a cicada. This is a family of gibbons. It's actually singing to each other over a great distance. The place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve  which is why you can hear so many of them  but in fact the most important noise that  was coming out of the forest that time was one that I didn't notice  and in fact nobody there had actually noticed it. So  as I said  this was a gibbon reserve. They spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons  but they also have to spend a lot of their time protecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side. And so if we take the sound of the forest and we actually turn down the gibbons  the insects  and the rest  in the background  the entire time  in recordings you heard  was the sound of a chainsaw at great distance. They had three full time guards who were posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging  and one day  we went walking  again as tourists  out into the forest  and within five minutes' walk  we stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down  five minutes' walk  a few hundred meters from the ranger station. They hadn't been able to hear the chainsaws  because as you heard  the forest is very  very loud. It struck me as quite unacceptable that in this modern time  just a few hundred meters away  from a ranger station in a sanctuary  that in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up. It sounds impossible  but in fact  it was quite true. So how do we stop illegal logging  It's really tempting  as an engineer  always to come up with a high tech  super crazy high tech solution  but in fact  you're in the rainforest. It has to be simple  it has to be scalable  and so what we also noticed while were there was that everything we needed was already there. We could build a system that would allow us to stop this using what's already there. Who was there  What was  already in the forest  Well  we had people. We had this group there that was  dedicated  three full time guards  that was dedicated to go and stop it  but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest. The real surprise  this is the big one  was that there was connectivity out in the forest. There was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere. We're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road  there's certainly no electricity  but they had very good cell phone service  these people in the towns were on Facebook all the time  they're surfing the web on their phones  and this sort of got me thinking that in fact it would be possible to use the sounds of the forest  pick up the sounds  of chainsaws programmatically  because people can't hear them  and send an alert. But you have to have a device to go up in the trees. So if we can use some device to listen to the sounds of the forest  connect to the cell phone network that's there  and send an alert to people on the ground  perhaps we could have a solution to this issue for them. But let's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest  because it's something that we've definitely all heard about forever. People in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest since we were kids  and it seems that the message has never changed  We've got to save the rainforest  it's super urgent  this many football fields have been destroyed yesterday. and yet here we are today  about half of the rainforest remains  and we have potentially more urgent  problems like climate change. But in fact  this is the little known fact that I didn't realize at the time  Deforestation accounts  for more greenhouse gas than all of the world's planes  trains  cars  trucks and ships combined. It's the second highest contributor to climate change. Also  according to Interpol  as much as    percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging  like the illegal logging that we saw. So if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there  then in fact we could eat heavily into this    percent and potentially have a major impact in the short term. It might just be the cheapest  fastest way to fight climate change. And so here's the system that we imagine. It looks super high tech. The moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest  the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw  it sends an alert through the standard GSM network that's already there to a ranger in the field who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging. It's no more about going out and finding a tree that's been cut. It's not about seeing  a tree from a satellite in an area that's been clear cut  it's about real time intervention. So I said it was the cheapest and fastest way to do it  but in fact  actually  as you saw  they weren't able to do it  so it may not be so cheap and fast. But if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones  it could be pretty cheap. Cell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year  hundreds of millions in the U.S. alone  not counting the rest of the world  which of course we should do  but in fact  cell phones are great. They're full of sensors. They can listen to the sounds of the forest. We do have to protect them. We have to put them in this box that you see here  and we do have to power them. Powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with  because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy  any sort of solar power under a tree canopy  was an as yet unsolved problem  and that's this unique solar panel design that you see here  which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process. These are strips that are cut down. So this is me putting it all together in my parents' garage  actually. Thanks very much to them for allowing me to do that. As you can see  this is a device up in a tree. What you can see from here  perhaps  is that they are pretty well obscured up in the tree canopy at a distance. That's important  because although they are able to hear chainsaw noises up to a kilometer in the distance  allowing them to cover about three square kilometers  if someone were to take them  it would make the area unprotected. So does it actually work  Well  to test it  we took it back to Indonesia  not the same place  but another place  to another gibbon reserve that was threatened daily by illegal logging. On the very second day  it picked up illegal chainsaw noises. We were able to get a real time alert. I got an email on my phone. Actually  we had just climbed the tree. Everyone had just gotten back down. All these guys are smoking cigarettes  and then I get an email  and they all quiet down  and in fact you can hear the chainsaw really  really faint in the background  but no one had noticed it  until that moment. And so then we took off to actually stop these loggers. I was pretty nervous. This is the moment where we've actually arrived close to where the loggers are. This is the moment where you can see where I'm actually regretting perhaps the entire endeavor. I'm not really sure what's on the other side of this hill. That guy's much braver than I am. But he went  so I had to go  walking up  and in fact  he made it over the hill  and interrupted the loggers in the act. For them  it was such a surprise    they had never  ever been interrupted before    that it was such an impressive event for them  that we've heard from our partners they have not been back since. They were  in fact  great guys. They showed us how the entire operation works  and what they really convinced us on the spot was that if you can show up in real time and stop people  it's enough of a deterrent they won't come back. So    Thank you.  Applause  Word of this spread  possibly because we told a lot of people  and in fact  then some really amazing stuff started to happen. People from around the world started to send us emails  phone calls. What we saw was that people throughout Asia  people throughout Africa  people throughout South America  they told us that they could use it too  and what's most important  what we'd found that we thought might be exceptional  in the forest there was pretty good cell phone service. That was not exceptional  we were told  and that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat. And then something  really amazing happened  which was that people started sending us their own old cell phones. So in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground  people who are already there  who can both improve and use the existing connectivity  and we're using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing  something else in their afterlife  so to speak. And if the rest of the device can be completely recycled  then we believe it's an entirely upcycled device. So again  this didn't come because of any sort of high tech solution. It just came from using what's already there  and I'm thoroughly convinced that if it's not phones  that there's always going to be enough there that you can build similar solutions that can be very effective in new contexts. Thank you very much. My name is Harry Baker. Harry Baker is my name. If your name was Harry Baker  then our names would be the same. It's a short introductory part. Yeah  I'm Harry. I study maths. I write poetry. So I thought I'd start with a love poem about prime numbers. This is called    .  I was going to call it  Prime Time Loving.  That reaction is why I didn't. So     .     wakes up on the wrong  side of the bed. Realizes all his hair is  on one side of his head. Takes just under a minute to work out that it s because of the way that he slept. He finds some clothes and gets dressed. He can t help but look in the mirror and be subtly impressed How he looks rough around the edges and yet casually messed. And as he glances out the window  he sees the sight that he gets blessed with of    from across the street. Now    was beautiful. With perfectly trimmed cuticles  dressed in something suitable. Never rude or crude at all. Unimprovable  right on time as usual  more on cue than a snooker ball but liked to play it super cool.    wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower. He thought of her every second  every minute  every hour. But he knew it wouldn t work  he d never get the girl. Because although she lived  across the street they came from different worlds. While    admired    s perfectly round figure     thought    was odd.  Laughter  One of his favorite films was      Dalmatians.  She preferred the sequel. He romanticized the idea they were star crossed lovers. They could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other. While she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother That separate could not be equal. And though at the time he felt stupid and dumb For trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid mum  He should have been comforted by the simple sum. Take    away from     and you re left with the one. Sure enough after two months of moping around     days later     was who he found  He had lost his keys  and his parents were out. So one day after school  he went into a house As he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door  He wondered why he d never introduced himself before  As she let him in  his jaw  dropped in awe.    was like     but a little bit more.  Laughter  She had prettier eyes  and an approachable smile  And like him  rough around the edges  casual style  And like him  everything was in disorganized piles  And like him  her mum didn t mind if friends stayed a while. Because she was like him   and he liked her. He reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her  And it was different this time. I mean  this girl was wicked  So he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits. She said   I'm   .  He grinned  said   I'm   .  Today I ve had a really nice time  So tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine  She said   Sure.  She loved talking to someone  just as quirky  She agreed to this unofficial first date. In the end he was only ready one minute early  But it didn t matter because she arrived one minute late. And from that moment on there was nonstop chatter  How they loved  X Factor   how they had two factors  How that did not matter  distinctiveness made them better  By the end of the night they knew they were meant together. And one day she was talking about stuck up     She noticed that    looked a bit shifty. He blushed  told her of his crush   The best thing that never happened because it led to us.     was clever  see  not prone to jealousy  She looked him in the eyes and told him quite tenderly   You re     I m     together we combine to become twice what    could ever be.  At this point    had tears in his eyes  Was so glad to have this one of a kind girl in his life. He told her the very definition of being prime Was that with only one and himself could his heart divide  And she was the one he wanted to give his heart to  She said she felt the same and now she knew the films were half true. Because that wasn't real love  that love was just a sample  When it came to real love  they were a prime example. Cheers. That was the first poem that I wrote and it was for a prime number themed  poetry night     Laughter     which turned out to be a prime number themed poetry competition. And I became a prime number themed poetry competition winner  or as I like to call it  a prime minister.  Laughter  And this is how I discovered these things called poetry slams  and if you don't know what  a poetry slam is  it was a format come up with in America    years ago as a way of tricking people into going to poetry events by putting an exciting word like  slam  on the end. And each performer got three minutes to perform and then random audience members would hold up scorecards  and they would end up with a numerical score  and what this meant is  it kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience and encouraged the kind of connection with the listener. And what it also means is you can win. And if you win a poetry slam  you can call yourself a slam champion and pretend you're a wrestler  and if you lose a poetry slam you can say   Oh  what  Poetry's a subjective art form  you can't put numbers on such things.  But I loved it  and I got involved in these slams  and I became the U.K. slam champion and got invited to the Poetry World Cup in Paris  which was unbelievable. It was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five French strangers. And somehow  I won  which was great  and I've been able to travel the world since doing it  but it also means that this next piece is technically the best poem in the world. So... According to five French strangers. So this is  Paper People.  I like people. I'd like some paper people. They d be purple paper people. Maybe pop up purple paper people. Proper pop up purple paper people.  How do you prop up pop up purple paper people   I hear you cry. Well I ... I d probably prop up proper pop up purple paper people with a proper pop up purple people paperclip  but I d pre prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives  a cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the paper slipped. Because I could build a pop up metropolis. but I wouldn t wanna deal with all the paper people politics. paper politicians with their paper thin policies  broken promises without appropriate apologies. There d be a little paper me. And a little paper you. And we could watch paper TV and it would all be pay per view. We d see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package or watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the A . There d be a paper princess Kate but we d all stare at paper Pippa  and then we d all live in fear of killer Jack the Paper Ripper  because the paper propaganda propagates the people's prejudices  papers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists. A little paper me. And a little paper you. And in a pop up population people s problems pop up too. There d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch  and who ignored the people's protests about all the paper cuts  then the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces  by the confetti cannons manned by pre emptive police. And yes there d still be paper money  so there d still be paper greed  and the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need  purchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties  others live in poverty and ain t acknowledged properly. A proper poor economy where so many are proper poor  but while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars. Origami armies unfold plans for paper planes and we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains  but the greater shame is that it always seems to stay the same  what changes is who s in power choosing how to lay the blame  they re naming names  forgetting these are names of people  because in the end it all comes down to people. I like people. 'Cause even when the situation s dire  it is only ever people who are able to inspire  and on paper  it s hard to see how we all cope. But in the bottom of Pandora s box there s still hope  and I still hope 'cause I believe in people. People like my grandparents. Who every single day since I was born  have taken time out of their morning to pray for me. That s      days straight of someone checking I m okay  and that s amazing. People like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners. People who are capable of genuine forgiveness. People like the persecuted Palestinians. People who go out of their way to make your life better  and expect nothing in return. You see  people have potential to be powerful. Just because the people in power tend to pretend to be victims we don t need to succumb to that system. And a paper population is no different. There s a little paper me. And a little paper you. And in a pop up population people's problems pop up too  but even if the whole world fell apart then we d still make it through. Because we re people. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've just got time for one more. For me  poetry has been the ultimate way of ideas without frontiers. When I first started  the people who inspired me were the ones with the amazing stories  and I thought  as an    year old with a happy life  it was too normal  but I could create these worlds where I could talk about my experiences and dreams and beliefs. So it's amazing to be here in front of you today. Thank you for being here. If you weren't here  it would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday. And this is more fun. So this last one is called  The Sunshine Kid.  Thank you very much for listening. Old man sunshine was proud of his sun  And it brightened his day to see his little boy run  Not because of what he d done  nor the problems overcome  But that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one. It hadn t always been like this. There d been times when he d tried to hide his brightness  You see  every star hits periods of hardship  It takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness. If we go back to when he was born in a nebula  We know that he never was thought of as regular  Because he had a flair about him  To say the Midas touch is wrong But all he went near seemed to turn a little bronze  Yes this sun was loved by some more than others  It was a case of Joseph and his dreamcoat and his brothers Because standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons  And jealousy created enemies in those he outshone Such as the Shadow People. Now the Shadow People didn t like the Sunshine Kid  Because he showed up the dark things the Shadow People did  And when he shone he showed the places where the Shadow People hid  So the Shadow People had an evil plan to get rid of him  First up    they made fun of his sunspots  Shooting his dreams from the sky  their words were gunshots  Designed to remind him he wasn t very cool And he didn t fit in with any popular kids at school. They said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to Earth  Essentially he came from nothing and that is what he was worth  He d never get to go to university to learn  Only degrees he d ever show would be the first degree burns From those that came too close  they told him he was too bright  That s why no one ever looked him in the eyes  His judgment became clouded So did the sky  With evaporated tears as the sun started to cry. Because the sunshine kid was bright  with a warm personality  And inside he burned savagely Hurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folk who spoke holes in his soul and left cavities  And as his heart hardened  his spark darkened  Every time they called him names it cooled his flames  He thought they might like him if he kept his light dim But they were busy telling lightning she had terrible aim  He couldn t quite get to grips with what they said  So he let his light be eclipsed by what they said  He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas  And felt like he d been punched in his solar plexus. But that s when Little Miss Sunshine came along Singing her favorite song about how we re made to be strong  And you don t have to be wrong to belong  Just be true to who you are  because we are all stars at heart. Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff  The kind of girl when you looked at her you forgot stuff  But for him  there was no forgetting her  The minute he saw her her image burned in his retina  She was out of this world  and she accepted him  Something about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him  Things weren t as dark as they seemed  and he dared to dream  Shadows were nowhere to be seen  when she was there he beamed  His eyes would light up in ways that can t be faked  When she grinned her rays erased the razor tipped words of hate  They gave each other nicknames  they were  cool star  and  fun sun   And gradually the shadowy damage became undone  She was one in a septillion  and she was brilliant  Could turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion  Loved by billions  from Chileans to Brazilians  And taught the Sunshine Kid the meaning of resilience. She said   All the darkness in the world cannot put out the light from a single candle So how the hell can they handle your light  Only you can choose to dim it  and the sky is the limit  so silence the critics by burning.  And if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtains And let the sun shine through the hurting. In a universe of adversity these stars stuck together  And though days became nights the memories would last forever  Whether the weatherman said it or not  it would be fine  'Cause even behind the clouds the kid could still shine. Yes  the Sunshine Kid was bright  with a warm personality  And inside he burned savagely  Fueled by the fire inspired across galaxies By the girl who showed him belief. Thank you very much. Twenty five years ago  scientists at CERN created the World Wide Web. Since then  the Internet has transformed  the way we communicate  the way we do business  and even the way we live. In many ways  the ideas that gave birth to Google  Facebook  Twitter  and so many others  have now really transformed our lives  and this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society. However  there are also some downsides to this. Today  the average person has an astounding amount of personal information online  and we add to this online information every single time we post on Facebook  each time we search on Google  and each time we send an email. Now  many of us probably think  well  one email  there's nothing in there  right  But if you consider a year's worth of emails  or maybe even a lifetime of email  collectively  this tells a lot. It tells where we have been  who we have met  and in many ways  even what we're thinking about. And the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever  so your data can and will outlive you. What has happened is that we've largely lost control over our data and also our privacy. So this year  as the web turns     it's very important for us to take a moment and think about the implications of this. We have to really think. We've lost privacy  yes  but actually what we've also lost is the idea of privacy itself. If you think about it  most of us here today probably remember  what life was like before the Internet  but today  there's a new generation that is being taught from a very young age to share everything online  and this is a generation that is not  going to remember when data was private. So we keep going down this road     years from now  the word 'privacy' is going to have a completely different meaning from what it means to you and I. So  it's time for us  to take a moment and think  is there anything we can do about this  And I believe there is. Let's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today  email. Before the invention of email  we largely communicated using letters  and the process was quite simple. You would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper  then you would place it into a sealed envelope  and from there  you would go ahead and send it after you put a stamp and address on it. Unfortunately  today  when we actually send an email  we're not sending a letter. What you are sending  in many ways  is actually a postcard  and it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents. So  the solution to this has been known for some time  and there's many attempts to do it. The most basic solution is to use encryption  and the idea is quite simple. First  you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server. Then  you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself. But there's a problem with this  and that is  the email servers also hold the encryption keys  so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it. But not only that  any government could lawfully ask for and get the key to your data  and this is all without you being aware of it. So the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy  in principle  You give everybody their own keys  and then you make sure the server doesn't actually have the keys. This seems like common sense  right  So the question that comes up is  why hasn't this been done yet  Well  if we really think about it  we see that the business model of the Internet today really isn't compatible with privacy. Just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web  and you see that advertising plays a huge role. In fact  this year alone  advertising is     billion dollars  and to optimize the ads that are shown to us  companies have to know everything about us. They need to know where we live  how old we are  what we like  what we don't like  and anything else they can get their hands on. And if you think about it  the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy. So these companies aren't going to give us our privacy. If we want to have privacy online  what we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves. For many years  when it came to email  the only solution was something known as PGP  which was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech savvy. Here's a diagram that basically shows the process for encrypting and decrypting messages. So needless to say  this is not a solution for everybody  and this actually is part of the problem  because if you think about communication  by definition  it involves having someone to communicate with. So while PGP does a great job of what it's designed to do  for the people out there who can't understand how to use it  the option to communicate privately simply does not exist. And this is a problem that we need to solve. So if we want to have privacy online  the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board  and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry. I think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community. What we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible. So last summer  when the Edward Snowden story came out  several colleagues and I decided to see if we could make this happen. At that time  we were working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research at the world's largest particle collider  which collides protons  by the way. We were all scientists  so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our project  ProtonMail.  Laughter  Many startups these days actually begin in people's garages or people's basements. We were a bit different. We started out at the CERN cafeteria  which actually is great  because look  you have all the food and water you could ever want. But even better than this is that every day between    p.m. and   p.m.  free of charge  the CERN cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers  and these guys basically know the answers to everything. So it was in this environment that we began working. What we actually want to do is we want to take your email and turn it into something that looks more like this  but more importantly  we want to do it in a way that you can't even tell that it's happened. So to do this  we actually need a combination of technology and also design. So how do we go about doing something like this  Well  it's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server. So what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer  and we don't generate a single key  but actually a pair of keys  so there's an RSA private key and an RSA public key  and these keys are mathematically connected. So let's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate. So here we have Bob and Alice  who want to communicate privately. So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message. So what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves Bob's computer  and one of the tricks is  we encrypt it using the public key from Alice. Now this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice  and because the message was encrypted using Alice's public key  the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to Alice  and it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key. So we've now accomplished the objective  which is to get the message from Bob to Alice without the server being able to read what's going on. Actually  what I've shown here is a highly simplified picture. The reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this. And that's actually the key design challenge  How do we take all this complexity  all this software  and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it. I think with ProtonMail  we have gotten pretty close to doing this. So let's see how it works in practice. Here  we've got Bob and Alice again  who also want to communicate securely. They simply create accounts on ProtonMail  which is quite simple and takes a few moments  and all the key encryption and generation is happening automatically in the background as Bob is creating his account. Once his account is created  he just clicks  compose   and now he can write his email like he does today. So he fills in his information  and then after that   all he has to do is click  send   and just like that  without understanding cryptography  and without doing anything different from how he writes email today  Bob has just sent an encrypted message. What we have here is really just the first step  but it shows that with improving technology  privacy doesn't have to be difficult  it doesn't have to be disruptive. If we change the goal from maximizing  ad revenue to protecting data  we can actually make it accessible. Now  I know a question on everybody's minds is  okay  protecting privacy  this is a great goal  but can you actually do this without the tons of money that advertisements give you  And I think the answer is actually yes  because today  we've reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is  and when you have that  anything is possible. Earlier this year  ProtonMail actually had so many users  that we ran out of resources  and when this happened  our community of users got together and donated half a million dollars. So this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal. We can also leverage the world. Right now  we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for ProtonMail  and these people come from everywhere  and this really shows that privacy is not just an American or a European issue  it's a global issue that impacts all of us. It's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward. So what do we have to do to solve this problem  Well  first of all  we need to support a different business model for the Internet  one that does not rely entirely on advertisements for revenue and for growth. We actually need to build a new Internet where our privacy and our ability  to control our data is first and foremost. But even more importantly  we have to build an Internet  where privacy is no longer just an option but is also the default. We have done the first step with ProtonMail  but this is really just the first step in a very  very long journey. The good news I can share with you guys today  the exciting news  is that we're not traveling alone. The movement to protect people's privacy and freedom online is really gaining momentum  and today  there are dozens of projects from all around the world who are working together to improve our privacy. These projects protect things from our chat to voice communications  also our file storage  our online search  our online browsing  and many other things. And these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising  but they've found support really from the people  from private individuals like you and I from all over the world. This really matters  because ultimately  privacy depends on each and every one of us  and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros. It's actually a lot more than that. It's our lives  our personal stories  our friends  our families  and in many ways  also our hopes and our aspirations. We need to spend time now to really protect our right to share this only with people that we want to share this with  because without this  we simply can't have a free society. So now's the time for us to collectively stand up and say  yes  we do want to live in a world with online privacy  and yes  we can work together to turn this vision into a reality. Thank you. About    years ago  I gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place. This involved a journey into national and global advocacy and meeting some of the most extraordinary people in the world. In the process  I became a civil society diplomat. Civil society diplomats do three things  They voice the concerns of the people  are not pinned down by national interests  and influence change through citizen networks  not only state ones. And if you want to change the world  we need more of them. But many people still ask   Can civil society really make a big difference  Can citizens influence and shape national and global policy   I never thought I would ask myself these questions  but here I am to share some lessons about two powerful civil society  movements that I've been involved in. They are in issues that I'm passionate about  gun control and drug policy. And these are issues that matter here. Latin America is ground zero for both of them. For example  Brazil    this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal has the world's ugliest record. We are the number one champion in homicidal violence. One in every    people killed around the world is a Brazilian. This translates into over        people dying violently each year. Most of them are young  black boys dying by guns. Brazil is also one of the world's largest consumers of drugs  and the War on Drugs has been especially painful here. Around    percent of the homicides in the streets in Brazil are related to the War on Drugs. The same is true for about    percent of people in jail. And it's not just Brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs. Virtually every country and city across Central and South America is in trouble. Latin America has nine percent of the world's population  but    percent of its global violent deaths. These are not problems we can run away from. I certainly could not. So the first campaign I got involved with started here in      to change Brazil's gun law and to create a program to buy back weapons. In just a few years  we not only changed national legislation that made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun  but we collected and destroyed almost half a million weapons. This was one of the biggest buyback programs in history    but we also suffered some setbacks. We lost a referendum to ban gun sales to civilians in     . The second initiative was also home grown  but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime. I am the executive coordinator of something called the Global Commission on Drug Policy. The commission is a high level group of global leaders brought together to identify more humane and effective approaches to the issue of drugs. Since we started in       the taboo on drugs is broken. Across the Americas  from the US and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay  change is in the air. But rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements  I just want to share with you four key insights. I call them lessons to change the world. There are certainly many more  but these are the ones that stand out to me. So the first lesson is  Change and control the narrative. It may seem obvious  but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative. This is something that veteran politicians understand  but that civil society groups generally do not do very well. In the case of drug policy  our biggest success has been to change the discussion away from prosecuting a War on Drugs to putting people's health and safety first. In a cutting edge report we just launched in New York  we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this      billion market are criminal gangs and cartels. So in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups  we need to change the conversation. We need to make illegal drugs legal. But before I get you too excited  I don't mean drugs should be a free for all. What I'm talking about  and what the Global Commission advocates for is creating a highly regulated market  where different drugs would have different degrees of regulation. As for gun control  we were successful in changing  but not so much in controlling  the narrative. And this brings me to my next lesson  Never underestimate your opponents. If you want to succeed in changing the world  you need to know who you're up against. You need to learn their motivations and points of view. In the case of gun control  we really underestimated our opponents. After a very successful gun collection program  we were elated. We had support from    percent of Brazilians  and thought that this could help us win the referendum to ban gun sales to civilians. But we were dead wrong. During a televised    day public debate  our opponent used our own arguments against us. We ended up losing the popular vote. It was really terrible. The National Rifle Association    yes  the American NRA    came to Brazil. They inundated our campaign with their propaganda  that as you know  links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy. They simply threw everything at us. They used our national flag  our independence anthem. They invoked women's rights and misused images of Mandela  Tiananmen Square  and even Hitler. They won by playing with people's fears. In fact  guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign. Their focus was on individual rights. But I ask you  which right is more important  the right to life or the right to have a gun that takes life away  We thought people would vote in defense of life  but in a country with a recent past of military dictatorship  the anti government message of our opponents resonated  and we were not prepared to respond. Lesson learned. We've been more successful in the case of drug policy. If you asked most people    years ago if an end to the War on Drugs was possible  they would have laughed. After all  there are huge military police prisons and financial establishments benefiting from this war. But today  the international drug control regime is starting to crumble. Governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches. The Global Commission on Drug Policy really knew its opposition  and rather than fighting them  our chair    former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso    reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum  from liberals to conservatives. This high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies. It was this reasoned  informed and strategic discussion that revealed the sad truth about the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs has simply failed across every metric. Drugs are cheaper and more available than ever  and consumption has risen globally. But even worse  it also generated massive negative unintended consequences. It is true that some people have made these arguments before  but we've made a difference by anticipating the arguments of our opponents and by leveraging powerful voices that a few years ago would probably have resisted change. Third lesson  Use data to drive your argument. Guns and drugs are emotive issues  and as we've painfully learned in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil  sometimes it's impossible to cut through the emotions and get to the facts. But this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try. Until quite recently  we simply didn't know how many Brazilians were killed by guns. Amazingly  it was a local soap opera called  Mulheres Apaixonadas     or  Women in Love     that kicked off Brazil's national gun control campaign. In one highly viewed episode  a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet. Brazilian grannies and housewives were outraged  and in a case of art imitating life  this episode also included footage of a real gun control march that we had organized right here  outside in Copacabana Beach. The televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion. Within weeks  our national congress approved the disarmament bill that had been languishing for years. We were then able to mobilize data to show the successful outcomes of the change in the law and gun collection program. Here is what I mean  We could prove that in just one year  we saved more than       lives. And in the case of drugs  in order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue  we managed to gather and present data that shows that today's drug policies cause much more harm than drug use per se  and people are starting to get it. My fourth insight is  Don't be afraid to bring together odd bedfellows. What we've learned in Brazil    and this doesn't only apply to my country    is the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together. If you want to change the world  it helps to have a good cross section of society on your side. In both the case of guns and drugs  we brought together a wonderful mix of people. We mobilized the elite and got huge support from the media. We gathered the victims  human rights champions  cultural icons. We also assembled the professional classes    doctors  lawyers  academia and more. What I've learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change. In the case of drugs  we needed libertarians  anti prohibitionists  legalizers  and liberal politicians. They may not agree on everything  in fact  they disagree on almost everything. But the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view. Over a decade ago  I had a comfortable future working for an investment bank. I was as far removed from the world of civil society diplomacy as you can imagine. But I took a chance. I changed course  and on the way  I helped  to create social movements that I believe have made  some parts of the world safer. Each and every one of us has the power to change the world. No matter what the issue  and no matter how hard the fight  civil society is central to the blueprint for change. Thank you. Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well. After one trillion dollars in African development related aid in the last    years  real per capita income today is lower than it was in the     s. Aid is not doing too well. In response  the Bretton Woods institutions    the IMF and the World Bank    pushed for free trade not aid  yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence that free trade leads to economic growth. The newly prescribed  silver bullet is microcredit. We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea that every poor peasant in Africa is an entrepreneur. Yet my work and travel in    plus countries across Africa have taught me that most people want jobs instead. My solution  Forget micro entrepreneurs. Let's invest in building pan African titans like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim. Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Celtel International in '   and built it into a mobile  cellular provider with    million subscribers across    African countries by     . The Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model  which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge sharing. Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition. Consider these two alternative scenarios. One  You loan     dollars  to each of     banana farmers allowing them to dry  their surplus bananas and fetch    percent more revenue at the local market. Or two  You give         dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields    percent additional income to all     banana farmers and creates    additional jobs. We invested in the second scenario  and backed    year old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi to set up an agro processing factory called Stawi to produce gluten free banana based flour and baby food. Stawi is leveraging economies of scale and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners but its workers  who have an ownership in the business. Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim  which requires skill  financing  local and global partnerships  and extraordinary perseverance. But why pan African  The scramble for Africa during the Berlin Conference of         where  quite frankly  we Africans were not exactly consulted    resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations  Liberia  four million  Cape Verde         . Pan Africa gives you one billion people  granted across    countries with trade barriers and other impediments  but our ancestors traded across the continent before Europeans drew lines around us. The pan African opportunities outweigh the challenges  and that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya to Algeria  Nigeria  Ghana  and anywhere else that will buy our food. We hope to help solve food security  empower farmers  create jobs  develop the local economy  and we hope to become rich in the process. While it's not the sexiest approach  and maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel good as giving a woman     dollars  to buy a goat on kiva.org  perhaps supporting fewer  higher impact entrepreneurs to build massive businesses that scale pan Africa can help change this. The political freedom for which our forebearers fought is meaningless without economic freedom. We hope to aid this fight for economic freedom by building world class businesses  creating indigenous wealth  providing jobs that we so desperately need  and hopefully helping achieve this. Africa shall rise. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So Sangu  of course  this is strong rhetoric. You're making     percent contrast between microcredit and regular investment and growing regular investment. Do you think there is a role for microcredit at all  Sangu Delle  I think there is a role. Microcredit has been a great  innovative way to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid. But for the problems we face in Africa  when we are looking at the Marshall Plan to revitalize war torn Europe  it was not full of donations of sheep. We need more than just microcredit. We need more than just give     dollars. We need to build big businesses  and we need jobs. TR  Very good. Thank you so much. Today I'm going to speak to you about the last    years of architectural history. That's a lot to pack into    minutes. It's a complex topic  so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place  New Jersey. Because    years ago  I'm from Jersey  and I was six  and I lived there in my parents' house in a town called Livingston  and this was my childhood bedroom. Around the corner from my bedroom was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister. And in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcony that overlooked the family room. And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV  so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom  everyone would see me  and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel  everyone would see me. And I looked like this. I was awkward  insecure  and I hated it. I hated that walk  I hated that balcony  I hated that room  and I hated that house. And that's architecture. Done. That feeling  those emotions that I felt  that's the power of architecture  because architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning  it's about those visceral  emotional connections that we feel to the places that we occupy. And it's no surprise that we feel that way  because according to the EPA  Americans spend    percent of their time indoors. That's    percent of our time surrounded by architecture. That's huge. That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize. That makes us a little bit gullible and very  very predictable. It means that when I show you a building like this  I know what you think  You think  power  and  stability  and  democracy.  And I know you think that because it's based on a building that was build       years ago by the Greeks. This is a trick. This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of. It's a predictable emotional connection  and we've been using this trick for a long  long time. We used it       years ago to build banks. We used it in the   th century to build art museums. And in the   th century in America  we used it to build houses. And look at these solid  stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements. This is really  really useful  because building things is terrifying. It's expensive  it takes a long time  and it's very complicated. And the people that build things    developers and governments    they're naturally afraid of innovation  and they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to. That's how we end up with buildings like this. This is a nice building. This is the Livingston Public Library that was completed in      in my hometown  and  you know  it's got a dome and it's got this round thing  and columns  red brick  and you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building  children  property values and history. But it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today. That same year  in       on the other side of the country  another library was completed  and it looks like this. It's in Seattle. This library is about how we consume media in a digital age. It's about a new kind of public amenity for the city  a place to gather and read and share. So how is it possible that in the same year  in the same country  two buildings  both called libraries  look so completely different  And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum. On the one side is innovation  and architects are constantly pushing  pushing for new technologies  new typologies  new solutions for the way that we live today. And we push and we push and we push until we completely alienate all of you. We wear all black  we get very depressed  you think we're adorable  we're dead inside because we've got no choice. We have to go to the other side and reengage those symbols that we know you love. So we do that  and you're happy  we feel like sellouts  so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we've gone for the last     years  and certainly for the last    years. Okay     years ago we were coming out of the '  s. Architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism. It's about concrete. You can guess this. Small windows  dehumanizing scale. This is really tough stuff. So as we get closer to the '  s  we start to reengage those symbols. We push the pendulum back into the other direction. We take these forms that we know you love and we update them. We add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials. And you love it. And we can't give you enough of it. We take Chippendale armoires and we turned those into skyscrapers  and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass. Forms got big  forms got bold and colorful. Dwarves became columns. Swans grew to the size of buildings. It was crazy. But it's the '  s  it's cool. We're all hanging out in malls and we're all moving to the suburbs  and out there  out in the suburbs  we can create our own architectural fantasies. And those fantasies  they can be Mediterranean or French or Italian. Possibly with endless breadsticks. This is the thing about postmodernism. This is the thing about symbols. They're easy  they're cheap  because instead of making places  we're making memories of places. Because I know   and I know all of you know  this isn't Tuscany. This is Ohio. So architects get frustrated  and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction. In the late '  s and early '  s  we start experimenting with something called deconstructivism. We throw out historical symbols  we rely on new  computer aided design techniques  and we come up with new compositions  forms crashing into forms. This is academic and heady stuff  it's super unpopular  we totally alienate you. Ordinarily  the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction. And then  something amazing happened. In       this building opened. This is the Guggenheim Bilbao  by Frank Gehry. And this building fundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture. Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics  academics  and the general public were completely united around a building. The New York Times called this building a miracle. Tourism in Bilbao increased       percent after this building was completed. So all of a sudden  everybody wants one of these buildings  L.A.  Seattle  Chicago  New York  Cleveland  Springfield. Everybody wants one  and Gehry is everywhere. He is our very first starchitect. Now  how is it possible that these forms    they're wild and radical    how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world  And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism. We created an emotional reaction to these forms. So did every mayor in the world. So every mayor knew that if they had these forms  they had culture and tourism. This phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium happened to a few other starchitects. It happened to Zaha and it happened to Libeskind  and what happened to these elite few architects at the turn of the new millennium could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture  as digital media starts to increase the speed with which we consume information. Because think about how you consume architecture. A thousand years ago  you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building. Transportation speeds up  You can take a boat  you can take a plane  you can be a tourist. Technology speeds up  You can see it in a newspaper  on TV  until finally  we are all architectural photographers  and the building has become disembodied from the site. Architecture is everywhere now  and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture. Because architecture actually moves quite quickly. It doesn't take long to think about a building. It takes a long time to build a building  three or four years  and in the interim  an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not. That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture. That's how we end up with buildings like this. Brutalism wasn't a two year movement  it was a    year movement. For    years  we were producing buildings like this because we had no idea how much you hated it. It's never going to happen again  I think  because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete  of steel  or of the elevator  and it's a media revolution. So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum  it starts swinging faster and faster  until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously  and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol  between us  the architects  and you  the public. Now we can make nearly instantaneous  emotionally charged symbols out of something that's brand new. Let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed. We were hired to replace this building  which burned down. This is the center of a town called the Pines in Fire Island in New York State. It's a vacation community. We proposed a building that was audacious  that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to  and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared  so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram  and we let people start to do what they do  share it  comment  like it  hate it. But that meant that two years before the building was complete  it was already a part of the community  so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product  there were no surprises. This building was already a part of this community  and then that first summer  when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media  the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media  because these  these are not just pictures of a building  they're your pictures of a building. And as you use them to tell your story  they become part of your personal narrative  and what you're doing is you're short circuiting all of our collective memory  and you're making these charged symbols for us to understand. That means we don't need the Greeks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture. We can tell each other what we think about architecture  because digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us  it's changed the relationship between us and buildings. Think for a second about those librarians back in Livingston. If that building was going to be built today  the first thing they would do is go online and search  new libraries.  They would be bombarded by examples of experimentation  of innovation  of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be. That's ammunition. That's ammunition that they can take with them to the mayor of Livingston  to the people of Livingston  and say  there's no one answer to what a library is today. Let's be a part of this. This abundance of experimentation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment. Everything is different now. Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings  and you aren't the hapless public  the consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore. Architects can hear you  and you're not intimidated by architecture. That means that that pendulum swinging back and forth from style to style  from movement to movement  is irrelevant. We can actually move forward and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces. This is the end of architectural history  and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today. It means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works. It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn  not some red brick historical pastiche of what we think a stadium ought to be. It means that robots are going to build our buildings  because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce. And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around. It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach  Florida  can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night. It means that three architects can dream about swimming in the East River of New York  and then raise nearly half a million dollars from a community that gathered around their cause  no one client anymore. It means that no building is too small for innovation  like this little reindeer pavilion that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe. And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful to be lovable  like this ugly little building in Spain  where the architects dug a hole  packed it with hay  and then poured concrete around it  and when the concrete dried  they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that's left when it's done is this hideous little room that's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made  and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset. Because it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings. It doesn't matter how we build  it matters what we build. Architects already know how to make buildings that are greener and smarter and friendlier. We've just been waiting for all of you to want them. And finally  we're not on opposite sides anymore. Find an architect  hire an architect  work with us to design better buildings  better cities  and a better world  because the stakes are high. Buildings don't just reflect our society  they shape our society down to the smallest spaces  the local libraries  the homes where we raise our children  and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom. Thank you. We need to change the culture in our jails and prisons  especially for young inmates. New York state is one of only two in the U.S. that automatically arrests and tries     to    year olds as adults. This culture of violence takes these young people and puts them in a hostile environment  and the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on. There's not really much for these young people to do to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them. Until we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to     we need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people. I know firsthand. Before I ever turned     I spent approximately     days on Rikers Island  and to add to that I spent almost     days in solitary confinement  and let me tell you this  Screaming at the top of your lungs all day on your cell door or screaming at the top of your lungs out the window  it gets tiring. Since there's not much for you to do while you're in there  you start pacing back and forth in your cell  you start talking to yourself  your thoughts start running wild  and then your thoughts become your own worst enemy. Jails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person  not cause him or her to become more angry  frustrated  and feel more hopeless. Since there's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people  they pretty much  reenter society with nothing. And there's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating. But it all starts with the C.O.s. It's very easy for some people to look at these correctional officers as the good guys and the inmates as the bad guys  or vice versa for some  but it's a little more than that. See  these C.O.s are normal  everyday people. They come from the same neighborhoods as the population they  serve.  They're just normal people. They're not robots  and there's  nothing special about them. They do pretty much everything anybody else in society does. The male C.O.s want to talk and flirt with the female C.O.s. They play the little high school kid games with each other. They politic with one another. And the female C.O.s gossip to each other. So I spent numerous amounts of time with numerous amounts of C.O.s  and let me tell you about this one in particular named Monroe. One day he pulled me in between the A and B doors which separate the north and south sides of our housing unit. He pulled me there because I had a physical altercation with another young man in my housing unit  and he felt  since there was a female officer working on the floor  that I violated his shift. So he punched me in my chest. He kind of knocked the wind out of me. I wasn't impulsive  I didn't react right away  because I know this is their house. I have no wins. All he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately. So I just gave him a look in his eyes and I guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning  and he said to me   Your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble  because you're looking like you want to fight.  So he commenced to taking off his utility belt  he took off his shirt and his badge  and he said   We could fight.  So I asked him   You gonna hold it down   Now  that's a term that's commonly used on Rikers Island meaning that you're not going to say anything to anybody  and you're not going to report it. He said   Yeah  I'm gonna hold it down. You gonna hold it down   I didn't even respond. I just punched him right in his face  and we began fighting right then and there. Towards the end of the fight  he slammed me up against the wall  so while we were tussled up  he said to me   You good   as if he got the best of me  but in my mind  I know I got the best of him  so I replied very cocky   Oh  I'm good  you good   He said   Yeah  I'm good   I'm good.  We let go  he shook my hand  said he gave me my respect  gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way. Believe it or not  you come across some C.O.s on Rikers Island that'll fight you one on one. They feel that they understand how it is  and they feel that I'm going to meet you where you're at. Since this is how you commonly handle your disputes  we can handle it in that manner. I walk away from it like a man  you walk away from it like a man  and that's it. Some C.O.s feel that they're jailing with you. This is why they have that mentality and that attitude and they go by that concept. In some instances  we're in it together with the C.O.s. However  institutions need to give these correctional officers proper trainings on how to properly deal with the adolescent population  and they also need to give them proper trainings on how to deal with  the mental health population as well. These C.O.s play a big factor in these young people's lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case. So why not try to mentor these young people while they're there  Why not try to give them some type of insight to make a change  so once they reenter back into society  they're doing something positive  A second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming. When I was on Rikers Island  the huge thing was solitary confinement. Solitary confinement was originally designed to break a person mentally  physically and emotionally. That's what it was designed for. The U.S. Attorney General recently released a report stating that they're going to ban solitary confinement in New York state for teens. One thing that kept me sane while I was in solitary confinement was reading. I tried to educate myself as much as possible. I read any and everything I could get my hands on. And aside from that  I wrote music and short stories. Some programs that I feel would benefit our young people are art therapy programs for the kids that like to draw and have that talent  and what about the young individuals that are musically inclined  How about a music program for them that actually teaches them how to write and make music  Just a thought. When adolescents come to Rikers Island  C    RNDC is the building that they're housed in. That's nicknamed  gladiator school   because you have a young individual coming in from the street thinking that they're tough  being surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals from all of the five boroughs  and everybody feels that they're tough. So now you have a bunch of young gentlemen poking their chests out feeling that I have to prove I'm equally as tough as you or I'm tougher than you  you and you. But let's be honest  That culture is very dangerous and damaging to our young people. We need to help institutions and these teens realize that they don't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led when they were on the street  that they can actually make a change. It's sad to report that while I was in prison  I used to hear dudes talking about when they get released from prison  what type of crimes they're going to commit when they get back in the street. The conversations used to sound something like this   Oh  when I hit the street  my brother got this connection for this  that and the third   or   My man over here got this connection for the low price. Let's exchange information   and   When we hit the town  we're going to do it real big.  I used to hear these conversations and think to myself   Wow  these dudes are really talking about going back in the street and committing future crimes.  So I came up with a name for that  I called it a go back to jail quick scheme because really  how long is that going to last  You get a retirement plan with that  Nice little pension      k       b   You get health insurance  Dental  But I will tell you this  Being in jail and being in prison  I came across some of the most intelligent  brilliant  and talented people that I would ever meet. I've seen individuals take a potato chip bag and turn it into the most beautiful picture frame. I've seen individuals take the state soap that's provided for free and turn them into the most beautiful sculptures that would make Michelangelo look like a kindergartner made it. At the age of     I was in a maximum security prison called Elmira Correctional Facility. I just came out of the weight shack from working out  and I saw an older gentleman that I knew standing in the middle of the yard just looking up at the sky. Mind you  this older gentlemen was serving a    and a third to life sentence in which he already had served    years of that sentence. So I walk up to him and I said   O.G.  what's going on  man  you good   He looked at me  and he said   Yeah  I'm good  young blood.  I'm like   So what are you looking up at the sky for  man  What's so fascinating up there   He said   You look up and you tell me what you see.   Clouds.   Laughter  He said   All right. What else do you see   At that time  it was a plane passing by. I said   All right  I see an airplane.  He said   Exactly  and what's  on that airplane    People.   Exactly. Now where's that plane and those people going    I don't know. You know  Please let me know if you do. Then let me get some lottery numbers.  He said   You're missing the big picture  young blood. That plane with those people is going somewhere  while we're here stuck. The big picture is this  That plane with those people going somewhere  that's life passing us by while we behind these walls  stuck.  Ever since that day  that sparked something in my mind and made me know I had to make a change. Growing up  I was always a good  smart kid. Some people would say I was a little too smart for my own good. I had dreams of becoming an architect or an archaeologist. Currently  I'm working at the Fortune Society  which is a reentry program  and I work with people as a case manager that are at high risk for recidivism. So I connect them with the services that they need once they're released from jail and prison so they can make a positive transition back into society. If I was to see my    year old self today  I would sit down and talk to him and try to educate him and I would let him know   Listen  this is me. I'm you. This is us. We are one. Everything that you're about to do  I know what you're gonna do before you do it because I already did it  and I would encourage him not to hang out with x  y and z people. I would tell him not to be in such and such place. I would tell him  keep your behind in school  man  because that's where you need to be  because that's what's going to get you somewhere in life. This is the message that we should be sharing with our young men and young women. We shouldn't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence that are nearly impossible for them to escape. Thank you. Hello. I'm a toy developer. With a dream of creating new toys that have never been seen before  I began working at a toy company nine years ago. When I first started working there  I proposed many new ideas to my boss every day. However  my boss always asked if I had the data to prove it would sell  and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data. Data  data  data. So I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product. However  I was unable to think of anything new at that moment. My ideas were unoriginal. I wasn't getting any new ideas and I grew tired of thinking. It was so hard that I became this skinny. It's true.  Applause  You've all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too. Your boss was being difficult. The data was difficult. You become sick of thinking. Now  I throw out the data. It's my dream to create new toys. And now  instead of data  I'm using a game called Shiritori to come up with new ideas. I would like to introduce this method today. What is Shiritori  Take apple  elephant  and trumpet  for example. It's a game where  you take turns saying words that start with the last letter of the previous word. It's the same in Japanese and English. You can play Shiritori as you like   neko  kora  raibu  burashi   etc  etc.  Cat  cola  concert  brush  Many random words will come out. You force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas. In my case  for example  since I want to think of toys  what could a toy cat be  A cat that lands after doing a somersault from a high place  How about a toy with cola  A toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet  Ridiculous ideas are okay. The key is to keep them flowing. The more ideas you produce  you're sure to come up with some good ones  too. A brush  for example. Can we make a toothbrush into a toy  We could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and    you've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth. Kids who don't like to brush their teeth might begin to like it. Can we make a hat into a toy  How about something like a roulette game  where you try the hat on one by one  and then  when someone puts it on  a scary alien breaks through the top screaming   Ahh   I wonder if there would be a demand for this at parties  Ideas that didn't come out while you stare at the data will start to come out. Actually  this bubble wrap  which is used to pack fragile objects  combined with a toy  made Mugen Pop Pop  a toy where you can pop the bubbles as much as you like. It was a big hit when it reached stores. Data had nothing to do with its success. Although it's only popping bubbles  it's a great way to kill time  so please pass this around amongst yourselves today and play with it. Anyway  you continue to come up with useless ideas. Think up many trivial ideas  everyone. If you base your ideas on data analysis and know what you're aiming for  you'll end up trying too hard  and you can't produce new ideas. Even if you know what your aim is  think of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed. If you do this  you surely will hit somewhere near the center. At least one will. That's the one you should choose. If you do so  that idea will be in demand and  moreover  it will be brand new. That is how I think of new ideas. It doesn't have to be Shiritori  there are many different methods. You just have to choose words at random. You can flip through a dictionary and choose words at random. For example  you could look up two random letters and gather the results or go to the store and connect product names with what you want to think of. The point is to gather random words  not information from the category you're thinking for. If you do this  the ingredients for the association of ideas are collected and form connections that will produce many ideas. The greatest advantage to this method is the continuous flow of images. Because you're thinking of one word after another  the image of the previous word is still with you. That image will automatically be related with future words. Unconsciously  a concert will be connected to a brush and a roulette game will be connected to a hat. You wouldn't even realize it. You can come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. This method is  of course  not just for toys. You can collect ideas for books  apps  events  and many other projects. I hope you all try this method. There are futures that are born from data. However  using this silly game called Shiritori  I look forward to the exciting future you will create  a future you couldn't even imagine. Thank you very much. I have a confession to make. I'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead. But recently  I've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation. I'm an ethnographer. I use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which I'm interested. So along with three co conspirators  I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation. We studied    men and women  located in seven countries across the globe  working in    different industries. In total  we spent hundreds of hours on the ground  on site  watching these leaders in action. We ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did. The bottom line  If we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again  we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership. Leading innovation is not about creating a vision  and inspiring others to execute it. But what do we mean by innovation  An innovation is anything that is both new and useful. It can be a product or service. It can be a process or a way of organizing. It can be incremental  or it can be breakthrough. We have a pretty inclusive definition. How many of you recognize this man  Put your hands up. Keep your hands up  if you know who this is. How about these familiar faces  From your show of hands  it looks like many of you have seen a Pixar movie  but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull  the founder and CEO of Pixar    one of the companies I had the privilege of studying. My first visit to Pixar was in       when they were working on  Ratatouille   that provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef. Computer generated movies are really mainstream today  but it took Ed and his colleagues nearly    years to create the first full length C.G. movie. In the    years hence  they've produced    movies. I was recently at Pixar  and I'm here to tell you that number    is sure to be a winner. When many of us think about innovation  though  we think about an Einstein having an 'Aha ' moment. But we all know that's a myth. Innovation is not about solo genius  it's about collective genius. Let's think for a minute about what it takes to make a Pixar movie  No solo genius  no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies. On the contrary  it takes about     people four to five years  to make one of those movies. To help us understand the process  an individual in the studio drew a version of this picture. He did so reluctantly  because it suggested that the process  was a neat series of steps done by discrete groups. Even with all those arrows  he thought it failed to really tell you just how iterative  interrelated and  frankly  messy their process was. Throughout the making of a movie at Pixar  the story evolves. So think about it. Some shots go through quickly. They don't all go through in order. It depends on how vexing the challenges are that they come up with when they are working on a particular scene. So if you think about that scene in  Up  where the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird  that    seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect. The other thing about a Pixar movie is that no part of the movie is considered finished until the entire movie wraps. Partway through one production  an animator drew a character with an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side. When the director saw that drawing  he thought it was great. It was beautiful  but he said   You've got to lose it  it doesn't fit the character.  Two weeks later  the director came back and said   Let's put in those few seconds of film.  Because that animator was allowed to share what we referred to as his slice of genius  he was able to help that director reconceive the character in a subtle but important way that really improved the story. What we know is  at the heart of innovation is a paradox. You have to unleash the talents and passions of many people and you have to harness them into a work that is actually useful. Innovation is a journey. It's a type of collaborative problem solving  usually among people who have different expertise and different points of view. Innovations rarely get created full blown. As many of you know  they're the result  usually  of trial and error. Lots of false starts  missteps and mistakes. Innovative work can be very exhilarating  but it also can be really downright scary. So when we look at why it is that Pixar is able to do what it does  we have to ask ourselves  what's going on here  For sure  history and certainly Hollywood  is full of star studded teams that have failed. Most of those failures are attributed to too many stars or too many cooks  if you will  in the kitchen. So why is it that Pixar  with all of its cooks  is able to be so successful time and time again  When we studied an Islamic Bank in Dubai  or a luxury brand in Korea  or a social enterprise in Africa  we found that innovative organizations are communities that have three capabilities  creative abrasion  creative agility and creative resolution. Creative abrasion is about being able to create a marketplace of ideas through debate and discourse. In innovative organizations  they amplify differences  they don't minimize them. Creative abrasion is not about brainstorming  where people suspend their judgment. No  they know how to have very heated but constructive arguments to create a portfolio of alternatives. Individuals in innovative organizations learn how to inquire  they learn how to actively listen  but guess what  They also learn how to advocate for their point of view. They understand that innovation rarely happens unless you have both diversity and conflict. Creative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas through quick pursuit  reflection and adjustment. It's about discovery driven learning where you act  as opposed to plan  your way to the future. It's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method and the artistic process. It's about running a series of experiments  and not a series of pilots. Experiments are usually about learning. When you get a negative outcome  you're still really learning something that you need to know. Pilots are often about being right. When they don't work  someone or something is to blame. The final capability is creative resolution. This is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to reconfigure them in new combinations to produce a solution that is new and useful. When you look at innovative organizations  they never go along to get along. They don't compromise. They don't let one group or one individual dominate  even if it's the boss  even if it's the expert. Instead  they have developed a rather patient and more inclusive decision making process that allows for both and solutions to arise and not simply either or solutions. These three capabilities are why we see that Pixar is able to do what it does. Let me give you another example  and that example is the infrastructure group of Google. The infrastructure group of Google is the group that has to keep the website up and running     . So when Google was about to introduce Gmail and YouTube  they knew that their data storage system wasn't adequate. The head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time was a man named Bill Coughran. Bill and his leadership team  who he referred to as his brain trust  had to figure out what to do about this situation. They thought about it for a while. Instead of creating a group to tackle this task  they decided to allow groups to emerge spontaneously around different alternatives. Two groups coalesced. One became known as Big Table  the other became known as Build It From Scratch. Big Table proposed that they build on the current system. Build It From Scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system. Separately  these two teams were allowed to work full time on their particular approach. In engineering reviews  Bill described his role as   Injecting honesty into the process by driving debate.  Early on  the teams were encouraged to build prototypes so that they could  bump them up against reality and discover for themselves the strengths and weaknesses of their particular approach.  When Build It From Scratch shared their prototype with the group whose beepers would have to go off in the middle of the night if something went wrong with the website  they heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design. As the need for a solution became more urgent and as the data  or the evidence  began to come in  it became pretty clear that the Big Table solution was the right one for the moment. So they selected that one. But to make sure that they did not lose the learning of the Build it From Scratch team  Bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next generation system. This whole process took nearly two years  but I was told that they were all working at breakneck speed. Early in that process  one of the engineers had gone to Bill and said   We're all too busy for this inefficient system of running parallel experiments.  But as the process unfolded  he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions. He admitted   If you had forced us to all be on one team  we might have focused on proving who was right  and winning  and not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for Google.  Why is it that Pixar and Google are able to innovate time and again  It's because they've mastered the capabilities required for that. They know how to do collaborative problem solving  they know how to do discovery driven learning and they know how to do integrated decision making. Some of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now   We don't know how to do those things in my organization. So why do they know how to do those things at Pixar  and why do they know how to do those things at Google   When many of the people that worked for Bill told us  in their opinion  that Bill was one of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley  we completely agreed  the man is a genius. Leadership is the secret sauce. But it's a different kind of leadership  not the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership. One of the leaders I met with early on said to me   Linda  I don't read books on leadership. All they do is make me feel bad.   Laughter   In the first chapter they say I'm supposed to create a vision. But if I'm trying to do something that's truly new  I have no answers. I don't know what direction we're going in and I'm not even sure I know how to figure out how to get there.  For sure  there are times when visionary leadership is exactly what is needed. But if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again  we must recast our understanding of what leadership is about. Leading innovation is about creating the space where people are willing and able to do the hard work of innovative problem solving. At this point  some of you may be wondering   What does that leadership really look like   At Pixar  they understand that innovation takes a village. The leaders focus on building a sense of community and building those three capabilities. How do they define leadership  They say leadership is about creating a world to which people want to belong. What kind of world do people want to belong in at Pixar  A world where you're living at the frontier. What do they focus their time on  Not on creating a vision. Instead they spend their time thinking about   How do we design a studio that has the sensibility of a public square so that people will interact  Let's put in a policy that anyone  no matter what their level or role  is allowed to give notes to the director about how they feel about a particular film. What can we do to make sure that all the disruptors  all the minority voices in this organization  speak up and are heard  And  finally  let's bestow credit in a very generous way.  I don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a Pixar movie  but the babies born during a production are listed there. How did Bill think about what his role was  Bill said   I lead a volunteer organization. Talented people don't want to follow me anywhere. They want to cocreate with me the future. My job is to nurture the bottom up and not let it degenerate into chaos.  How did he see his role   I'm a role model  I'm a human glue  I'm a connector  I'm an aggregator of viewpoints. I'm never a dictator of viewpoints.  Advice about how you exercise the role  Hire people who argue with you. And  guess what  Sometimes it's best to be deliberately fuzzy and vague. Some of you may be wondering now  what are these people thinking  They're thinking   I'm not the visionary  I'm the social architect. I'm creating the space where people are willing and able to share and combine their talents and passions.  If some of you are worrying now that you don't work at a Pixar  or you don't work at a Google  I want to tell you there's still hope. We've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens. We studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers     competitors  to collaborate and innovate. We studied the head of marketing at a German automaker where  fundamentally  they believed that it was the design engineers  not the marketeers  who were allowed to be innovative. We also studied Vineet Nayar at HCL Technologies  an Indian outsourcing company. When we met Vineet  his company was about  in his words  to become irrelevant. We watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of I.T. innovation. At HCL technologies  like at many companies  the leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction and making sure that no one deviated from it. What he did is tell them it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do. Because what was happening is that everybody was looking up and you weren't seeing the kind of bottom up innovation we saw at Pixar or Google. So they began to work on that. They stopped giving answers  they stopped trying to provide solutions. Instead  what they did is they began to see the people at the bottom of the pyramid  the young sparks  the people who were closest to the customers  as the source of innovation. They began to transfer the organization's growth to that level. In Vineet's language  this was about inverting the pyramid so that you could unleash the power of the many by loosening the stranglehold of the few  and increase the quality and the speed of innovation that was happening every day. For sure  Vineet and all the other leaders that we studied were in fact visionaries. For sure  they understood that that was not their role. So I don't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize Ed. Because Ed  like Vineet  understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage  not perform on it. If we want to invent a better future  and I suspect that's why many of us are here  then we need to reimagine our task. Our task is to create the space where everybody's slices of genius can be unleashed and harnessed  and turned into works of collective genius. Thank you. I cannot forget them. Their names were Aslan  Alik  Andrei  Fernanda  Fred  Galina  Gunnhild  Hans  Ingeborg  Matti  Natalya  Nancy  Sheryl  Usman  Zarema  and the list is longer. For many  their existence  their humanity  has been reduced to statistics  coldly recorded as  security incidents.  For me  they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers that tried to bring a bit of comfort to the victims of the wars in Chechnya in the '  s. They were nurses  logisticians  shelter experts  paralegals  interpreters. And for this service  they were murdered  their families torn apart  and their story largely forgotten. No one was ever sentenced for these crimes. I cannot forget them. They live in me somehow  their memories giving me meaning every day. But they are also haunting the dark street of my mind. As humanitarian aid workers  they made the choice to be at the side of the victim  to provide some assistance  some comfort  some protection  but when they needed protection themselves  it wasn't there. When you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in Iraq or in Syria    aid worker abducted  hostage executed    but who were they  Why were they there  What motivated them  How did we become so indifferent to these crimes  This is why I am here today with you. We need to find better ways to remember them. We also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives. We also need to demand justice. When in '   I was sent by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the North Caucasus  I knew some of the risks. Five colleagues had been killed  three had been seriously injured  seven had already been taken hostage. So we were careful. We were using armored  vehicles  decoy cars  changing patterns of travel  changing homes  all sorts of security measures. Yet on a cold winter night of January '    it was my turn. When I entered my flat in Vladikavkaz with a guard  we were surrounded by armed men. They took the guard  they put him on the floor  they beat him up in front of me  tied him  dragged him away. I was handcuffed  blindfolded  and forced to kneel  as the silencer of a gun pressed against my neck. When it happens to you  there is no time for thinking  no time for praying. My brain went on automatic  rewinding quickly the life I'd just left behind. It took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men there were not there to kill me  but that someone  somewhere  had ordered my kidnapping. Then a process of dehumanization started that day. I was no more than just a commodity. I normally don't talk about this  but I'd like to share a bit with you some of those     days of captivity. I was kept in an underground cellar  total darkness  for    hours and    minutes every day  and then the guards  would come  normally two. They would bring a big piece of bread  a bowl of soup  and a candle. That candle would burn for    minutes     minutes of precious light  and then they would take it away  and I returned to darkness. I was chained by a metal cable to my bed. I could do only four small steps. I always dreamt of the fifth one. And no TV  no radio  no newspaper  no one to talk to. I had no towel  no soap  no toilet paper  just two metal buckets open  one for water  for one waste. Can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic or when they are just bored or drunk  We are breaking my nerves very slowly. Isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe. How do you describe nothing  There are no words for the depths of loneliness I reached in that very thin border between sanity and madness. In the darkness  sometimes I played imaginary games of checkers. I would start with the black  play with the white  back to the black trying to trick the other side. I don't play checkers anymore. I was tormented by the thoughts of my family and my colleague  the guard  Edik. I didn't know what had happened to him. I was trying not to think  I tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot. I tried to pray  I tried all sorts of memorization games. But darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal. One part of your brain wants you to resist  to shout  to cry  and the other part of the brain orders you to shut up and just go through it. It's a constant internal debate  there is no one to arbitrate. Once a guard came to me  very aggressively  and he told me   Today you're going to kneel and beg for your food.  I wasn't in a good mood  so I insulted him. I insulted his mother  I insulted his ancestors. The consequence was moderate  he threw the food into my waste. The day after he came back with the same demand. He got the same answer  which had the same consequence. Four days later  the body was full of pain. I didn't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little. So when the guards came down  I knelt. I begged for my food. Submission was the only way for me to make it to another candle. After my kidnapping  I was transferred from North Ossetia to Chechnya  three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars  and upon arrival  I was interrogated for    days by a guy called Ruslan. The routine was always the same  a bit more light     minutes. He would come down to the cellar  he would ask the guards to tie me on the chair  and he would turn on the music loud. And then he would yell questions. He would scream. He would beat me. I'll spare you the details. There are many questions I could not understand  and there are some questions I did not want to understand. The length of the interrogation was the duration of the tape     songs     minutes. I would always long for the last song. On one day  one night in that cellar  I don't know what it was  I heard a child crying above my head  a boy  maybe two or three years old. Footsteps  confusion  people running. So when Ruslan came the day after  before he put the first question to me  I asked him   How is your son today  Is he feeling better   Ruslan was taken by surprise. He was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life. I kept talking about NGOs supplying medicines to local clinics that may help his son to get better. And we talked about education  we talked about families. He talked to me about his children. I talked to him about my daughters. And then he'd talk about guns  about cars  about women  and I had to talk about guns  about cars  about women. And we talked until the last song on the tape. Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met. He did not touch me anymore. He did not ask any other questions. I was no longer just a commodity. Two days after  I was transferred to another place. There  a guard came to me  very close    it was quite unusual    and he said with a very soft voice  he said   I'd like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby Dagestan.  What could I possibly reply  It was so painful. It was like a blade in the belly. It took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became. He was young  he was shy. I never saw his face. He probably meant well. But in those    seconds  he made me question everything we did  all the sacrifices. He made me think also how they see us. Until then  I had assumed that they know why we are there and what we are doing. One cannot assume this. Well  explaining why we do this is not that easy  even to our closest relatives. We are not perfect  we are not superior  we are not the world's fire brigade  we are not superheroes  we don't stop wars  we know that humanitarian response is not a substitute for political solution. Yet we do this because one life matters. Sometimes that's the only difference you make    one individual  one family  a small group of individuals    and it matters. When you have a tsunami  an earthquake or a typhoon  you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the world  searching for survivors for weeks. Why  Nobody questions this. Every life matters  or every life should matter. This is the same for us when we help refugees  people displaced within their country by conflict  or stateless persons  I know many people  when they are confronted by overwhelming suffering  they feel powerless and they stop there. It's a pity  because there are so many ways people can help. We don't stop with that feeling. We try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance  some protection  some comfort. We have to. We can't do otherwise. It's what makes us feel  I don't know  simply human. That's a picture of me the day of my release. Months after my release  I met the then French prime minister. The second thing he told me   You were totally irresponsible to go to the North Caucasus. You don't know how many problems you've created for us.  It was a short meeting. I think helping people in danger is responsible. In that war  that nobody seriously wanted to stop  and we have many of these today  bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity  it was making a real difference for the people. Why could he not understand this  We have a responsibility to try. You've heard about that concept  Responsibility to Protect. Outcomes may depend on various parameters. We may even fail  but there is worse than failing    it's not even trying when we can. Well  if you are met this way  if you sign up for this sort of job  your life is going to be full of joy and sadness  because there are a lot of people we cannot help  a lot of people we cannot protect  a lot of people we did not save. I call them my ghost  and by having witnessed their suffering from close  you take a bit  of that suffering on yourself. Many young humanitarian workers go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness. They are thrown into situations where they are witness  but they are powerless to bring any change. They have to learn to accept it and gradually turn this into positive energy. It's difficult. Many don't succeed  but for those who do  there is no other job like this. You can see the difference you make every day. Humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in conflict areas or  in post conflict environments  yet our life  our job  is becoming  increasingly life threatening  and the sanctity of our life is fading. Do you know that since the millennium  the number of attacks on humanitarian  aid workers has tripled       broke new records      colleagues killed      seriously wounded      abducted. So many broken lives. Until the beginning of the civil war in Somalia in the late '  s  humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims of what we call collateral damages  but by and large we were not the target of these attacks. This has changed. Look at this picture. Baghdad  August          colleagues were killed. Gone are the days when a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross would automatically protect us. Criminal groups and some political groups have cross fertilized over the last    years  and they've created these sort of hybrids with whom we have no way of communicating. Humanitarian principles are tested  questioned  and often ignored  but perhaps more importantly  we have abandoned the search for justice. There seems to be no consequence whatsoever for attacks against humanitarian aid workers. After my release  I was told not to seek any form of justice. It won't do you any good  that's what I was told. Plus  you're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues. It took me years to see the sentencing of three people associated  with my kidnapping  but this was the exception. There was no justice for any  of the humanitarian aid workers killed or abducted in Chechnya between '   and '    and it's the same all over the world. This is unacceptable. This is inexcusable. Attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law. Those crimes should not go unpunished. We must end this cycle of impunity. We must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself. That makes me furious. I know I'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for. I don't know what it is to have seen my whole town destroyed. I don't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me. I don't know what it is to lose the protection of my country. I also know that I'm very lucky compared to other hostages. Four days before my eventful release  four hostages were beheaded a few miles away from where I was kept in captivity. Why them  Why am I here today  No easy answer. I was received with a lot of support that I got from my relatives  from colleagues  from friends  from people I didn't know. They have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness. Not everyone was treated with the same attention. How many of my colleagues  after a traumatic incident  took their own life  I can count nine that I knew personally. How many of my colleagues went through a difficult divorce after a traumatic experience because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse  I've lost that count. There is a price for this type of life. In Russia  all war monuments have this beautiful inscription at the top. It says   In Russian   No one is forgotten  nothing is forgotten.  I do not forget my lost colleagues. I cannot forget anything. I call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better protected. We should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off. After my ordeal  a lot of colleagues asked me   But why do you continue  Why do you do this sort of job  Why do you have to go back to it   My answer was very simple  If I had quit  that would have meant my kidnapper had won. They would have taken my soul and my humanity. Thank you. How many people here have heard of PMS  Everybody  right  Everyone knows that women go a little crazy right before they get their period  that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster of irrationality and irritability. There's a general assumption that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions and that the great majority of women are affected by this. Well  I am here to tell you that scientific evidence says neither of those assumptions is true. I'm here to give you  the good news about PMS. But first  let's take a look at how firmly the idea of PMS is entrenched in American culture. If you examine newspaper or magazine articles  you'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS. In an article in the magazine Redbook titled  You  PMS Free   readers were informed that between     to    percent of women suffer from PMS. L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers that    to    percent of women suffer from PMS  and that it plays a major role in women's mental and physical health  and a couple of years ago  even the Wall Street Journal ran an article on calcium as a treatment for PMS  asking its female readers   Do you turn into a witch every month   From all these articles  you would think there must be a mountain of research verifying the widespread nature of PMS. However  after five decades of research  there's no strong consensus on the definition  the cause  the treatment  or even  the existence of PMS. As most commonly defined by psychologists  PMS involves negative behavioral  cognitive and physical symptoms from the time of ovulation to menstruation. But here's where it gets tricky. Over     different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS  and here are just a few of those. Now  I want to be clear here. I'm not saying women don't get some of these symptoms. What I'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms doesn't amount to a mental disorder  and when psychologists come up with a disorder that's so vaguely defined  the label eventually becomes meaningless. With a list of symptoms this long and wide  I could have PMS  you could have PMS  the guy in the third row here could have PMS  my dog could have PMS.  Laughter  Some researchers said you had to have five symptoms. Some said three. Other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful if they were highly disturbing to you  but others said minor symptoms were just as important. For many years  because there was no standardization in the definition of PMS  when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates  their estimates ranged from five percent of women to    percent of women  so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had PMS. Overall  the weaknesses in the methods of research on PMS have been considerable. First  many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively  looking to the past and relying on memory  which is known to inflate reporting of PMS compared to what's called prospective reporting  which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms for at least two months in a row. Many studies also exclusively focused on white  middle class women  which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women. We know there's a strong cultural component to the belief in PMS because it's nearly unheard of outside of Western nations. Third  many studies failed to use control groups. If we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have PMS  we need to be able to compare them to women who don't have PMS. And finally  many different types of questionnaires were used to diagnose PMS  focusing on different symptoms  symptom duration and severity. To do reliable research on any condition  scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition so they're all talking about the same thing  and with PMS  this has not been the case. However  in       the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  known as the DSM  thankfully    it's also the manual for mental health professionals    they redefined PMS as PMDD  Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. And dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease. And according to these new DSM guidelines  in most menstrual cycles in the last year  at least five of    possible symptoms must appear in the week before menstruation starts  the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun  and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended. One of these symptoms must come from this list of four  marked mood swings  irritability  anxiety  or depression. The other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide  including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appetite. The DSM also required now that the symptoms should be associated with clinically significant distress    there should be some kind of disturbance in work or school or social relationships    and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row. And finally  the DSM required that the emotional disturbance should be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder. So scientifically speaking  this is an improvement. We now have a limited number of symptoms  and a high impact on functioning that's required  and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific. Well  using this criteria and looking at most recent studies  we see that on average  three to eight percent of women suffer from PMDD. Not all women  not most women  not the majority of women  not even a lot of women  three to eight percent. For everyone else  variables like stressful events or happy occasions or even day of the week are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month  and this is the information the scientific community has had since the     s. In       my colleagues and I published an article describing the PMS and PMDD research  and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals. The questions is  why hasn't this information trickled down to the public  Why do these myths persist  Well  certainly the onslaught of messages that women receive from books  TV  movies  the Internet  that everyone gets PMS go a long way in convincing them it must be true. Research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets PMS  the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it. Let me tell you what I mean by  erroneously.  You might ask her   Do you have PMS   and she says yes  but then  when you have her  keep a daily log of psychological symptoms for two months  no correlation is found between her symptoms and time of the month. Another reason for the persistence of the PMS myth has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role. Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler have suggested that taking on the label of PMS allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered unladylike. The near universal definition of a good woman is one who is happy  loving  caring for others  and taking great satisfaction from that role. Well  PMS has become a permission slip to be angry  complain  be irritated  without losing the title of good woman. We know that the variables in a woman's environment are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones  but when she attributes anger to hormones  she's absolved of responsibility or criticism.  Oh  that's not who she is. It's out of her control.  And while this can be a useful tool  it serves to invalidate women's emotions. When people respond to a woman's anger with the thought   Oh  it's just that time of the month   her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited. So who else benefits from the myth of PMS  Well  I can tell you that treating PMS has become a profitable   thriving industry. Amazon.com currently offers over       books on PMS treatment. A quick Google search will bring up a cornucopia of clinics  workshops and seminars. Reputable Internet sources of medical information like WebMD or the Mayo Clinic list PMS as a known disorder. It's not a known disorder  but they list it. And they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it  like anti depressants or hormones. Interestingly  though  both websites say that the success of medication in treating PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman. Well  that doesn't make sense. If you've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause  which PMS is supposed to be  then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women. This has not been the case with these treatments  and FDA regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective  a large portion of the target population should see clinically significant improvement. So we have not had that at all with these so called treatments. However  the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that PMS is a common mental disorder and is treatable is quite substantial. When women are prescribed drugs like anti depressants or hormones  medical protocol requires that they have physician follow up every three months. That's a lot of doctor visits. Pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication for all of their child bearing lives. Over the counter drugs like Midol even claim to treat PMS symptoms like tension and irritability  even though they only contain a diuretic  a pain reliever and caffeine. Now  far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine  but I don't think reducing tension is one of them. Since       Midol has marketed a Teen Midol to adolescents. They are aiming at young girls early  to convince them that everyone gets PMS and that it will make you a monster  but wait  there's something you can do about it  Take Midol and you will be a human being again. In       Midol took in    million dollars in sales revenue. So while perpetuating the myth of PMS has been lucrative for some  it comes with some serious adverse consequences for women. First  it contributes to the medicalization of women's reproductive health. The medical field has a long history of conceptualizing women's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment  and this has come at many costs  including excessive Cesarean deliveries  hysterectomies and prescribed hormone treatments that have harmed rather than enhanced women's health. Second  the PMS myth also contributes to the stereotype of women as irrational and overemotional. When the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster that turns women into angry beasts  it becomes easy to question  the competence of all women. Women have made tremendous strides in the workforce  but still there's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons of fields like government or business  and when we think about who makes for a good CEO or senator  someone who has qualities like  rationality  steadiness  competence come to mind  and in our culture  that sounds more like a man than a woman  and the PMS myth contributes to that. Psychologists know that the moods of men and women are more similar than different. One study followed men and women for four to six months and found that the number of mood swings they experienced and the severity of those mood swings were no different. And finally  the PMS myth keeps women from dealing with the actual issues causing them emotional upset. Individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty are all strongly related to daily mood. Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions  but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them. So the good news about PMS is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle  the great majority don't get a mental disorder. They go to work or school  take care of their families  and function at a normal level. We know the emotions and moods of men and women are more similar than different  so let's walk away from the tired old PMS myth of women as witches and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning the great majority of women live every day. Thank you. We are built out of very small stuff  and we are embedded in a very large cosmos  and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at either of those scales  and that's because our brains haven't evolved to understand  the world at that scale. Instead  we're trapped on this very thin slice of perception right in the middle. But it gets strange  because even at  that slice of reality that we call home  we're not seeing most of the action that's going on. So take the colors of our world. This is light waves  electromagnetic radiation that bounces off objects and it hits specialized receptors in the back of our eyes. But we're not seeing all the waves out there. In fact  what we see is less than a    trillionth of what's out there. So you have radio waves and microwaves and X rays and gamma rays passing through your body right now and you're completely unaware of it  because you don't come with the proper biological receptors for picking it up. There are thousands of cell phone conversations passing through you right now  and you're utterly blind to it. Now  it's not that these things are inherently unseeable. Snakes include some infrared in their reality  and honeybees include ultraviolet in their view of the world  and of course we build machines in the dashboards of our cars to pick up on signals in the radio frequency range  and we built machines in hospitals to pick up on the X ray range. But you can't sense any of those by yourself  at least not yet  because you don't come equipped with the proper sensors. Now  what this means is that our experience of reality is constrained by our biology  and that goes against the common sense notion that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips are just picking up the objective reality that's out there. Instead  our brains are sampling just a little bit of the world. Now  across the animal kingdom  different animals pick up on different parts of reality. So in the blind and deaf world of the tick  the important signals are temperature and butyric acid  in the world of the black ghost knifefish  its sensory world is lavishly colored by electrical fields  and for the echolocating bat  its reality is constructed out of air compression waves. That's the slice of their ecosystem that they can pick up on  and we have a word for this in science. It's called the umwelt  which is the German word for the surrounding world. Now  presumably  every animal assumes that its umwelt is the entire objective reality out there  because why would you ever stop to imagine that there's something beyond what we can sense. Instead  what we all do is we accept reality as it's presented to us. Let's do a consciousness raiser on this. Imagine that you are a bloodhound dog. Your whole world is about smelling. You've got a long snout that has     million scent receptors in it  and you have wet nostrils that attract and trap scent molecules  and your nostrils even have slits so you can take big nosefuls of air. Everything is about smell for you. So one day  you stop in your tracks with a revelation. You look at your human owner and you think   What is it like to have the pitiful  impoverished nose of a human  What is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air  How can you not know that there's a cat     yards away  or that your neighbor was on this very spot six hours ago   So because we're humans  we've never experienced that world of smell  so we don't miss it  because we are firmly settled into our umwelt. But the question is  do we have to be stuck there  So as a neuroscientist  I'm interested in the way that technology might expand our umwelt  and how that's going to change the experience of being human. So we already know that we can marry our technology to our biology  because there are hundreds of thousands of people walking around with artificial hearing and artificial vision. So the way this works is  you take a microphone and you digitize the signal  and you put an electrode strip directly into the inner ear. Or  with the retinal implant  you take a camera and you digitize the signal  and then you plug an electrode grid directly into the optic nerve. And as recently as    years ago  there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn't work. Why  It's because these technologies speak the language of Silicon Valley  and it's not exactly the same dialect as our natural biological sense organs. But the fact is that it works  the brain figures out how to use the signals just fine. Now  how do we understand that  Well  here's the big secret  Your brain is not hearing or seeing any of this. Your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull. All it ever sees are electrochemical signals that come in along different data cables  and this is all it has to work with  and nothing more. Now  amazingly  the brain is really good at taking in these signals and extracting patterns and assigning meaning  so that it takes this inner cosmos and puts together a story of this  your subjective world. But here's the key point  Your brain doesn't know  and it doesn't care  where it gets the data from. Whatever information comes in  it just figures out what to do with it. And this is a very efficient kind of machine. It's essentially a general purpose computing device  and it just takes in everything and figures out what it's going to do with it  and that  I think  frees up Mother Nature to tinker around with different sorts of input channels. So I call this the P.H.  model of evolution  and I don't want to get too technical here  but P.H. stands for Potato Head  and I use this name to emphasize that all these sensors that we know and love  like our eyes and our ears and our fingertips  these are merely peripheral plug and play devices  You stick them in  and you're good to go. The brain figures out what to do with the data that comes in. And when you look across the animal kingdom  you find lots of peripheral devices. So snakes have heat pits with which to detect infrared  and the ghost knifefish has electroreceptors  and the star nosed mole has this appendage with    fingers on it with which it feels around and constructs a  D model of the world  and many birds have magnetite so they can orient to the magnetic field of the planet. So what this means is that nature doesn't have to continually redesign the brain. Instead  with the principles of brain operation established  all nature has to worry about is designing new peripherals. Okay. So what this means is this  The lesson that surfaces is that there's nothing really special or fundamental about the biology that we come to the table with. It's just what we have inherited from a complex road of evolution. But it's not what we have to stick with  and our best proof of principle of this comes from what's called sensory substitution. And that refers to feeding information into the brain via unusual sensory channels  and the brain just figures out what to do with it. Now  that might sound speculative  but the first paper demonstrating this was published in the journal Nature in     . So a scientist named Paul Bach y Rita put blind people in a modified dental chair  and he set up a video feed  and he put something in front of the camera  and then you would feel that poked into your back with a grid of solenoids. So if you wiggle a coffee cup in front of the camera  you're feeling that in your back  and amazingly  blind people got pretty good at being able to determine what was in front of the camera just by feeling it in the small of their back. Now  there have been many modern incarnations of this. The sonic glasses take a video feed right in front of you and turn that into a sonic landscape  so as things move around  and get closer and farther  it sounds like  Bzz  bzz  bzz.  It sounds like a cacophony  but after several weeks  blind people start getting pretty good at understanding what's in front of them just based on what they're hearing. And it doesn't have to be through the ears  this system uses an electrotactile grid on the forehead  so whatever's in front of the video feed  you're feeling it on your forehead. Why the forehead  Because you're not using it for much else. The most modern incarnation is called the brainport  and this is a little electrogrid that sits on your tongue  and the video feed gets turned into these little electrotactile signals  and blind people get so good at using this that they can throw a ball into a basket  or they can navigate complex obstacle courses. They can come to see through their tongue. Now  that sounds completely insane  right  But remember  all vision ever is is electrochemical signals coursing around in your brain. Your brain doesn't know where the signals come from. It just figures out what to do with them. So my interest in my lab is sensory substitution for the deaf  and this is a project I've undertaken with a graduate student in my lab  Scott Novich  who is spearheading this for his thesis. And here is what we wanted to do  we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted in some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said. And we wanted to do this  given the power and ubiquity of portable computing  we wanted to make sure that this would run on cell phones and tablets  and also we wanted to make this a wearable  something that you could wear under your clothing. So here's the concept. So as I'm speaking  my sound is getting captured by the tablet  and then it's getting mapped onto a vest that's covered in vibratory motors  just like the motors in your cell phone. So as I'm speaking  the sound is getting translated to a pattern of vibration on the vest. Now  this is not just conceptual  this tablet is transmitting Bluetooth  and I'm wearing the vest right now. So as I'm speaking     Applause     the sound is getting translated into dynamic patterns of vibration. I'm feeling the sonic world around me. So  we've been testing this with deaf people now  and it turns out that after just a little bit of time  people can start feeling  they can start understanding the language of the vest. So this is Jonathan. He's    years old. He has a master's degree. He was born profoundly deaf  which means that there's a part of his umwelt that's unavailable to him. So we had Jonathan train with the vest for four days  two hours a day  and here he is on the fifth day. Scott Novich  You. David Eagleman  So Scott says a word  Jonathan feels it on the vest  and he writes it on the board. SN  Where. Where. DE  Jonathan is able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations into an understanding of what's being said. SN  Touch. Touch. DE  Now  he's not doing this    Jonathan is not doing this consciously  because the patterns are too complicated  but his brain is starting to unlock the pattern that allows it to figure out what the data mean  and our expectation is that  after wearing this for about three months  he will have a direct perceptual experience of hearing in the same way that when a blind person passes a finger over braille  the meaning comes directly off the page without any conscious intervention at all. Now  this technology has the potential to be a game changer  because the only other solution for deafness is a cochlear implant  and that requires an invasive surgery. And this can be built for    times cheaper than a cochlear implant  which opens up this technology globally  even for the poorest countries. Now  we've been very encouraged by our results with sensory substitution  but what we've been thinking a lot about is sensory addition. How could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense  to expand the human umvelt  For example  could we feed real time data from the Internet directly into somebody's brain  and can they develop a direct perceptual experience  So here's an experiment we're doing in the lab. A subject is feeling a real time streaming feed from the Net of data for five seconds. Then  two buttons appear  and he has to make a choice. He doesn't know what's going on. He makes a choice  and he gets feedback after one second. Now  here's the thing  The subject has no idea what all the patterns mean  but we're seeing if he gets better at figuring out which button to press. He doesn't know that what we're feeding is real time data from the stock market  and he's making buy and sell decisions. And the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not. And what we're seeing is  can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have  after several weeks  a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet. So we'll report on that later to see how well this goes. Here's another thing we're doing  During the talks this morning  we've been automatically scraping Twitter for the TED     hashtag  and we've been doing an automated sentiment analysis  which means  are people using positive words or negative words or neutral  And while this has been going on  I have been feeling this  and so I am plugged in to the aggregate emotion of thousands of people in real time  and that's a new kind of human experience  because now I can know how everyone's doing and how much you're loving this. It's a bigger experience than a human can normally have. We're also expanding the umvelt of pilots. So in this case  the vest is streaming nine different measures from this quadcopter  so pitch and yaw and roll and orientation and heading  and that improves this pilot's ability to fly it. It's essentially like he's extending his skin up there  far away. And that's just the beginning. What we're envisioning is taking a modern cockpit full of gauges and instead of trying to read the whole thing  you feel it. We live in a world of information now  and there is a difference between accessing big data and experiencing it. So I think there's really no end to the possibilities on the horizon for human expansion. Just imagine an astronaut being able to feel the overall health of the International Space Station  or  for that matter  having you feel the invisible states of your own health  like your blood sugar and the state of your microbiome  or having     degree vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet. So the key is this  As we move into the future  we're going to increasingly be able to choose our own peripheral devices. We no longer have to wait for Mother Nature's sensory gifts on her timescales  but instead  like any good parent  she's given us the tools that we need to go out and define our own trajectory. So the question now is  how do you want to go out and experience your universe  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Can you feel it  DE  Yeah. Actually  this was the first time I felt applause on the vest. It's nice. It's like a massage.  Laughter  CA  Twitter's going crazy. Twitter's going mad. So that stock market experiment. This could be the first experiment that secures its funding forevermore  right  if successful  DE  Well  that's right  I wouldn't have to write to NIH anymore. CA  Well look  just to be skeptical for a minute  I mean  this is amazing  but isn't most of the evidence so far that sensory substitution works  not necessarily  that sensory addition works  I mean  isn't it possible that the blind person can see through their tongue because the visual cortex is still there  ready to process  and that that is needed as part of it  DE  That's a great question. We actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in. The general story  though  is that it's extraordinarily flexible. So when a person goes blind  what we used to call their visual cortex gets taken over by other things  by touch  by hearing  by vocabulary. So what that tells us is that the cortex is kind of a one trick pony. It just runs certain kinds of computations on things. And when we look around at things like braille  for example  people are getting information through bumps on their fingers. So I don't think we have any reason to think there's a theoretical limit that we know the edge of. CA  If this checks out  you're going to be deluged. There are so many possible applications for this. Are you ready for this  What are you most excited about  the direction it might go  DE  I mean  I think there's a lot of applications here. In terms of beyond sensory substitution  the things I started mentioning about astronauts on the space station  they spend a lot of their time monitoring things  and they could instead just get what's going on  because what this is really good for is multidimensional data. The key is this  Our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges  but they're really bad at what our world has become  which is screens with lots and lots of data. We have to crawl that with our attentional systems. So this is a way of just feeling the state of something  just like the way you know the state of your body as you're standing around. So I think heavy machinery  safety  feeling the state of a factory  of your equipment  that's one place it'll go right away. CA  David Eagleman  that was one mind blowing talk. Thank you very much. DE  Thank you  Chris.  Applause  I'm thrilled to be here tonight to share with you something we've been working on for over two years  and it's in the area of additive manufacturing  also known as  D printing. You see this object here. It looks fairly simple  but it's quite complex at the same time. It's a set of concentric geodesic structures with linkages between each one. In its context  it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques. It has a symmetry such that you can't injection mold it. You can't even manufacture it through milling. This is a job for a  D printer  but most  D printers would take between three and    hours to fabricate it  and we're going to take the risk tonight to try to fabricate it onstage during this    minute talk. Wish us luck. Now   D printing is actually a misnomer. It's actually  D printing over and over again  and it in fact uses the technologies associated with  D printing. Think about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page to make letters  and then do that over and over again to build up a three dimensional object. In microelectronics  they use something called lithography to do the same sort of thing  to make the transistors and integrated circuits and build up a structure several times. These are all  D printing technologies. Now  I'm a chemist  a material scientist too  and my co inventors are also material scientists  one a chemist  one a physicist  and we began to be interested in  D printing. And very often  as you know  new ideas are often simple connections between people with different experiences in different communities  and that's our story. Now  we were inspired by the  Terminator    scene for T       and we thought  why couldn't a  D printer operate in this fashion  where you have an object arise out of a puddle in essentially real time with essentially no waste to make a great object  Okay  just like the movies. And could we be inspired by Hollywood and come up with ways to actually try to get this to work  And that was our challenge. And our approach would be  if we could do this  then we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back  D printing from being a manufacturing process. One   D printing takes forever. There are mushrooms that grow faster than  D printed parts.  Laughter  The layer by layer process leads to defects in mechanical properties  and if we could grow continuously  we could eliminate those defects. And in fact  if we could grow really fast  we could also start using materials that are self curing  and we could have amazing properties. So if we could pull this off  imitate Hollywood  we could in fact address  D manufacturing. Our approach is to use some standard knowledge in polymer chemistry to harness light and oxygen to grow parts continuously. Light and oxygen work in different ways. Light can take a resin and convert it to a solid  can convert a liquid to a solid. Oxygen inhibits that process. So light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another from a chemical point of view  and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen  we could control this process. And we refer to this as CLIP.  Continuous Liquid Interface Production.  It has three functional components. One  it has a reservoir that holds the puddle  just like the T     . At the bottom of the reservoir is a special window. I'll come back to that. In addition  it has a stage that will lower into the puddle and pull the object out of the liquid. The third component is a digital light projection system underneath the reservoir  illuminating with light in the ultraviolet region. Now  the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir  it's a composite  it's a very special window. It's not only transparent to light but it's permeable to oxygen. It's got characteristics like a contact lens. So we can see how the process works. You can start to see that as you lower a stage in there  in a traditional process  with an oxygen impermeable window  you make a two dimensional pattern and you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window  and so in order to introduce the next layer  you have to separate it  introduce new resin  reposition it  and do this process over and over again. But with our very special window  what we're able to do is  with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it  that oxygen inhibits the reaction  and we form a dead zone. This dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick  so that's two or three diameters of a red blood cell  right at the window interface that remains a liquid  and we pull this object up  and as we talked about in a Science paper  as we change the oxygen content  we can change the dead zone thickness. And so we have a number of key variables that we control  oxygen content  the light  the light intensity  the dose to cure  the viscosity  the geometry  and we use very sophisticated software to control this process. The result is pretty staggering. It's    to     times faster than traditional  D printers  which is game changing. In addition  as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface  we can go       times faster I believe  and that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of heat  and as a chemical engineer  I get very excited at heat transfer and the idea that we might one day have water cooled  D printers  because they're going so fast. In addition  because we're growing things  we eliminate the layers  and the parts are monolithic. You don't see the surface structure. You have molecularly smooth surfaces. And the mechanical properties of most parts made in a  D printer are notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation with which how you printed it  because of the layer like structure. But when you grow objects like this  the properties are invariant with the print direction. These look like injection molded parts  which is very different than traditional  D manufacturing. In addition  we're able to throw the entire polymer chemistry textbook at this  and we're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties you really want in a  D printed object. There it is. That's great. You always take the risk that something like this won't work onstage  right  But we can have materials with great mechanical properties. For the first time  we can have elastomers that are high elasticity or high dampening. Think about vibration control or great sneakers  for example. We can make materials that have incredible strength  high strength to weight ratio  really strong materials  really great elastomers  so throw that in the audience there. So great material properties. And so the opportunity now  if you actually make a part that has the properties to be a final part  and you do it in game changing speeds  you can actually transform manufacturing. Right now  in manufacturing  what happens is  the so called digital thread in digital manufacturing. We go from a CAD drawing  a design  to a prototype to manufacturing. Often  the digital thread is broken right at prototype  because you can't go all the way to manufacturing because most parts don't have the properties to be a final part. We now can connect the digital thread all the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing  and that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things  from better fuel efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties with high strength to weight ratio  new turbine blades  all sorts of wonderful things. Think about if you need a stent in an emergency situation  instead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf that was just standard sizes  having a stent that's designed for you  for your own anatomy with your own tributaries  printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties such that the stent could go away after    months  really game changing. Or digital dentistry  and making these kinds of structures even while you're in the dentist chair. And look at the structures that my students are making at the University of North Carolina. These are amazing microscale structures. You know  the world is really good at nano fabrication. Moore's Law has driven things from    microns and below. We're really good at that  but it's actually very hard to make things from    microns to       microns  the mesoscale. And subtractive techniques from the silicon industry can't do that very well. They can't etch wafers that well. But this process is so gentle  we can grow these objects up from the bottom using additive manufacturing and make amazing things in tens of seconds  opening up new sensor technologies  new drug delivery techniques  new lab on a chip applications  really game changing stuff. So the opportunity of making a part in real time that has the properties to be a final part really opens up  D manufacturing  and for us  this is very exciting  because this really is owning the intersection between hardware  software and molecular science  and I can't wait to see what designers and engineers around the world are going to be able to do with this great tool. Thanks for listening. You're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade. Obviously  that's changed  but only recently. It was several months ago that I gave my very first major public talk at the Forbes    Under    summit        brilliant people  all under the age of   . That meant that in       the oldest among the group were only     and the youngest  just four. I joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs. Yes  I'm in rap songs. Almost    rap songs.  Laughter  But the night of my speech  a surprising thing happened. At the age of     I was hit on by a    year old guy. I know  right  He was charming and I was flattered  and I declined. You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was  He could make me feel    again. I realized later that night  I'm probably the only person over    who does not want to be    again. At the age of     I fell in love with my boss  and at the age of     I learned the devastating consequences. Can I see a show of hands of anyone here who didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at     Yep. That's what I thought. So like me  at     a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person  maybe even your boss. Unlike me  though  your boss probably wasn't the president of the United States of America. Of course  life is full of surprises. Not a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake  and I regret that mistake deeply. In       after having been swept up into an improbable romance  I was then swept up into the eye of a political  legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before. Remember  just a few years earlier  news was consumed from just three places  reading a newspaper or magazine  listening to the radio  or watching television. That was it. But that wasn't my fate. Instead  this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution. That meant we could access all the information we wanted  when we wanted it  anytime  anywhere  and when the story broke in January       it broke online. It was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the Internet for a major news story  a click that reverberated around the world. What that meant for me personally was that overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide. I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously. This rush to judgment  enabled by technology  led to mobs of virtual stone throwers. Granted  it was before social media  but people could still comment online  email stories  and  of course  email cruel jokes. News sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers  banner ads online  and to keep people tuned to the TV. Do you recall a particular image of me  say  wearing a beret  Now  I admit I made mistakes  especially wearing that beret. But the attention and judgment that I received  not the story  but that I personally received  was unprecedented. I was branded as a tramp  tart  slut  whore  bimbo  and  of course  that woman. I was seen by many but actually known by few. And I get it  it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional  had a soul  and was once unbroken. When this happened to me    years ago  there was no name for it. Now we call it cyberbullying and online harassment. Today  I want to share some of my experience with you  talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations  and how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others. In       I lost my reputation and my dignity. I lost almost everything  and I almost lost my life. Let me paint a picture for you. It is September of     . I'm sitting in a windowless office room inside the Office of the Independent Counsel underneath humming fluorescent lights. I'm listening to the sound of my voice  my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before. I'm here because I've been legally required to personally authenticate all    hours of taped conversation. For the past eight months  the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the Sword of Damocles over my head. I mean  who can remember what they said a year ago  Scared and mortified  I listen  listen as I prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day  listen as I confess my love for the president  and  of course  my heartbreak  listen to my sometimes catty  sometimes churlish  sometimes silly self being cruel  unforgiving  uncouth  listen  deeply  deeply ashamed  to the worst version of myself  a self I don't even recognize. A few days later  the Starr Report is released to Congress  and all of those tapes and transcripts  those stolen words  form a part of it. That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough  but a few weeks later  the audio tapes are aired on TV  and significant portions made available online. The public humiliation was excruciating. Life was almost unbearable. This was not something that happened with regularity back then in       and by this  I mean the stealing of people's private words  actions  conversations or photos  and then making them public    public without consent  public without context  and public without compassion. Fast forward    years to       and now social media has been born. The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine  whether or not someone actually make a mistake  and now it's for both public and private people. The consequences for some have become dire  very dire. I was on the phone with my mom in September of       and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from Rutgers University named Tyler Clementi. Sweet  sensitive  creative Tyler was secretly webcammed by his roommate while being intimate with another man. When the online world learned of this incident  the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited. A few days later  Tyler jumped from  the George Washington Bridge to his death. He was   . My mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family  and she was gutted with pain in a way that I just couldn't quite understand  and then eventually I realized she was reliving       reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night  reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open  and reliving a time when both of my parents feared that I would be humiliated to death  literally. Today  too many parents haven't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones. Too many have learned of their child's suffering and humiliation after it was too late. Tyler's tragic  senseless death was a turning point for me. It served to recontextualize my experiences  and I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different. In       we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the Internet would take us. Since then  it has connected people in unimaginable ways  joining lost siblings  saving lives  launching revolutions  but the darkness  cyberbullying  and slut shaming that I experienced had mushroomed. Every day online  people  especially young people who are not developmentally equipped to handle this  are so abused and humiliated that they can't imagine living to the next day  and some  tragically  don't  and there's nothing virtual about that. ChildLine  a U.K. nonprofit that's focused on helping young people on various issues  released a staggering statistic late last year  From      to       there was an    percent increase in calls and emails related to cyberbullying. A meta analysis done out of the Netherlands showed that for the first time  cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying. And you know what shocked me  although it shouldn't have  was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion than either happiness or even anger. Cruelty to others is nothing new  but online  technologically enhanced shaming is amplified  uncontained  and permanently accessible. The echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family  village  school or community  but now it's the online community too. Millions of people  often anonymously  can stab you with their words  and that's a lot of pain  and there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stockade. There is a very personal price to public humiliation  and the growth of the Internet has jacked up that price. For nearly two decades now  we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil  both on  and offline. Gossip websites  paparazzi  reality programming  politics  news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame. It's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online which lends itself to trolling  invasion of privacy  and cyberbullying. This shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls a culture of humiliation. Consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone. Snapchat  the service which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the lifespan of a few seconds. You can imagine the range of content that that gets. A third party app which Snapchatters use to preserve the lifespan of the messages was hacked  and         personal conversations  photos  and videos were leaked online to now have a lifespan of forever. Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked  and private  intimate  nude photos were plastered across the Internet without their permission. One gossip website had over five million hits for this one story. And what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking  The documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value. But in this culture of humiliation  there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming. The price does not measure the cost to the victim  which Tyler and too many others  notably women  minorities  and members of the LGBTQ community have paid  but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them. This invasion of others is a raw material  efficiently and ruthlessly mined  packaged and sold at a profit. A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity and shame is an industry. How is the money made  Clicks. The more shame  the more clicks. The more clicks  the more advertising dollars. We're in a dangerous cycle. The more we click on this kind of gossip  the more numb we get to the human lives behind it  and the more numb we get  the more we click. All the while  someone is making money off of the back  of someone else's suffering. With every click  we make a choice. The more we saturate our culture with public shaming  the more accepted it is  the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying  trolling  some forms of hacking  and online harassment. Why  Because they all have humiliation at their cores. This behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created. Just think about it. Changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs. We've seen that to be true with racism  homophobia  and plenty of other biases  today and in the past. As we've changed beliefs about same sex marriage  more people have been offered equal freedoms. When we began valuing sustainability  more people began to recycle. So as far as our culture of humiliation goes  what we need is a cultural revolution. Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop  and it's time for an intervention on the Internet and in our culture. The shift begins with something simple  but it's not easy. We need to return to a long held value of compassion    compassion and empathy. Online  we've got a compassion deficit  an empathy crisis. Researcher Bren  Brown said  and I quote   Shame can't survive empathy.  Shame cannot survive empathy. I've seen some very dark days in my life  and it was the compassion and empathy from my family  friends  professionals  and sometimes even strangers that saved me. Even empathy from one person can make a difference. The theory of minority influence  proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici  says that even in small numbers  when there's consistency over time  change can happen. In the online world  we can foster minority influence by becoming upstanders. To become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy  we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation. Trust me  compassionate comments help abate the negativity. We can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these kinds of issues  like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the U.S.  In the U.K.  there's Anti Bullying Pro  and in Australia  there's Project Rockit. We talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression  but we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression. We all want to be heard  but let's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention. The Internet is  the superhighway for the id  but online  showing empathy to others benefits us all and helps create a safer and better world. We need to communicate online with compassion  consume news with compassion  and click with compassion. Just imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline. I'd like to end on a personal note. In the past nine months  the question I've been  asked the most is why. Why now  Why was I  sticking my head above the parapet  You can read between the lines in those questions  and the answer has nothing to do with politics. The top note answer was and is because it's time  time to stop tip toeing around my past  time to stop living a life of opprobrium  and time to take back my narrative. It's also not just about saving myself. Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing  You can survive it. I know it's hard. It may not be painless  quick or easy  but you can insist on a different ending to your story. Have compassion for yourself. We all deserve compassion  and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world. Thank you for listening. Let me show you something. The boy is petting the elephant. Those are people that are going on an airplane. That's a big airplane. Fei Fei Li  This is a three year old child describing what she sees in a series of photos. She might still have a lot to learn about this world  but she's already an expert at one very important task  to make sense of what she sees. Our society is more technologically advanced than ever. We send people to the moon  we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like. Yet  our most advanced machines and computers still struggle at this task. So I'm here today to give you a progress report on the latest advances in our research in computer vision  one of the most frontier and potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science. Yes  we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves  but without smart vision  they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road  which can be run over  and a rock that size  which should be avoided. We have made fabulous megapixel cameras  but we have not delivered sight to the blind. Drones can fly over massive land  but don't have enough vision technology to help us to track the changes of the rainforests. Security cameras are everywhere  but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool. Photos and videos are becoming an integral part of global life. They're being generated at a pace that's far beyond what any human  or teams of humans  could hope to view  and you and I are contributing to that at this TED. Yet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding and managing this enormous content. So in other words  collectively as a society  we're very much blind  because our smartest  machines are still blind.  Why is this so hard   you may ask. Cameras can take pictures like this one by converting lights into a two dimensional array of numbers known as pixels  but these are just lifeless numbers. They do not carry meaning in themselves. Just like to hear is not the same as to listen  to take pictures is not the same as to see  and by seeing  we really mean understanding. In fact  it took Mother Nature     million years of hard work to do this task  and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains  not the eyes themselves. So vision begins with the eyes  but it truly takes place in the brain. So for    years now  starting from my Ph.D. at Caltech and then leading Stanford's Vision Lab  I've been working with my mentors  collaborators and students to teach computers to see. Our research field is called computer vision and machine learning. It's part of the general field of artificial intelligence. So ultimately  we want to teach the machines to see just like we do  naming objects  identifying people  inferring  D geometry of things  understanding relations  emotions  actions and intentions. You and I weave together entire stories of people  places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them. The first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects  the building block of the visual world. In its simplest terms  imagine this teaching process as showing the computers some training images of a particular object  let's say cats  and designing a model that learns from these training images. How hard can this be  After all  a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors  and this is what we did in the early days of object modeling. We'd tell the computer algorithm in a mathematical language that a cat has a round face  a chubby body  two pointy ears  and a long tail  and that looked all fine. But what about this cat  It's all curled up. Now you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model. But what if cats are hidden  What about these silly cats  Now you get my point. Even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model  and that's just one object. So about eight years ago  a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking. No one tells a child how to see  especially in the early years. They learn this through real world experiences and examples. If you consider a child's eyes as a pair of biological cameras  they take one picture about every     milliseconds  the average time an eye movement is made. So by age three  a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world. That's a lot of training examples. So instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms  my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences in both quantity and quality. Once we know this  we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images than we have ever had before  perhaps thousands of times more  and together with Professor Kai Li at Princeton University  we launched the ImageNet project in     . Luckily  we didn't have to mount a camera on our head and wait for many years. We went to the Internet  the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created. We downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to help us to label these images. At its peak  ImageNet was one of the biggest employers of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers  together  almost        workers from     countries around the world helped us to clean  sort and label nearly a billion candidate images. That was how much effort it took to capture even a fraction of the imagery a child's mind takes in in the early developmental years. In hindsight  this idea of using big data to train computer algorithms may seem obvious now  but back in       it was not so obvious. We were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while. Some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure  and we were constantly struggling for research funding. Once  I even joked to my graduate students that I would just reopen my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet. After all  that's how I funded my college years. So we carried on. In       the ImageNet project delivered a database of    million images across        classes of objects and things organized by everyday English words. In both quantity and quality  this was an unprecedented scale. As an example  in the case of cats  we have more than        cats of all kinds of looks and poses and across all species of domestic and wild cats. We were thrilled to have put together ImageNet  and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it  so in the TED fashion  we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free. Now that we have the data to nourish our computer brain  we're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves. As it turned out  the wealth of information provided by ImageNet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called convolutional neural network  pioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima  Geoff Hinton  and Yann LeCun back in the     s and '  s. Just like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons  a basic operating unit in a neural network is a neuron like node. It takes input from other nodes and sends output to others. Moreover  these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers  also similar to the brain. In a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model  it has    million nodes      million parameters  and    billion connections. That's an enormous model. Powered by the massive data from ImageNet and the modern CPUs and GPUs to train such a humongous model  the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected. It became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition. This is a computer telling us this picture contains a cat and where the cat is. Of course there are more things than cats  so here's a computer algorithm telling us the picture contains a boy and a teddy bear  a dog  a person  and a small kite in the background  or a picture of very busy things like a man  a skateboard  railings  a lampost  and so on. Sometimes  when the computer is not so confident about what it sees  we have taught it to be smart enough to give us a safe answer instead of committing too much  just like we would do  but other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us what exactly the objects are  like the make  model  year of the cars. We applied this algorithm to millions of Google Street View images across hundreds of American cities  and we have learned something really interesting  first  it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household incomes. But surprisingly  car prices also correlate well with crime rates in cities  or voting patterns by zip codes. So wait a minute. Is that it  Has the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities  Not so fast. So far  we have just taught the computer to see objects. This is like a small child learning to utter a few nouns. It's an incredible accomplishment  but it's only the first step. Soon  another developmental milestone will be hit  and children begin to communicate in sentences. So instead of saying this is a cat in the picture  you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed. So to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences  the marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm has to take another step. Now  the computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by humans. Just like the brain integrates vision and language  we developed a model that connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences. About four months ago  we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models that is capable of generating a human like sentence when it sees a picture for the first time. Now  I'm ready to show you what the computer says when it sees the picture that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk. A large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway. FFL  Of course  we're still working hard to improve our algorithms  and it still has a lot to learn. And the computer still makes mistakes. FFL  So of course  when it sees too many cats  it thinks everything might look like a cat. FFL  Or  if it hasn't seen a toothbrush  it confuses it with a baseball bat. FFL  We haven't taught Art     to the computers. FFL  And it hasn't learned to appreciate the stunning beauty of nature like you and I do. So it has been a long journey. To get from age zero to three was hard. The real challenge is to go from three to    and far beyond. Let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the cake again. So far  we have taught the computer to see objects or even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture. FFL  But there's so much more  to this picture than just a person and a cake. What the computer doesn't see is that this is a special Italian cake that's only served during Easter time. The boy is wearing his favorite t shirt given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to Sydney  and you and I can all tell how happy he is and what's exactly on his mind at that moment. This is my son Leo. On my quest for visual intelligence  I think of Leo constantly and the future world he will live in. When machines can see  doctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose and take care of patients. Cars will run smarter and safer on the road. Robots  not just humans  will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded. We will discover new species   better materials  and explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines. Little by little  we're giving sight to the machines. First  we teach them to see. Then  they help us to see better. For the first time  human eyes won't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world. We will not only use the machines for their intelligence  we will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine. This is my quest  to give computers visual intelligence and to create a better future for Leo and for the world. Thank you.  Where are you from   said the pale  tattooed man.  Where are you from   It's September              days after the worst attack on America since World War II. Everyone wonders about the next plane. People are looking for scapegoats. The president   the night before  pledges to  bring our enemies to justice  or bring justice to our enemies.  And in the Dallas mini mart  a Dallas mini part surrounded by tire shops and strip joints a Bangladeshi immigrant  works the register. Back home  Raisuddin Bhuiyan was a big man  an Air Force officer. But he dreamed of a  fresh start in America. If he had to work briefly in a mini mart to save up for I.T. classes and his wedding in two months  so be it. Then  on September      that tattooed man enters the mart. He holds a shotgun. Raisuddin knows the drill  puts cash on the counter. This time  the man doesn't  touch the money.  Where are you from   he asks.  Excuse me   Raisuddin answers. His accent betrays him. The tattooed man  a self styled true American vigilante  shoots Raisuddin in revenge for     . Raisuddin feels millions of bees stinging his face. In fact  dozens of scalding   birdshot pellets puncture his head. Behind the counter  he lays in blood. He cups a hand over his forehead to keep in the brains on which he'd gambled everything. He recites verses from the Koran  begging his God to live. He senses he is dying. He didn't die. His right eye left him. His fianc e left him. His landlord  the mini mart owner  kicked him out. Soon he was homeless and         dollars in medical debt  including a fee for dialing  for an ambulance. But Raisuddin lived. And years later  he would ask what he could do to repay his God and become worthy of this second chance. He would come to believe  in fact  that this chance called for him to give a second chance to a man we might think deserved no chance at all. Twelve years ago  I was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world. Born in Ohio to Indian immigrants  I settled on the ultimate rebellion  against my parents  moving to the country they had worked so damn hard to get out of. What I thought might be a six month stint in Mumbai stretched to six years. I became a writer and found myself amid a magical story  the awakening of hope across much of the so called Third World. Six years ago  I returned to America and realized something  The American Dream was thriving  but only in India. In America  not so much. In fact  I observed that  America was fracturing into two distinct societies  a republic of dreams and a republic of fears. And then  I stumbled onto this  incredible tale of two lives and of these two Americas that brutally collided in that Dallas mini mart. I knew at once I wanted to learn more  and eventually that I would write a book about them  for their story was the story  of America's fracturing and of how it might be put back together. After he was shot  Raisuddin's life grew no easier. The day after admitting him  the hospital discharged him. His right eye couldn't see. He couldn't speak. Metal peppered his face. But he had no insurance   so they bounced him. His family in Bangladesh  begged him   Come home.  But he told them he had  a dream to see about. He found telemarketing work  then he became an Olive Garden waiter  because where better to get over his fear of white people than the Olive Garden  Now  as a devout Muslim  he refused alcohol  didn't touch the stuff. Then he learned that not selling it would slash his pay. So he reasoned  like a budding  American pragmatist   Well  God wouldn't want me to starve  would he   And before long  in some months   Raisuddin was that Olive Garden's highest grossing alcohol pusher. He found a man who taught him database administration. He got part time I.T. gigs. Eventually  he landed a six figure job at a blue chip tech company in Dallas. But as America began to work for Raisuddin  he avoided the classic error of the fortunate  assuming you're the rule   not the exception. In fact  he observed that many with the fortune of being born American were nonetheless trapped in lives that  made second chances like his impossible. He saw it at the Olive Garden itself  where so many of his colleagues had childhood horror stories of family dysfunction  chaos   addiction  crime. He'd heard a similar tale about the man who shot him back when he attended his trial. The closer Raisuddin got to the America he had coveted from afar  the more he realized there was another  equally real  America that was stingier with second chances. The man who shot Raisuddin grew up in that stingier America. From a distance  Mark Stroman was always the spark of parties  always making girls feel pretty. Always working  no matter what  drugs or fights he'd had the night before. But he'd always wrestled with demons. He entered the world through the three gateways that doom so many young American men  bad parents  bad schools  bad prisons. His mother told him  regretfully  as a boy that she'd been just    dollars  short of aborting him. Sometimes  that little boy  would be at school  he'd suddenly pull a knife  on his fellow classmates. Sometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents'  tenderly feeding horses. He was getting arrested before he shaved  first juvenile  then prison. He became a casual white supremacist and  like so many around him   a drug addled and absent father. And then  before long  he found himself on death row  for in his      counter jihad   he had shot not one mini mart clerk  but three. Only Raisuddin survived. Strangely  death row was  the first institution that left Stroman better. His old influences quit him. The people entering his life  were virtuous and caring  pastors  journalists  European pen pals. They listened to him  prayed with him  helped him question himself. And sent him on a journey  of introspection and betterment. He finally faced the hatred  that had defined his life. He read Viktor Frankl   the Holocaust survivor and regretted his swastika tattoos. He found God. Then one day in           years after his crimes  Stroman received news. One of the men he'd shot  the survivor  was fighting to save his life. You see  late in       eight years after that shooting  Raisuddin had gone on his own journey  a pilgrimage to Mecca. Amid its crowds   he felt immense gratitude  but also duty. He recalled promising God   as he lay dying in       that if he lived  he would serve  humanity all his days. Then  he'd gotten busy  relaying the bricks of a life. Now it was time to pay his debts. And he decided  upon reflection  that his method of payment would be an intervention  in the cycle of vengeance between the Muslim and Western worlds. And how would he intervene  By forgiving Stroman publicly in the name of Islam and its doctrine of mercy. And then suing the state of Texas and its governor Rick Perry to prevent them from executing Stroman  exactly like most people  shot in the face do. Yet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired  not only by faith. A newly minted American citizen  he had come to believe that Stroman was the product of a hurting America that couldn't just be lethally injected away. That insight is what moved me  to write my book  The True American.  This immigrant begging America  to be as merciful to a native son as it had been to an adopted one. In the mini mart  all those years earlier  not just two men   but two Americas collided. An America that still dreams   still strives  still imagines that tomorrow can build on today  and an America that has resigned to fate  buckled under stress and chaos  lowered expectations  an ducked into the oldest of refuges  the tribal fellowship of one's own narrow kind. And it was Raisuddin  despite being a newcomer  despite being attacked  despite being homeless and traumatized  who belonged to that republic of dreams and Stroman who belonged to that  other wounded country  despite being born with the privilege of a native white man. I realized these men's stories formed an urgent parable about America. The country I am so proud to call my own wasn't living through a  generalized decline as seen in Spain or Greece   where prospects were dimming for everyone. America is simultaneously the most and the least successful country in the industrialized world. Launching the world's best companies  even as record numbers  of children go hungry. Seeing life expectancy drop for large groups  even as it polishes  the world's best hospitals. America today is a sprightly young body  hit by one of those strokes  that sucks the life from one side  while leaving the other worryingly perfect. On July           right after  a sobbing Raisuddin testified in defense of Stroman's life  Stroman was killed by lethal injection by the state he so loved. Hours earlier  when Raisuddin still thought he could still save Stroman  the two men got to speak  for the second time ever. Here is an excerpt from their phone call. Raisuddin   Mark  you should know  that I am praying for God  the most compassionate and gracious. I forgive you and I do not hate you. I never hated you.  Stroman   You are a remarkable person. Thank you from my heart. I love you  bro.  Even more amazingly  after the execution  Raisuddin reached out to Stroman's  eldest daughter  Amber  an ex convinct and an addict. and offered his help.  You may have lost a father   he told her   but you've gained an uncle.  He wanted her  too  to have  a second chance. If human history were a parade  America's float would be  a neon shrine to second chances. But America  generous with second chances to the children of other lands  today grows miserly with first chances to the children of its own. America still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an American. But it is losing its luster at allowing every American to become a somebody. Over the last decade  seven million foreigners gained American citizenship. Remarkable. In the meanwhile  how many Americans gained a place in the middle class  Actually  the net influx was negative. Go back further   and it's even more striking  Since the   s  the middle class has shrunk by    percent  mainly because of the people tumbling out of it. And my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer than simple inequality. What I observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of American life. An affluent secession of up  up and away  into elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix of work  money and connections  and an impoverished secession  of down and out into disconnected  dead end lives that the fortunate scarcely see. And don't console yourself  that you are the    percent. If you live near a Whole Foods  if no one in your family serves  in the military  if you're paid by the year  not the hour  if most people you know finished college  if no one you know uses meth  if you married once and remain married  if you're not one of    million Americans with a criminal record    if any or all of these things  describe you  then accept the possibility that actually  you may not know what's going on and you may be part of the problem. Other generations had to build  a fresh society after slavery  pull through a depression  defeat fascism  freedom ride in Mississippi. The moral challenge of  my generation  I believe  is to reacquaint these two Americas  to choose union over secession once again. This ins't a problem we can tax or tax cut away. It won't be solved by tweeting harder  building slicker apps  or starting one more  artisanal coffee roasting service. It is a moral challenge that begs  each of us in the flourishing America to take on the wilting America as our own  as Raisuddin tried to do. Like him  we can make pilgrimages. And there  in Baltimore and Oregon  and Appalachia  find new purpose  as he did. We can immerse ourselves  in that other country  bear witness to its hopes and sorrows  and  like Raisuddin  ask what we can do. What can you do  What can you do  What can we do  How might we build  a more merciful country  We  the greatest inventors in the world  can invent solutions to the problems  of that America  not only our own. We  the writers and the journalists   can cover that America's stories  instead of shutting down  bureaus in its midst. We can finance that America's ideas  instead of ideas from New York  and San Francisco. We can put our stethoscopes to its backs  teach there  go to court there  make there  live there  pray there. This  I believe  is the calling  of a generation. An America whose two halves learn again to stride  to plow  to forge  to dare together. A republic of chances  rewoven  renewed  begins with us. Thank you. Tonight  I'm going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one  a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most  important moments in that person's life  and in yours. When I was    years old  I was lucky enough to find my calling when I fell into making radio stories. At almost the exact same time  I found out that my dad  who I was very  very close to  was gay. I was taken completely by surprise. We were a very tight knit family  and I was crushed. At some point  in one of our strained conversations  my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots. He told me that one night in       a group of young black and Latino drag queens fought back against the police at a gay bar in Manhattan called the Stonewall Inn  and how this sparked the modern gay rights movement. It was an amazing story  and it piqued my interest. So I decided to pick up my tape  recorder and find out more. With the help of a young archivist named Michael Shirker  we tracked down all of the people we could find who had been at the Stonewall Inn that night. Recording these interviews  I saw how the microphone gave me the license to go places I otherwise never would have gone and talk to people I might not otherwise ever have spoken to. I had the privilege of getting to know some of the most amazing  fierce and courageous human beings I had ever met. It was the first time the story of Stonewall had been told to a national audience. I dedicated the program to my dad  it changed my relationship with him  and it changed my life. Over the next    years  I made many more radio documentaries  working to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media. Over and over again  I'd see how this simple act of being interviewed could mean so much to people  particularly those who had been told that their stories didn't matter. I could literally see people's back straighten as they started to speak into the microphone. In       I made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels on the Bowery in Manhattan. Guys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades. They lived in cubicles the size of prison cells covered with chicken wire so you couldn't jump from one room into the next. Later  I wrote a book on the men with the photographer Harvey Wang. I remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book and showing one of the guys his page. He stood there staring at it in silence  then he grabbed the book out of my hand and started running down the long  narrow hallway holding it over his head shouting   I exist  I exist.  In many ways   I exist  became the clarion call for StoryCorps  this crazy idea that I had a dozen years ago. The thought was to take documentary work and turn it on its head. Traditionally  broadcast documentary has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people  but I wanted to try something where the interview itself was the purpose of this work  and see if we could give many  many  many people the chance to be listened to in this way. So in Grand Central Terminal    years ago  we built a booth where anyone  can come to honor someone else by interviewing them about their life. You come to this booth and you're met by a facilitator who brings you inside. You sit across from  say  your grandfather for close to an hour and you listen and you talk. Many people think of it as  if this was to be our last conversation  what would I want to ask of and say to this person who means so much to me  At the end of the session  you walk away with a copy of the interview and another copy goes to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress so that your great great great grandkids can someday get to know your grandfather through his voice and story. So we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world and invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation with another human being. I had no idea if it would work  but from the very beginning  it did. People treated the experience with incredible respect  and amazing conversations happened inside. I want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original Grand Central Booth. This is    year old Joshua Littman interviewing his mother  Sarah. Josh has Asperger's syndrome. As you may know  kids with Asperger's are incredibly smart but have a tough time socially. They usually have obsessions. In Josh's case  it's with animals  so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah at Grand Central nine years ago. do you think your life would be different without animals  Sarah Littman  I think it would be an eight without animals  because they add so much pleasure to life. JL  How else do you think your life would be different without them  SL  I could do without things like cockroaches and snakes. JL  Well  I'm okay with snakes as long as they're not venomous or constrict you or anything. SL  Yeah  I'm not a big snake person    JL  But cockroach is just the insect we love to hate. SL  Yeah  it really is. JL  Have you ever thought you couldn't cope with having a child  SL  I remember when you were a baby  you had really bad colic  so you would just cry and cry. JL  What's colic  SL  It's when you get this stomach ache and all you do is scream for  like  four hours. JL  Even louder than Amy does  SL  You were pretty loud  but Amy's was more high pitched. JL  I think it feels like everyone seems to like Amy more  like she's the perfect little angel. SL  Well  I can understand why you think that people like Amy more  and I'm not saying it's because of your Asperger's syndrome  but being friendly comes easily to Amy  whereas I think for you it's more difficult  but the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much. JL  Like Ben or Eric or Carlos  SL  Yeah    JL  Like I have better quality friends but less quantity   Laughter  SL  I wouldn't judge the quality  but I think    JL  I mean  first it was like  Amy loved Claudia  then she hated Claudia  she loved Claudia  then she hated Claudia. SL  Part of that's a girl thing  honey. The important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends  and really that's what you need in life. JL  Did I turn out to be the son you wanted when I was born  Did I meet your expectations  SL  You've exceeded my expectations  sweetie  because  sure  you have these fantasies of what your child's going to be like  but you have made me grow so much as a parent  because you think    JL  Well  I was the one who made you a parent. SL  You were the one who made me a parent. That's a good point.  Laughter  But also because you think differently from what they tell you in the parenting books  I really had to learn to think outside of the box with you  and it's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person  and I'll always thank you for that. JL  And that helped when Amy was born  SL  And that helped when Amy was born  but you are so incredibly special to me and I'm so lucky to have you as my son. David Isay  After this story ran on public radio  Josh received hundreds of letters telling him what an amazing kid he was. His mom  Sarah  bound them together in a book  and when Josh got picked on at school  they would read the letters together. I just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes are here with us tonight. Sarah Littman and her son Josh  who is now an honors student in college. You know  a lot of people talk about crying when they hear StoryCorps stories  and it's not because they're sad. Most of them aren't. I think it's because you're hearing something authentic and pure at this moment  when sometimes it's hard to tell what's real and what's an advertisement. It's kind of the anti reality TV. Nobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich. Nobody comes to get famous. It's simply an act of generosity and love. So many of these are just everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness  courage  decency and dignity  and when you hear that kind of story  it can sometimes feel like you're walking on holy ground. So this experiment  in Grand Central worked  and we expanded across the country. Today  more than         people in all    states in thousands of cities and towns across America have recorded StoryCorps interviews. It's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered. We've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience. Most serve a year or two with StoryCorps traveling the country  gathering the wisdom of humanity. They call it bearing witness  and if you ask them  all of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing they've learned from being present during these interviews is that people are basically good. And I think for the first years of StoryCorps  you could argue that there was some kind of a selection bias happening  but after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person in every part of the country    rich  poor  five years old to         different languages  across the political spectrum    you have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something. I've also learned so much from these interviews. I've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen  like this interview between a betting clerk in Brooklyn named Danny Perasa who brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps to talk about his love for her. I always feel guilty when I say  I love you  to you. And I say it so often. I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am  it's coming from me. It's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio  and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house. Annie Perasa  If I don't have a note on the kitchen table  I think there's something wrong. You write a love letter to me every morning. DP  Well  the only thing that could possibly be wrong is I couldn't find a silly pen. AP  To my princess  The weather outside today is extremely rainy. I'll call you at       in the morning. DP  It's a romantic weather report. AP  And I love you. I love you. I love you. DP  When a guy is happily married  no matter what happens at work  no matter what happens in the rest of the day  there's a shelter when you get home  there's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying   Get your hands off me.  Being married is like having a color television set. You never want to go back to black and white. DI  Danny was about five feet tall with crossed eyes and one single snaggletooth  but Danny Perasa had more romance in his little pinky than all of Hollywood's leading men put together. What else have I learned  I've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity for the human spirit to forgive. I've learned about resilience and I've learned about strength. Like an interview with Oshea Israel and Mary Johnson. When Oshea was a teenager  he murdered Mary's only son  Laramiun Byrd  in a gang fight. A dozen years later  Mary went to prison to meet Oshea and find out who this person was who had taken her son's life. Slowly and remarkably  they became friends  and when he was finally released from the penitentiary  Oshea actually moved in next door to Mary. This is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had soon after Oshea was freed. I didn't see him graduate  and now you're going to college. I'll have the opportunity to see you graduate. I didn't see him get married. Hopefully one day  I'll be able to experience that with you. Oshea Israel  Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation. It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path. You still believe in me  and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you  it's amazing. MJ  I know it's not an easy thing to be able to share our story together  even with us sitting here looking at each other right now. I know it's not an easy thing  so I admire that you can do this. OI  I love you  lady. MJ  I love you too  son. DI  And I've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people  and how the arc of history truly does bend towards justice. Like the story of Alexis Martinez  who was born Arthur Martinez in the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago. In the interview  she talks with her daughter Lesley about joining a gang as a young man  and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be. This is Alexis and her daughter Lesley. I was always afraid that I wouldn't be allowed to be in my granddaughters' lives  and you blew that completely out of the water  you and your husband. One of the fruits of that is  in my relationship with my granddaughters  they fight with each other sometimes over whether I'm he or she. Lesley Martinez  But they're free to talk about it. AM  They're free to talk about it  but that  to me  is a miracle. LM  You don't have to apologize. You don't have to tiptoe. We're not going to cut you off  and that's something I've always wanted you to just know  that you're loved. AM  You know  I live this every day now. I walk down the streets as a woman  and I really am at peace with who I am. I mean  I wish I had a softer voice maybe  but now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day. DI  Now I walk in love. I'm going to tell you a secret about StoryCorps. It takes some courage to have these conversations. StoryCorps speaks to our mortality. Participants know this recording will be heard long after they're gone. There's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock who has worked closely with us on recording interviews with people who are dying. He wrote a book called  The Four Things That Matter Most  about the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life before they or you die  thank you  I love you  forgive me  I forgive you. They're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another  and often that's what happens in a StoryCorps booth. It's a chance to have a sense of closure with someone you care about    no regrets  nothing left unsaid. And it's hard and it takes courage  but that's why we're alive  right  So  the TED Prize. When I first heard from TED and Chris a few months ago about the possibility of the Prize  I was completely floored. They asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity  no more than    words. So I thought about it  I wrote my    words  and a few weeks later  Chris called and said   Go for it.  So here is my wish  that you will help us take everything we've learned through StoryCorps and bring it to the world so that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history. How are we going to do that  With this. We're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world will have access to one of these  and it has powers I never could have imagined    years ago when I started StoryCorps. It has a microphone  it can tell you how to do things  and it can send audio files. Those are the key ingredients. So the first part of the wish is already underway. Over the past couple of months  the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths so that it can be experienced by anyone  anywhere  anytime. Remember  StoryCorps has always been two people and a facilitator helping them record their conversation  which is preserved forever  but at this very moment  we're releasing a public beta version of the StoryCorps app. The app is a digital facilitator that walks you through the StoryCorps interview process  helps you pick questions  and gives you all the tips you need to record a meaningful StoryCorps interview  and then with one tap upload it  to our archive at the Library of Congress. That's the easy part  the technology. The real challenge is up to you  to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across America and around the world  so that instead of recording thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year  we could potentially record tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even more. Imagine  for example  a national homework assignment where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving  so that in one single weekend an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured. Or imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world sitting down not to talk about that conflict but to find out who they are as people  and in doing so  begin to build bonds of trust  or that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world that people are honored with a StoryCorps interview on their   th birthday  or that people in your community go into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons armed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society and ask them who they are  what they've learned in life  and how they want to be remembered. Ten years ago  I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad who was a psychiatrist  and became a well known gay activist. This is the picture of us at that interview. I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago  when my dad  who seemed to be in perfect health and was still seeing patients    hours a week  was diagnosed with cancer. He passed away very suddenly a few days later. It was June           the anniversary of the Stonewall riots. I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died. I have a couple of young kids at home  and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session. I thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did  but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings. Every day  people come up to me and say   I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother  but I waited too long.  Now  no one has to wait anymore. At this moment  when so much of how we communicate is fleeting and inconsequential  join us in creating this digital archive of conversations that are enduring and important. Help us create this gift to our children  this testament to who we are as human beings. I hope you'll help us make this wish come true. Interview a family member  a friend or even a stranger. Together  we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity  and maybe in doing so  we'll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less. Maybe these conversations will remind us what's really important. And maybe  just maybe  it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life  every single life  matters equally and infinitely. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a potter  which seems like a fairly humble vocation. I know a lot about pots. I've spent about    years making them. One of the things that really excites me in my artistic practice and being trained as a potter is that you very quickly learn how to make great things out of nothing  that I spent a lot of time at my wheel with mounds of clay trying stuff  and that the limitations of my capacity  my ability  was based on my hands and my imagination  that if I wanted to make a really nice bowl and I didn't know how to make a foot yet  I would have to learn how to make a foot  that that process of learning has been very  very helpful to my life. I feel like  as a potter  you also start to learn how to shape the world. There have been times in my artistic capacity that I wanted to reflect on other really important moments in the history of the U.S.  the history of the world where tough things happened  but how do you talk about tough ideas without separating people from that content  Could I use art like these old  discontinued firehoses from Alabama  to talk about the complexities of a moment of civil rights in the '  s  Is it possible to talk about my father and I doing labor projects  My dad was a roofer  construction guy  he owned small businesses  and at     he was ready to retire and his tar kettle was my inheritance. Now  a tar kettle doesn't sound like much of an inheritance. It wasn't. It was stinky and it took up a lot of space in my studio  but I asked my dad if he would be willing to make some art with me  if we could reimagine this kind of nothing material as something very special. And by elevating the material and my dad's skill  could we start to think about tar just like clay  in a new way  shaping it differently  helping us to imagine what was possible  After clay  I was then kind of turned on to lots of different kinds of materials  and my studio grew a lot because I thought  well  it's not really about the material  it's about our capacity to shape things. I became more and more interested in ideas and more and more things that  were happening just outside my studio. Just to give you a little bit of context  I live in Chicago. I live on the South Side now. I'm a West Sider. For those of you who are not Chicagoans  that won't mean anything  but if I didn't mention that I was a West Sider  there would be a lot of people in the city that would be very upset. The neighborhood that I live in is Grand Crossing. It's a neighborhood that has seen better days. It is not a gated community by far. There is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood  and while I was kind of busy making pots and busy making art and having a good art career  there was all of this stuff that was happening just outside my studio. All of us know about failing housing markets and the challenges of blight  and I feel like we talk about it with some of our cities more than others  but I think a lot of our U.S. cities and beyond have the challenge of blight  abandoned buildings that people no longer know what to do anything with. And so I thought  is there a way that I could start to think about these buildings as an extension or an expansion of my artistic practice  And that if I was thinking along with other creatives    architects  engineers  real estate finance people    that us together might be able to kind of think in more complicated ways about the reshaping of cities. And so I bought a building. The building was really affordable. We tricked it out. We made it as beautiful as we could to try to just get some activity happening on my block. Once I bought the building for about        dollars  I didn't have any money left. So I started sweeping the building as a kind of performance. This is performance art  and people would come over  and I would start sweeping. Because the broom was free and sweeping was free. It worked out. But we would use the building  then  to stage exhibitions  small dinners  and we found that that building on my block  Dorchester    we now referred to the block as Dorchester projects    that in a way that building became a kind of gathering site for lots of different kinds of activity. We turned the building into what we called now the Archive House. The Archive House would do all of these amazing things. Very significant people in the city and beyond would find themselves in the middle of the hood. And that's when I felt like maybe there was a relationship between my history with clay and this new thing that was starting to develop  that we were slowly starting to reshape how people imagined the South Side of the city. One house turned into a few houses  and we always tried to suggest that not only is creating a beautiful vessel important  but the contents of what happens in those buildings is also very important. So we were not only thinking about development  but we were thinking about the program  thinking about the kind of connections that could happen between one house and another  between one neighbor and another. This building became what we call the Listening House  and it has a collection of discarded books from the Johnson Publishing Corporation  and other books from an old bookstore that was going out of business. I was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as I could with whatever and whoever would join me. In Chicago  there's amazing building stock. This building  which had been the former crack house on the block  and when the building became abandoned  it became a great opportunity to really imagine what else could happen there. So this space we converted into what we call Black Cinema House. Black Cinema House was an opportunity in the hood to screen films that were important and relevant to the folk who lived around me  that if we wanted to show an old Melvin Van Peebles film  we could. If we wanted to show  Car Wash   we could. That would be awesome. The building we soon outgrew  and we had to move to a larger space. Black Cinema House  which was made from just a small piece of clay  had to grow into a much larger piece of clay  which is now my studio. What I realized was that for those of you who are zoning junkies  that some of the things that I was doing in these buildings that had been left behind  they were not the uses by which the buildings were built  and that there are city policies that say   Hey  a house that is residential needs to stay residential.  But what do you do in neighborhoods when ain't nobody interested in living there  That the people who have the means to leave have already left  What do we do with these abandoned buildings  And so I was trying to wake them up using culture. We found that that was so exciting for folk  and people were so responsive to the work  that we had to then find bigger buildings. By the time we found bigger buildings  there was  in part  the resources  necessary to think about those things. In this bank that we called the Arts Bank  it was in pretty bad shape. There was about six feet of standing water. It was a difficult project to finance  because banks weren't interested in the neighborhood because people weren't interested in the neighborhood because nothing had happened there. It was dirt. It was nothing. It was nowhere. And so we just started imagining  what else could happen in this building  And so now that the rumor of my block has spread  and lots of people are starting to visit  we've found that the bank can now be a center for exhibition  archives  music performance  and that there are people who are now interested in being adjacent to those buildings because we brought some heat  that we kind of made a fire. One of the archives that we'll have there is this Johnson Publishing Corporation. We've also started to collect memorabilia from American history  from people who live or have lived in that neighborhood. Some of these images are degraded images of black people  kind of histories of very challenging content  and where better than a neighborhood with young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity to talk about some of the complexities of race and class  In some ways  the bank represents a hub  that we're trying to create a pretty  hardcore node of cultural activity  and that if we could start to make multiple hubs and connect some cool green stuff around there  that the buildings that we've purchased and rehabbed  which is now around    or    units  that if we could land miniature Versailles on top of that  and connect these buildings by a beautiful greenbelt    that this place where people never wanted to be would become an important destination for folk from all over the country and world. In some ways  it feels very much like I'm a potter  that we tackle the things that are at our wheel  we try with the skill that we have to think about this next bowl that I want to make. And it went from a bowl to a singular house to a block to a neighborhood to a cultural district to thinking about the city  and at every point  there were things that I didn't know that I had to learn. I've never learned so much about zoning law in my life. I never thought I'd have to. But as a result of that  I'm finding that there's not just room for my own artistic practice  there's room for a lot of other artistic practices. So people started asking us   Well  Theaster  how are you going to go to scale   and   What's your sustainability plan   And what I found was that I couldn't export myself  that what seems necessary in cities like Akron  Ohio  and Detroit  Michigan  and Gary  Indiana  is that there are people in those places who already believe in those places  that are already dying to make those places beautiful  and that often  those people who are passionate about a place are disconnected from the resources necessary to make cool things happen  or disconnected from a contingency of people that could help make things happen. So now  we're starting to give advice around the country on how to start with what you got  how to start with the things that are in front of you  how to make something out of nothing  how to reshape your world at a wheel or at your block or at the scale of the city. Thank you so much. June Cohen  Thank you. So I think many people watching this will be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end  How can they do this in their own city  You can't export yourself. Give us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired about their city can do to take on projects like yours  Theaster Gates  One of the things I've found that's really important is giving thought to not just the kind of individual project  like an old house  but what's the relationship between an old house  a local school  a small bodega  and is there some kind of synergy between those things  Can you get those folk talking  I've found that in cases where neighborhoods have failed  they still often have a pulse. How do you identify the pulse in that place  the passionate people  and then how do you get folk who have been fighting  slogging for    years  reenergized about the place that they live  And so someone has to do that work. If I were a traditional developer  I would be talking about buildings alone  and then putting a  For Lease  sign in the window. I think that you actually have to curate more than that  that there's a way in which you have to be mindful about  what are the businesses that I want to grow here  And then  are there people who live in this place who want to grow those businesses with me  Because I think it's not just a cultural space or housing  there has to be the recreation of an economic core. So thinking about those things together feels right. JC  It's hard to get people to create the spark again when people have been slogging for    years. Are there any methods you've found that have helped break through  TG  Yeah  I think that now there are lots of examples of folk who are doing amazing work  but those methods are sometimes like  when the media is constantly saying that only violent things happen in a place  then based on your skill set and the particular context  what are the things that you can do in your neighborhood to kind of fight some of that  So I've found that if you're a theater person  you have outdoor street theater festivals. In some cases  we don't have the resources in certain neighborhoods to do things that are a certain kind of splashy  but if we can then find ways of making sure that people who are local to a place  plus people who could be supportive of the things that are happening locally  when those people get together  I think really amazing things can happen. JC  So interesting. And how can you make sure that the projects you're creating are actually for the disadvantaged and not just for the sort of vegetarian indie movie crowd that might move in to take advantage of them. TG  Right on. So I think this is where it starts to get into the thick weeds. JC  Let's go there. TG  Right now  Grand Crossing is    percent black  or at least living  and we know that maybe who owns property in a place is different from who walks the streets every day. So it's reasonable to say that Grand Crossing is already in the process of being something different than it is today. But are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts or a mission based development that starts to protect some of the space that happens  because when you have       empty lots in a city  you want something to happen there  but you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece  but entities that are interested in the stabilization piece  and I feel like often the developer piece is really motivated  but the other work of a kind of neighborhood consciousness  that part doesn't live anymore. So how do you start to grow up important watchdogs that ensure that the resources that are made available to new folk that are coming in are also distributed to folk who have lived in a place for a long time. JC  That makes so much sense. One more question  You make such a compelling case for beauty and the importance of beauty and the arts. There would be others who would argue that funds would be better spent on basic services for the disadvantaged. How do you combat that viewpoint  or come against it  TG  I believe that beauty  is a basic service. Often what I have found is that when there are resources that have not been made available to certain under resourced cities or neighborhoods or communities  that sometimes culture is the thing that helps to ignite  and that I can't do everything  but I think that there's a way in which if you can start with culture and get people kind of reinvested in their place  other kinds of adjacent amenities start to grow  and then people can make a demand that's a poetic demand  and the political demands that are necessary to wake up our cities  they also become very poetic. JC  It makes perfect sense to me. Theaster  thank you so much for being here with us today. Thank you. Theaster Gates. When I wrote my memoir  the publishers were really confused. Was it about me as a child refugee  or as a woman who set up a high tech software company back in the     s  one that went public and eventually employed over       people  Or was it as a mother of an autistic child  Or as a philanthropist that's now given away serious money  Well  it turns out  I'm all of these. So let me tell you my story. All that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna  part of the Kindertransport that saved nearly        Jewish children from Nazi Europe. I was five years old  clutching the hand of my nine year old sister and had very little idea as to  what was going on.  What is England and  why am I going there   I'm only alive because so long ago   I was helped by generous strangers. I was lucky  and doubly lucky to be later reunited with my birth parents. But  sadly  I never bonded  with them again. But I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than I would ever have dreamed possible. And I love England  my adopted country  with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel. I decided to make mine a life that was worth saving. And then  I just got on with it. Let me take you back to the early     s. To get past the gender issues of the time  I set up my own software house at one of the first such startups in Britain. But it was also a company of women  a company for women  an early social business. And people laughed at the very idea because software  at that time  was given away free with hardware. Nobody would buy software  certainly not from a woman. Although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees  there was a glass ceiling to our progress. And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often  and I wanted opportunities for women. I recruited professionally qualified women who'd left the industry on marriage  or when their first child was expected and structured them into a home working organization. We pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce after a career break. We pioneered all sorts of new  flexible work methods  job shares  profit sharing   and eventually  co ownership when I took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me. For years  I was the first woman this  or the only woman that. And in those days  I couldn't work on the stock exchange  I couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane. Indeed  I couldn't open a bank account without my husband's permission. My generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay. Nobody really expected much  from people at work or in society because all the expectations then were about home and  family responsibilities. And I couldn't really face that  so I started to challenge the conventions of the time  even to the extent of changing my name from  Stephanie  to  Steve  in my business development letters  so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she. My company  called Freelance Programmers  and that's precisely what it was  couldn't have started smaller   on the dining room table  and financed by the equivalent of     dollars in today's terms  and financed by my labor and  by borrowing against the house. My interests were scientific   the market was commercial    things such as payroll  which I found rather boring. So I had to compromise with  operational research work  which had the intellectual challenge  that interested me and the commercial value  that was valued by the clients  things like scheduling freight trains  time tabling buses  stock control  lots and lots of stock control. And eventually  the work came in. We disguised the domestic and part time nature of the staff by offering fixed prices  one of the very first to do so. And who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder  of Supersonic Concord would have been done by a bunch  of women working in their own homes. All we used was a simple   trust the staff  approach and a simple telephone. We even used to ask job applicants    Do you have access to a telephone   An early project was to develop software standards on management control protocols. And software was and still is a maddeningly hard to control activity  so that was enormously valuable. We used the standards ourselves  we were even paid to update  them over the years  and eventually  they were adopted by NATO. Our programmers    remember  only women  including gay and transgender    worked with pencil and paper to develop flowcharts defining each task to be done. And they then wrote code   usually machine code  sometimes binary code  which was then sent by mail to a data center to be punched onto paper tape or card and then re punched   in order to verify it. All this  before it ever got near a computer. That was programming in the early     s. In          years from startup  equal opportunity legislation  came in in Britain and that made it illegal to have  our pro female policies. And as an example of  unintended consequences  my female company had to let the men in. When I started my company of women  the men said   How interesting  because it only works because it's small.  And later  as it became sizable   they accepted   Yes  it is sizable now  but of no strategic interest.  And later  when it was a company valued at over three billion dollars  and I'd made    of the staff  into millionaires  they sort of said   Well done  Steve   You can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads  They're flat on top for being  patted patronizingly. And we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink. Let me share with you  two secrets of success  Surround yourself with first class people and people that you like  and choose your partner very  very carefully. Because the other day when I said    My husband's an angel   a woman complained     You're lucky   she said   mine's still alive.  If success were easy   we'd all be millionaires. But in my case  it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed  crisis. Our late son  Giles  was an only child  a beautiful  contented baby. And then  at two and a half  like a changeling in a fairy story  he lost the little speech that he had and turned into a wild   unmanageable toddler. Not the terrible twos  he was profoundly autistic  and he never spoke again. Giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that I set up to pioneer services for autism. And then there's been a groundbreaking Prior's Court school for pupils with autism and a medical research charity  again  all for autism. Because whenever I found a gap in services  I tried to help. I like doing new things  and making new things happen. And I've just started a three year  think tank for autism. And so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems  I've also founded  the Oxford Internet Institute and other IT ventures. The Oxford Internet Institute focuses not on the technology  but on the social  economic  legal and ethical issues of the Internet. Giles died unexpectedly    years ago now. And I have learned to live without him  and I have learned to live  without his need of me. Philanthropy is all that I do now. I need never worry about getting lost because several charities would quickly come and find me. It's one thing to have an idea  for an enterprise  but as many people in this room will know  making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy  self belief and determination  the courage to risk family and home  and a      commitment  that borders on the obsessive. So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic. I believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility. Work is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else. We live our lives forward. So what has all that taught me  I learned that tomorrow's  never going to be like today  and certainly nothing like yesterday. And that made me able to cope with change  indeed  eventually to welcome change  though I'm told I'm still very difficult. Thank you very much. I'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture. A hundred years ago  we tended to die of infectious diseases like pneumonia  that  if they took hold  would take us away quite quickly. We tended to die at home  in our own beds  looked after by family  although that was the default option because a lot of people lacked access to medical care. And then in the   th century a lot of things changed. We developed new medicines like penicillin so we could treat those infectious diseases. New medical technologies like x ray machines were invented. And because they were so big and expensive  we needed large  centralized buildings to keep them in  and they became our modern hospitals. After the Second World War  a lot of countries set up  universal healthcare systems so that everyone who needed treatment could get it. The result was that lifespans extended from about    at the start of the century to almost double that today. The   th century was this time of huge  optimism about what science could offer  but with all of the focus on life  death was forgotten  even as our approach to death changed dramatically. Now  I'm an architect  and for the past year and a half I've been looking at these changes and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying. We now tend to die of cancer and heart disease  and what that means is that many of us will have a long period of chronic illness at the end of our lives. During that period  we'll likely spend a lot of time  in hospitals and hospices and care homes. Now  we've all been in a modern hospital. You know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs. Hospital architecture has earned its bad reputation. But the surprising thing is  it wasn't always like this. This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti  built in      by Brunelleschi  who was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time. And when I look at this building and then think about hospitals today  what amazes me is this building's ambition. It's just a really great building. It has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air  and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings  so they just feel more comfortable to be in. And it's also beautiful. Somehow  we've forgotten that that's even possible for a hospital. Now  if we want better buildings for dying  then we have to talk about it  but because we find the subject of death uncomfortable  we don't talk about it  and we don't question how we as a society approach death. One of the things that surprised me most in my research  though  is how changeable attitudes actually are. This is the first crematorium in the U.K.  which was built in Woking in the     s. And when this was first built  there were protests in the local village. Cremation wasn't socially acceptable  and   .  percent of people got buried. And yet  only a hundred years later  three quarters of us get cremated. People are actually really open to changing things if they're given the chance to talk about them. So this conversation about death and architecture was what I wanted to start when I did my first exhibition on it in Venice in June  which was called  Death in Venice.  It was designed to be quite playful so that people would literally engage with it. This is one of our exhibits  which is an interactive map of London that shows just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death and dying  and as you wave your hand across the map  the name of that piece of real estate  the building or cemetery  is revealed. Another of our exhibits was a series of postcards that people could take away with them. And they showed people's homes and hospitals and cemeteries and mortuaries  and they tell the story of the different spaces that we pass through on either side of death. We wanted to show that where we die is a key part of how we die. Now  the strangest thing was the way that visitors reacted to the exhibition  especially the audio visual works. We had people dancing and running and jumping as they tried to activate the exhibits in different ways  and at a certain point they would kind of stop and remember that they were in an exhibition about death  and that maybe that's not how you're supposed to act. But actually  I would question whether there is one way that you're supposed to act around death  and if there's not  I'd ask you to think about what you think a good death is  and what you think that architecture that supports a good death might be like  and mightn't it be a little less like this and a little more like this  Thank you. I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma  retinal cancer. My right eye was removed at seven months of age. I was    months when they removed my left eye. The first thing I did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care nursery  probably looking for the one who did this to me. Evidently  wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes. The problem was getting caught. It's impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself. Think for a moment about your own impressions of blindness. Think about your reactions when I first came onto the stage  or the prospect of your own blindness  or a loved one going blind. The terror is incomprehensible to most of us  because blindness is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness  hapless exposure to the ravages of the dark unknown. How poetic. Fortunately for me  my parents were not poetic. They were pragmatic. They understood that ignorance and fear were but matters of the mind  and the mind is adaptable. They believed that I should grow up to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else. In their own words  I would move out    which I did when I was       I will pay taxes    thanks     Laughter     and they knew the difference between love and fear. Fear immobilizes us in the face of challenge. They knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge. I was not raised with fear. They put my freedom first before all else  because that is what love does. Now  moving forward  how do I manage today  The world is a much larger nursery. Fortunately  I have my trusty long cane  longer than the canes used by most blind people. I call it my freedom staff. It will keep me  for example  from making an undignified  departure from the stage.  Laughter  I do see that cliff edge. They warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage. I don't care to set a new precedent. But beyond that  many of you may have heard me clicking as I came onto the stage    with my tongue. Those are flashes of sound that go out and reflect from surfaces all around me  just like a bat's sonar  and return to me with patterns   with pieces of information  much as light does for you. And my brain  thanks to my parents  has been activated to form images in my visual cortex  which we now call the imaging system  from those patterns of information  much as your brain does. I call this process flash sonar. It is how I have learned to see through my blindness  to navigate my journey through the dark unknowns of my own challenges  which has earned me the moniker  the remarkable Batman.  Now  Batman I will accept. Bats are cool. Batman is cool. But I was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable. I have always regarded myself much like anyone else who navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges. Is that so remarkable  I do not use my eyes  I use my brain. Now  someone  somewhere  must think that's remarkable  or I wouldn't be up here  but let's consider this for a moment. Everyone out there who faces or who has ever faced a challenge  raise your hands. Whoosh. Okay. Lots of hands going up  a moment  let me do a head count. This will take a while.  Clicking   Laughter  Okay  lots of hands in the air. Keep them up. I have an idea. Those of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges  put your hands down. Okay  anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own.  Laughter  So we all face challenges  and we all face the dark unknown  which is endemic to most challenges  which is what most of us fear  okay  But we all have brains that allow us  that activate to allow us to navigate the journey through these challenges. Okay  Case in point  I came up here and     Clicking     they wouldn't tell me where the lectern was. So you can't trust those TED folks.  Find it yourself   they said. So     Laughter  And the feedback for the P.A. system is no help at all. So now I present to you a challenge. So if you'd all close your eyes for just a moment  okay  And you're going to learn a bit of flash sonar. I'm going to make a sound. I'm going to hold this panel in front  of me  but I'm not going to move it. Just listen to the sound for a moment. Shhhhhhhhhh. Okay  nothing very interesting. Now  listen to what happens to that same exact sound when I move the panel. Shhhhhhhhhhh.   Pitch getting higher and lower  You do not know the power of the dark side. I couldn't resist. Okay  now keep your eyes closed because  did you hear the difference  Okay. Now  let's be sure. For your challenge  you tell me  just say  now  when you hear the panel start to move. Okay  We'll relax into this. Shhhhhhh. Audience  Now. Daniel Kish  Good. Excellent. Open your eyes. All right. So just a few centimeters  you would notice the difference. You've experienced sonar. You'd all make great blind people.  Laughter  Let's have a look at what can happen when this activation process is given some time and attention. and we can see with our ears. Brian Bushway  It's not a matter of enjoying it more or less  it's about enjoying it differently. Shawn Marsolais  It goes across. DK  Yeah. SM  And then it's gradually coming back down again. DK  Yes  SM  That's amazing. I can  like  see the car. Holy mother  J. Louchart  I love being blind. If I had the opportunity  honestly  I wouldn't go back to being sighted. JR  The bigger the goal  the more obstacles you'll face  and on the other side of that goal is victory.  In Italian  DK  Now  do these people look terrified  Not so much. We have delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly    countries. When blind people learn to see  sighted people seem inspired to want to learn to see their way better  more clearly  with less fear  because this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all to navigate any type of challenge  through any form of darkness  to discoveries unimagined when we are activated. I wish you all a most activating journey. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Daniel  my friend. As I know you can see  it's a spectacular standing ovation at TED. Thank you for an extraordinary talk. Just one more question about your world  your inner world that you construct. We think that we have things in our world that you as a blind person don't have  but what's your world like  What do you have that we don't have  DK  Three hundred and sixty degree view  so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me. It works around corners. It works through surfaces. Generally  it's kind of a fuzzy three dimensional geometry. One of my students  who has now become an instructor  when he lost his vision  after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house  conversations  people in the kitchen  people in the bathroom  several floors away  several walls away. He said it was something like having x ray vision. CA  What do you picture that you're in right now  How do you picture this theater  DK  Lots of loudspeakers  quite frankly. It's interesting.  When people make a sound  when they laugh  when they fidget  when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever  I hear everything. I hear every little movement that every single person makes. None of it really escapes my attention  and then  from a sonar perspective  the size of the room  the curvature  of the audience around the stage  it's the height of the room. Like I say  it's all that kind  of three dimensional surface geometry all around me. CA  Well  Daniel  you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way. Thanks so much for that  truly. DK  Thank you.
