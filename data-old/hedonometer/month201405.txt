We live in a very complex environment  complexity and dynamism and patterns of evidence from satellite photographs  from videos. You can even see it outside your window. It's endlessly complex  but somehow familiar  but the patterns kind of repeat  but they never repeat exactly. It's a huge challenge to understand. The patterns that you see are there at all of the different scales  but you can't chop it into one little bit and say   Oh  well let me just make a smaller climate.  I can't use the normal products of reductionism to get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study in a laboratory and say   Oh  now that's something I now understand.  It's the whole or it's nothing. The different scales that give you these kinds of patterns range over an enormous range of magnitude  roughly    orders of magnitude  from the small microscopic particles that seed clouds to the size of the planet itself  from    to the minus six to    to the eight     orders of spatial magnitude. In time  from milliseconds to millennia  again around    orders of magnitude. What does that mean  Okay  well if you think about how you can calculate these things  you can take what you can see  okay  I'm going to chop it up into lots of little boxes  and that's the result of physics  right  And if I think about a weather model  that spans about five orders of magnitude  from the planet to a few kilometers  and the time scale from a few minutes to    days  maybe a month. We're interested in more than that. We're interested in the climate. That's years  that's millennia  and we need to go to even smaller scales. The stuff that we can't resolve  the sub scale processes  we need to approximate in some way. That is a huge challenge. Climate models in the     s took an even smaller chunk of that  only about three orders of magnitude. Climate models in the     s  kind of what we're working with now  four orders of magnitude. We have    to go  and we're increasing our capability of simulating those at about one extra order of magnitude every decade. One extra order of magnitude in space is        times more calculations. And we keep adding more things  more questions to these different models. So what does a climate model look like  This is an old climate model  admittedly  a punch card  a single line of Fortran code. We no longer use punch cards. We do still use Fortran. New fangled ideas like C really haven't had a big impact on the climate modeling community. But how do we go about doing it  How do we go from that complexity that you saw to a line of code  We do it one piece at a time. This is a picture of sea ice taken flying over the Arctic. We can look at all of the different equations that go into making the ice grow or melt or change shape. We can look at the fluxes. We can look at the rate at which snow turns to ice  and we can code that. We can encapsulate that in code. These models are around a million lines of code at this point  and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code every year. So you can look at that piece  but you can look at the other pieces too. What happens when you have clouds  What happens when clouds form  when they dissipate  when they rain out  That's another piece. What happens when we have radiation coming from the sun  going through the atmosphere  being absorbed and reflected  We can code each of those very small pieces as well. There are other pieces  the winds changing the ocean currents. We can talk about the role of vegetation in transporting water from the soils back into the atmosphere. And each of these different elements we can encapsulate and put into a system. Each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole. And you get something like this. You get a beautiful representation of what's going on in the climate system  where each and every one of those emergent patterns that you can see  the swirls in the Southern Ocean  the tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico  and there's two more that are going to pop up in the Pacific at any point now  those rivers of atmospheric water  all of those are emergent properties that come from the interactions of all of those small scale processes I mentioned. There's no code that says   Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean.  There's no code that says   Have two tropical cyclones that spin around each other.  All of those things are emergent properties. This is all very good. This is all great. But what we really want to know is what happens to these emergent properties when we kick the system  When something changes  what happens to those properties  And there's lots of different ways to kick the system. There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit over hundreds of thousands of years that change the climate. There are changes in the solar cycles  every    years and longer  that change the climate. Big volcanoes go off and change the climate. Changes in biomass burning  in smoke  in aerosol particles  all of those things change the climate. The ozone hole changed the climate. Deforestation changes the climate by changing the surface properties and how water is evaporated and moved around in the system. Contrails change the climate by creating clouds where there were none before  and of course greenhouse gases change the system. Each of these different kicks provides us with a target to evaluate whether we understand something about this system. So we can go to look at what model skill is. Now I use the word  skill  advisedly  Models are not right or wrong  they're always wrong. They're always approximations. The question you have to ask is whether a model tells you more information than you would have had otherwise. If it does  it's skillful. This is the impact of the ozone hole on sea level pressure  so low pressure  high pressures  around the southern oceans  around Antarctica. This is observed data. This is modeled data. There's a good match because we understand the physics that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere and what that does to the winds around the southern oceans. We can look at other examples. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in      put an enormous amount of aerosols  small particles  into the stratosphere. That changed the radiation balance of the whole planet. There was less energy coming in than there was before  so that cooled the planet  and those red lines and those green lines  those are the differences between what we expected and what actually happened. The models are skillful  not just in the global mean  but also in the regional patterns. I could go through a dozen more examples  the skill associated with solar cycles  changing the ozone in the stratosphere  the skill associated with orbital changes over       years. We can look at that too  and the models are skillful. The models are skillful in response to the ice sheets        years ago. The models are skillful when it comes to the   th century trends over the decades. Models are successful at modeling lake outbursts into the North Atlantic       years ago. And we can get a good match to the data. Each of these different targets  each of these different evaluations  leads us to add more scope to these models  and leads us to more and more complex situations that we can ask more and more interesting questions  like  how does dust from the Sahara  that you can see in the orange  interact with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic  How do organic aerosols from biomass burning  which you can see in the red dots  intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns  How does pollution  which you can see in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe  how does that affect the temperatures at the surface and the sunlight that you get at the surface  We can look at this across the world. We can look at the pollution from China. We can look at the impacts of storms on sea salt particles in the atmosphere. We can see the combination of all of these different things happening all at once  and we can ask much more interesting questions. How do air pollution and climate coexist  Can we change things that affect air pollution and climate at the same time  The answer is yes. So this is a history of the   th century. The first one is the model. The weather is a little bit different to what actually happened. The second one are the observations. And we're going through the     s. There's variability  there are things going on  but it's all kind of in the noise. As you get towards the     s  things are going to start to change. They're going to start to look more similar  and by the time you get to the     s  you're already seeing the patterns of global warming  both in the observations and in the model. We know what happened over the   th century. Right  We know that it's gotten warmer. We know where it's gotten warmer. And if you ask the models why did that happen  and you say  okay  well  yes  basically it's because of the carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere. We have a very good match up until the present day. But there's one key reason why we look at models  and that's because of this phrase here. Because if we had observations of the future  we obviously would trust them more than models  But unfortunately  observations of the future are not available at this time. So when we go out into the future  there's a difference. The future is unknown  the future is uncertain  and there are choices. Here are the choices that we have. We can do some work to mitigate the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That's the top one. We can do more work to really bring it down so that by the end of the century  it's not much more than there is now. Or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business as usual type of attitude. The differences between these choices can't be answered by looking at models. There's a great phrase that Sherwood Rowland  who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry that led to ozone depletion  when he was accepting his Nobel Prize  he asked this question   What is the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions if  in the end  all we're willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true   The models are skillful  but what we do with the information from those models is totally up to you. Thank you. First of all  for those of you who are not familiar with my work  I create multicultural characters  so characters from lots of different backgrounds. So before the present is the new future  a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family that was multi everything    multi racial  multi cultural  black and white  Caribbean  Irish American  German American. There was Dominican music blasting from stereos. There were Christians and Jews. That's a long story filled with intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame. But I was totally immersed in this world that was filled with everybody  and then I went on to the United Nations school  and that just completely   So I began sort of developing these voices and these people  all of whom were loosely based on people I really know  and so  for example  in performing them  I would really try to inhabit them. And for example  I don't really talk like that  but that was one of my people  and I'm going to bring a few of my friends    I think of them as my friends   to this stage  in this spirit of the idea that the present is the new future  in sort of a meta way  because I thought about it  and the future  for me  what can be so frightening is that I don't know what's coming. I don't know if that's true for other people  but that notion of thinking about how we can understand the future and predict outcomes  for me  it's terrifying to not know what might be coming. And so the idea that there are questions that I've never seen that my people are going to answer  and some of these characters have been with me for ages  some of them don't even have names  I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's coming  and all I can do is remind myself that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants  and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like that dream where you don't have any pants on  and so I suppose I'm going to be flying by the seat of my ass. That said  let's just see who comes out. May we have the first question   Do you ever get headaches from the microchips implanted in your brain   Right. Okay. Well first of all  I'll just say that I hope you can hear me okay. My name is Lorraine Levine  and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain  frankly  just putting on my glasses reminds me of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses. No offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them  but at my age  just putting on the regular ones I have already gives me too much information. Do you understand what I'm saying to you  I don't need to know more. I don't want to know. That's it. That's enough. I love you all. You're wonderful. It's fabulous to be here with such big machers again this year. Mwah  Okay  next question.  Applause  Next  please.  Is dating boring  now that humans reproduce asexually   Who do we got  Hi  um  okay  hi everybody. My name is Nereida. I just want to say first of all that dating is never boring under any circumstance. But I am very excited to be here right now  so I am just trying to remind myself that  you know  like  the purpose of being here and everything  I mean  trying to answer these questions  it is very exciting. But I also  I just need to acknowledge that TED is an incredible experience right now in the present  like  I just need to say  like  Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende  Okay  maybe it doesn't mean  of course it means something to you  but to me  it's like  another level  okay  Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact that there are role models here that I can really  I don't know  I just need to say that. That's incredible to me  and sometimes when I'm nervous and everything like that  I just need to  like  say some affirmations that can help me. I usually just try to use  like  the three little words that always make me feel better  Sotomayor  Sotomayor  Sotomayor.  Laughter  Just  it really helps me to get grounded. Now I can use Allende  Allende  Allende  and  you know  I just need to say it  like  it's so incredible to be here  and I knew that we were going to have these questions. I was so nervous and I was thinking just  like  oh my God  oh my God  and reminding me  because I've had  like  some very  especially since the last time we were here at TED  it was  like  unbelievable  and then right after that  like  so many crazy things happened  like  we ended up going to the White House to perform. That was  like  amazing  and I'm standing there  and I was just like  please don't say   Oh my God.  Don't say   Oh my God.  And I just kept saying it   Oh my God. Oh my God.  And  you know  I kept thinking to myself  like  President Obama has to come up here at the same podium  and I'm standing here saying   Oh my God.  It's like  the separation of church and state. It's just  I couldn't  like  I couldn't process. It was really too much. So I think I've lost my way. But what I wanted to say is that dating  for me  you know  as far as I'm concerned  however you reproduce  as long as you're enjoying yourself and it's with another consenting asexual    I don't know. You know where I'm going with that. Okay  ciao  gracias. Okay  next question.  Applause  What are your top five favorite songs right now  All right  well first of all  I'mma say  you know what I'm saying  I'm the only dude up here right now. My name is Rashid  and I never been at TED before  you know what I'm saying. I think  Sarah Jones  maybe she didn't want me to come out last time. I don't know why. You know what I'm saying. Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED. You know what I'm saying. First of all  that I'm in hip hop  you know what I'm saying. I know some of y'all may be not really as much into the music  but the first way y'all can always know  you know what I'm saying  that I'm in hip hop  is 'cos I hold the microphone in an official emcee posture. Y'all can see that right there. That's how you hold it. All right  so you get your little tutorial right there. But when Sarah Jones told me we was gonna come up here  I was like  betch  you know what I'm saying  TED is real fly  I got a whole lot of dope  you know what I'm saying  shit going on and everything  but she was like  yeah  we're going to have to answer  like  some random questions  just like  and I was like  what the hell is that  You know what I'm saying  just stand up there and answer some random questions  I don't want to  I mean  it's like an intellectual stop and frisk. You know what I'm saying   Laughter  I don't want to be standing up there just all getting interrogated and whatnot. That's what I'm trying to leave behind in New York. You know what I'm saying  So anyway  I would have to say my top five songs right now is all out of my own personal catalogue  you know what I mean  So if you want to know more about that  you know what I'm saying  we could talk about the anti piracy and all that  but as far as I'm concerned  you know  I believe in creative commons  and I think it's really important that  you know  that needs to be sustainable and everything  and I mean  as far as I'm concerned  I mean  this right here  this environment  I would like to sustain. You know what I mean  But I'm just saying  if y'all are interested in the top five songs  you need to holler at me. You know what I'm saying  Aight  In the future or the present. Yeah. Enjoy the rest of it. Okay  next question. What do you got   How many of your organs have been  D printed   Well I have to say that I don't know about how many of my organs have been   D printed as such  but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me  kind of thinking about this concept of the future and that  you know  all around the world parents are kind of telling their small children  please  you have to eat that  you know  I have slaved over a hot  D printer all day so that you can have this meal. You know  that kind of thing. And of course now that we have changed  you know  from the global South  there is this total kind of perspective shift that is happening around the    You can't just say to them  well  there are starving children. Well  it is the future. Nobody is starving anymore  thank God. But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism  and I do hope that we can continue to kind of  D print  well  let us just say I like to think that even in the future we will have the publication  kind of  you know  all the food that's fit to print. But everybody  please do enjoy that  and again  I think that you do throw a cracking good party here at TED. Thank you. Next question.  Applause  What has changed  Okay  it's like  I have to think about that.  What has changed now that women run the world   First of all  I really  like  I just want to say  and my name is Bella  I just want to  like  identify myself  that  like  as a feminist  I  like  I really find that  like  because I was born in the '  s  and  like  there were a lot of women who were as far as feminism was concerned  like  maybe they didn't understand that  like  a feminist like me  like  I don't think it's required that you have to have a certain kind of voice  or  like  a certain way of presenting yourself to be feminist  because I think that  like  feminism can be really hot  and I think actually that it's really vital and important. Like  the quotation I'm wearing is from  like  Gloria Steinem  and  like  I'm named Bella for  like  Bella Abzug  who's  like  obviously  like  a really important feminist from  like  history  and like  I just think that those women  like  really represent  like  that you can  like  be vital and  like  amazing  like  a mazing  and you don't have to wear  like  an Eileen Fisher caftan  just to  like  prove that you are a feminist. Like  not that there's anything wrong with that  but my mom  she's like  like  why do you have to wear pants that  like  objectify your body  I like my pants. Like  I like my voice. Like  she's like  why do you have to talk like   Talk like what  Like  I'm expressing myself  and I think that we have to  like  reach out  like  not only across  like  the different generations of feminists  but also across the  like  vocal ranges  so that  like  we  because otherwise it's just  like  restriculous within feminism  which is just  like  a word that I created that means  like  so strict it's ridiculous. So that's my feeling about that. You guys are a mazing  by the way. Okay. Next question.   They've discovered a cure for cancer  but not baldness  What's up with that    Yeah  you know what  so my name is Joseph Mancuso. First of all  I just want to say that I appreciate that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd  a pretty orderly group. And  you know  I just have to say  the whole thing with baldness  and  you know  here's the thing. As long as the woman  in my case    because it's a modern world  do whatever you want to do  I don't have any problem with anybody  enjoy yourself  LGBTQLMNOP. All right  But as far as I'm concerned  attractiveness  women don't really care as much as you think they do about the  you know. I mean  I remember hearing this woman. She loved her husband  it was the sweetest thing. It's a pretty young girl  you know  And this guy's older. And  you know  she said she would love him even if he had snow on the roof or even if melted and disappeared altogether. As far as I'm concerned  it's about the love. Am I right  or am I right  So that's it. That's it. That's it. I don't got nothing more to say. Keep your noses clean. All right  next question.  Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown   Um  well  I  I want to start by saying that this is a very difficult experience for a Chinese American. I don't know what to call myself now  because I have really my Chinese identity  but my kids  they are American Chinese  but it's difficult to try to express myself in front of audience of people like this. But if had to give my opinion about meat  I think first  the most important thing is to say that we don't have to have perfect food  but maybe it can also not be poison. Maybe we can have some middle ground for that. But I will continue to consider this idea  and I will report back maybe next year. Next. Next. Next.  Applause   Will there ever be a post racial world   Thank you for having me. My name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that. I'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation. I'm also half Lakota  but that is my given name  and no  even though it would have seemed like an obvious choice  no  I did not go into politics. Tough crowd. But I always like to just let people know when they ask about race or those kinds of things  you know  as a member of the First Nations community  you know  I'm probably not your typical guy. For example  in addition to being an activist  I'm also a professional stand up comedian. And  you know  I'm most popular on college and university campuses. You know  whenever they want to do a diversity day  or hey we're not all white week  then I'm there.  Laughter  Do I think there will ever be a post racial world  I think  really  I can't talk about race without remembering that it is a construct in certain respects  but also that  you know  until we redress the wrongs of the past  we're going to be turned around. I don't care if the present is the new future. I think there's a lot of great people here at TED who are working to address that  so with that  if anything I've said today makes you feel uncomfortable  you're welcome. I think we have time for one more.  What's the most popular diet these days   Who's here  Okay  well  I'm just gonna answer this really fast  as  like  three or four different people. I mean really fast. I'm just gonna let y'all know that  as far as diet is concerned  if you don't love yourself inside  there is no diet on this Earth that is going to make your behind small enough for you to feel good  so just stop wasting your time. I would just like to say as an African woman that I believe the diet that we need is really to remove the crazy belief that there is anything wrong with a nice backside. No  I am teasing about that. There is nothing wrong with a woman of size. That is what I am trying to say. Women  celebrate your body  for God's sake. Stop running around starving. You are making yourselves and other people miserable. Last answer. So we're talking about what's the most popular diet  I'm gonna start off by telling y'all that this is my first time here at TED. I might not be your typical person you find on this stage. My dental work not as nice as some people. But I made Sarah Jones promise she gonna bring me this time  'cause she didn't bring me before  but you know  I just want to say  there's a lot of things more important than counting calories  and as somebody living on the streets in New York  and getting to come here  hear y'all ideas worth spreading  I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea that the present is the new future  that where you sit  you create everything that's gonna come  for better or worse. And for me  I think homeless is the wrong word for it anyway. You know  I might not have me no place to lay my head at night  but that just makes me houseless. I have me a home. You do too. Find it and try to find yourself in there. Make sure you know  it's not just about virtual reality in space. That's wonderful  but it's also about the actual reality here on Earth. How are people living today  How can you be part of the solution  Thank y'all for thinking about that right now in the present moment to influence the future. I appreciate it. Bye bye. Thank you all very  very much. Thank you for trusting me  Chris. When I was a young officer  they told me to follow my instincts  to go with my gut  and what I've learned is that often our instincts are wrong. In the summer of       there was a massive leak of classified documents that came out of the Pentagon. It shocked the world  it shook up the American government  and it made people ask a lot of questions  because the sheer amount of information that was let out  and the potential impacts  were significant. And one of the first questions we asked ourselves was why would a young soldier have access to that much information  Why would we let sensitive things be with a relatively young person  In the summer of       I was assigned to command a special operations task force  and that task force was spread across the Mideast to fight al Qaeda. Our main effort was inside Iraq  and our specified mission was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq. For almost five years I stayed there  and we focused on fighting a war that was unconventional and it was difficult and it was bloody and it often claimed its highest price among innocent people. We did everything we could to stop al Qaeda and the foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers and as accelerants to the violence. We honed our combat skills  we developed new equipment  we parachuted  we helicoptered  we took small boats  we drove  and we walked to objectives night after night to stop the killing that this network was putting forward. We bled  we died  and we killed to stop that organization from the violence that they were putting largely against the Iraqi people. Now  we did what we knew  how we had grown up  and one of the things that we knew  that was in our DNA  was secrecy. It was security. It was protecting information. It was the idea that information was the lifeblood and it was what would protect and keep people safe. And we had a sense that  as we operated within our organizations  it was important to keep information in the silos within the organizations  particularly only give information to people had a demonstrated need to know. But the question often came  who needed to know  Who needed  who had to have the information so that they could do the important  parts of the job that you needed  And in a tightly coupled world  that's very hard to predict. It's very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn't. I used to deal with intelligence agencies  and I'd complain that they weren't sharing enough intelligence  and with a straight face  they'd look at me and they'd say   What aren't you getting    Laughter  I said   If I knew that  we wouldn't have a problem.  But what we found is we had to change. We had to change our culture about information. We had to knock down walls. We had to share. We had to change from who needs to know to the fact that who doesn't know  and we need to tell  and tell them as quickly as we can. It was a significant culture shift for an organization that had secrecy in its DNA. We started by doing things  by building  not working in offices  knocking down walls  working in things we called situation awareness rooms  and in the summer of       something happened which demonstrated this. We captured the personnel records for the people who were bringing foreign fighters into Iraq. And when we got the personnel records  typically  we would have hidden these  shared them with a few intelligence agencies  and then try to operate with them. But as I was talking to my intelligence officer  I said   What do we do   And he said   Well  you found them.  Our command.  You can just declassify them.  And I said   Well  can we declassify them  What if the enemy finds out   And he says   They're their personnel records.  So we did  and a lot of people got upset about that  but as we passed that information around  suddenly you find that information is only of value if you give it to people who have the ability to do something with it. The fact that I know something has zero value if I'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it. So as a consequence  what we did was we changed the idea of information  instead of knowledge is power  to one where sharing is power. It was the fundamental shift  not new tactics  not new weapons  not new anything else. It was the idea that we were now part of a team in which information became the essential link between us  not a block between us. And I want everybody to take a deep breath and let it out  because in your life  there's going to be information that leaks out you're not going to like. Somebody's going to get my college grades out  a that's going to be a disaster.  Laughter  But it's going to be okay  and I will tell you that I am more scared of the bureaucrat that holds information in a desk drawer or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks  because ultimately  we'll be better off if we share. Thank you. Helen Walters  So I don't know if you were here this morning  if you were able to catch Rick Ledgett  the deputy director of the NSA who was responding to Edward Snowden's talk earlier this week. I just wonder  do you think the American government should give Edward Snowden amnesty  Stanley McChrystal  I think that Rick said something very important. We  most people  don't know all the facts. I think there are two parts of this. Edward Snowden shined a light on an important need that people had to understand. He also took a lot of documents that he didn't have the knowledge to know the importance of  so I think we need to learn the facts about this case before we make snap judgments about Edward Snowden. HW  Thank you so much. Thank you. So  I have a feature on my website where every week people submit hypothetical questions for me to answer  and I try to answer them using math  science and comics. So for example  one person asked  what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at    percent of the speed of light  So I did some calculations. Now  normally  when an object flies through the air  the air will flow around the object  but in this case  the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn't have time to move out of the way. The ball would smash right into and through them  and the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen  carbon and hydrogen from the ball  fragmenting it off into tiny particles  and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it. This would result in a flood of x rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles  plasma inside  centered on the pitcher's mound  and that would move away from the pitcher's mound slightly faster than the ball. Now at this point  about    nanoseconds in  the home plate is far enough away that light hasn't had time to reach it  which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong. Now  after    nanoseconds  the ball will reach home plate  or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball  and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all as it also starts to carry them backward through the backstop  which also starts to disintegrate. So if you were watching this whole thing from a hill  ideally  far away  what you'd see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds  followed by a blast wave spreading out  shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium  and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city.  Laughter  So the Major League Baseball rules are a little bit hazy  but    Laughter    under rule  .   and  .    I think that in this situation  the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base  if it still existed. So this is the kind of question I answer  and I get people writing in with a lot of other strange questions. I've had someone write and say  scientifically speaking  what is the best and fastest way to hide a body  Can you do this one soon  And I had someone write in  I've had people write in about  can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart's broken  And I've had people send in what are clearly homework questions they're trying to get me to do for them. But one week  a couple months ago  I got a question that was actually about Google. If all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards  how big would Google's data warehouse be  Now  Google's pretty secretive about their operations  so no one really knows how much data Google has  and in fact  no one really knows how many data centers Google has  except people at Google itself. And I've tried  I've met them a few times  tried asking them  and they aren't revealing anything. So I decided to try to figure this out myself. There are a few things that I looked at here. I started with money. Google has to reveal how much they spend  in general  and that lets you put some caps on how many data centers could they be building  because a big data center costs a certain amount of money. And you can also then put a cap on how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up  which turns out  it's pretty sizable. I read a calculation at one point  I think Google has a drive failure about every minute or two  and they just throw out the hard drive and swap in a new one. So they go through a huge number of them. And so by looking at money  you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have. You can also look at power. You can look at how much electricity they need  because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers  and Google is more efficient than most  but they still have some basic requirements  and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have. You can also look at square footage and see of the data centers that you know  how big are they  How much room is that  How many server racks could you fit in there  And for some data centers  you might get two of these pieces of information. You know how much they spent  and they also  say  because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided  you might know what they made a deal to buy  so you know how much power it takes. Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers  and figure out for a data center where you don't have that information  you can figure out  but maybe you only have one of those  you know the square footage  then you could figure out well  maybe the power is proportional. And you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities  you know  with guesses about the total amount of storage  the number of servers  the number of drives per server  and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don't know. It's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get. And this is a lot of fun. The math is not all that advanced  and really it's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle. So what I did  I went through all of this information  spent a day or two researching. And there are some things I didn't look at. You could always look at the Google recruitment messages that they post. That gives you an idea of where they have people. Sometimes  when people visit a data center  they'll take a cell cam photo and post it  and they aren't supposed to  but you can learn things about their hardware that way. And in fact  you can just look at pizza delivery drivers. Turns out  they know where all the Google data centers are  at least the ones that have people in them. But I came up with my estimate  which I felt pretty good about  that was about    exabytes of data across all of Google's operations  and then another maybe five exabytes or so of offline storage in tape drives  which it turns out Google is about the world's largest consumer of. So I came up with this estimate  and this is a staggering amount of data. It's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has  as far as we know. There's a couple of other contenders  especially everyone always thinks of the NSA. But using some of these same methods  we can look at the NSA's data centers  and figure out  you know  we don't know what's going on there  but it's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of Google's. Adding all of this up  I came up with the other thing that we can answer  which is  how many punch cards would this take  And so a punch card can hold about    characters  and you can fit about       or so cards into a box  and you put them in  say  my home region of New England  it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers  which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about        years ago. So this is impractical  but I think that's about the best answer I could come up with. And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up. And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google  because of course they've been so secretive  they didn't answer of my questions  and so I just put it up and said  well  I guess we'll never know. But then a little while later I got a message  a couple weeks later  from Google  saying  hey  someone here has an envelope for you. So I go and get it  open it up  and it's punch cards.  Laughter  Google branded punch cards. And on these punch cards  there are a bunch of holes  and I said  thank you  thank you  okay  so what's on here  So I get some software and start reading it  and scan them  and it turns out it's a puzzle. There's a bunch of code  and I get some friends to help  and we crack the code  and then inside that is another code  and then there are some equations  and then we solve those equations  and then finally out pops a message from Google which is their official answer to my article  and it said   No comment.  And I love calculating these kinds of things  and it's not that I love doing the math. I do a lot of math  but I don't really like math for its own sake. What I love is that it lets you take some things that you know  and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper  find out something that you didn't know that's very surprising. And I have a lot of stupid questions  and I love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes. And sometimes not. This is a question I got from a reader  an anonymous reader  and the subject line just said   Urgent   and this was the entire email   If people had wheels and could fly  how would we differentiate them from airplanes   Urgent.  Laughter  And I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer. Thank you. I'm assuming everyone here has watched a TED Talk online at one time or another  right  So what I'm going to do is play this. This is the song from the TED Talks online. And I'm going to slow it down because things sound cooler when they're slower. Ken Robinson  Good morning. How are you  Mark Applebaum  I'm going to    Kate Stone     mix some music. MA  I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story. Tod Machover  Something nobody's ever heard before. KS  I have a crossfader. Julian Treasure  I call this the mixer. KS  Two D.J. decks. Chris Anderson  You turn up the  dials  the wheel starts to turn. Dan Ellsey  I have always loved music. Michael Tilson Thomas  Is it a melody  or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude  Daniel Wolpert  Feeling everything  that's going on inside my body. Adam Ockelford  In your brain is  this amazing musical computer. MTT  Using computers and synthesizers to create  works. It's a language that's still evolving. And the   st century. KR  Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque. You will know what this person  is doing  moving to the music. Mark Ronson  This is my favorite part. MA  You gotta have doorstops. That's important. TM  We all love music a great deal. MTT  Anthems  dance crazes  ballads and marches. Kirby Ferguson and JT  The remix  It  is new music created from old music. Ryan Holladay  Blend seamlessly. Kathryn Schulz  And that's how it goes. MTT  What happens when the music stops  KS  Yay  MR  Obviously  I've been watching a lot of TED Talks. When I was first asked to speak at TED  I wasn't quite sure what my angle was  at first  so yeah  I immediately started watching tons of TED Talks  which is pretty much absolutely the worst thing that you can do because you start to go into panic mode  thinking  I haven't mounted a successful expedition to the North Pole yet. Neither have I provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity. In fact  I've pretty much wasted most of my life DJing in night clubs and producing pop records. But I still kept watching the videos  because I'm a masochist  and eventually  things like Michael Tilson Thomas and Tod Machover  and seeing their visceral passion talking about music  it definitely stirred something in me  and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly about the power of music. And I started to write down on these little note cards every time I heard something that struck a chord in me  pardon the pun  or something that I thought I could use  and pretty soon  my studio looked like this  kind of like a John Nash   Beautiful Mind  vibe. The other good thing about watching TED Talks  when you see a really good one  you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker was your best friend  don't you  Like  just for a day. They seem like a nice person. You'd take a bike ride  maybe share an ice cream. You'd certainly learn a lot. And every now and then they'd chide you  when they got frustrated that you couldn't really keep up with half of the technical things they're banging on about all the time. But then they'd remember that you're but a mere human of ordinary  mortal intelligence that didn't finish university  and they'd kind of forgive you  and pet you like the dog. Man  yeah  back to the real world  probably Sir Ken Robinson and I are not going to end up being best of friends. He lives all the way in L.A. and I imagine is quite busy  but through the tools available to me    technology and the innate way that I approach making music    I can sort of bully our existences into a shared event  which is sort of what you saw. I can hear something that I love in a piece of media and I can co opt it and insert myself in that narrative  or alter it  even. In a nutshell  that's what I was trying to do with these things  but more importantly  that's what the past    years of music has been. That's the major thread. See     years ago  you had the first digital samplers  and they changed everything overnight. All of a sudden  artists could sample from anything and everything that came before them  from a snare drum from the Funky Meters  to a Ron Carter bassline  the theme to  The Price Is Right.  Albums like De La Soul's    Feet High and Rising  and the Beastie Boys'  Paul's Boutique  looted from decades of recorded music to create these sonic  layered masterpieces that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day. And they weren't sampling these records because they were too lazy to write their own music. They weren't sampling these records to cash in on the familiarity of the original stuff. To be honest  it was all about sampling really obscure things  except for a few obvious exceptions like Vanilla Ice and  doo doo doo da da doo doo  that we know about. But the thing is  they were sampling those records because they heard something in that music that spoke to them that they instantly wanted to inject themselves into the narrative of that music. They heard it  they wanted to be a part of it  and all of a sudden they found themselves in possession of the technology to do so  not much unlike the way the Delta blues struck a chord with the Stones and the Beatles and Clapton  and they felt the need to co opt that music for the tools of their day. You know  in music we take something that we love and we build on it. I'd like to play a song for you. That's  La Di Da Di  and it's the fifth most sampled song of all time. It's been sampled     times. It was made in      by these two legends of hip hop  Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh  and the Ray Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong. I do hope that comes back soon. Anyway  this predated the sampling era. There were no samples in this record  although I did look up on the Internet last night  I mean several months ago  that  La Di Da Di  means  it's an old Cockney expression from the late     s in England  so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore from  Downton Abbey  coming soon  or that's for another day. Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box. Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record  and because of Slick Rick's sing songy  super catchy vocals  it provides endless sound bites and samples for future pop records. That was     . This is me in       in case you were wondering how I was doing  thank you for asking. It's Throwback Thursday already. I was involved in a heavy love affair with the music of Duran Duran  as you can probably tell from my outfit. I was in the middle. And the simplest way that I knew how to co opt myself into that experience of wanting to be in that song somehow was to just get a band together of fellow nine year olds and play  Wild Boys  at the school talent show. So that's what we did  and long story short  we were booed off the stage  and if you ever have a chance to live your life escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium full of second  and third graders booing  I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun. But it didn't really matter  because what I wanted somehow was to just be in the history of that song for a minute. I didn't care who liked it. I just loved it  and I thought I could put myself in there. Over the next    years   La Di Da Di  continues to be sampled by countless records  ending up on massive hits like  Here Comes the Hotstepper  and  I Wanna Sex You Up.  Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song on his debut album  Doggystyle  and calls it  Lodi Dodi.  Copyright lawyers are having a field day at this point. And then you fast forward to       and the Notorious B.I.G.  or Biggie  reinterprets  La Di Da Di  on his number one hit called  Hypnotize   which I will play a little bit of and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick to show you where they got it from. So Biggie was killed weeks before that song made it to number one  in one of the great tragedies of the hip hop era  but he would have been    years old and very much alive when  La Di Da Di  first came out  and as a young boy growing up in Brooklyn  it's hard not to think that that song probably held some fond memories for him. But the way he interpreted it  as you hear  is completely his own. He flips it  makes it  there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it. It's thoroughly modern Biggie. I had to make that joke in this room  because you would be the only people that I'd ever have a chance of getting it. And so  it's a groaner.  Laughter  Elsewhere in the pop and rap world  we're going a little bit sample crazy. We're getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing  and all of a sudden everyone's taking these massive '  s tunes like Bowie   Let's Dance   and all these disco records  and just rapping on them. These records don't really age that well. You don't hear them now  because they borrowed from an era that was too steeped in its own connotation. You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale. It leaves the listener feeling sickly. You have to take an element of those things and then bring something fresh and new to it  which was something that I learned when I was working with the late  amazing Amy Winehouse on her album  Back to Black.  A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and Salaam Remi  the other producer  achieved  how we captured this long lost sound  but without the very  very   st century personality and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore and even a mention of Slick Rick  the whole thing would have run the risk of being very pastiche  to be honest. Imagine any other singer from that era over it singing the same old lyrics. It runs a risk of being completely bland. I mean  there was no doubt that Amy and I and Salaam all had this love for this gospel  soul and blues and jazz that was evident listening to the musical arrangements. She brought the ingredients that made it urgent and of the time. So if we come all the way up to the present day now  the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus  she reinterprets  La Di Da Di  completely for her generation  and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part and then see how she sort of flipped it. So Miley Cyrus  who wasn't even born yet when  La Di Da Di  was made  and neither were any of the co writers on the song  has found this song that somehow etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music  and now  with its timeless playfulness of the original  has kind of translated to a whole new generation who will probably co opt it as their own. Since the dawn of the sampling era  there's been endless debate about the validity of music that contains samples. You know  the Grammy committee says that if your song contains some kind of pre written or pre existing music  you're ineligible for song of the year. Rockists  who are racist but only about rock music  constantly use the argument to   That's a real word. That is a real word. They constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop  and these arguments completely miss the point  because the dam has burst. We live in the post sampling era. We take the things that we love and we build on them. That's just how it goes. And when we really add something significant and original and we merge our musical journey with this  then we have a chance to be a part of the evolution of that music that we love and be linked with it once it becomes something new again. So I would like to do one more piece that I put together for you tonight  and it takes place with two pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen. One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini  who happens to be a blind  autistic genius at the piano  and Emmanuel Jal  who is an ex child soldier from the South Sudan  who is a spoken word poet and rapper. And once again I found a way to annoyingly me me me myself into the musical history of these songs  but I can't help it  because they're these things that I love  and I want to mess around with them. So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go. Let's hear that TED sound again  right  Thank you very much. Thank you. So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank  and it's clear that the general public needs guidance  because the average bank robbery nets only       dollars. Rank amateurs who know nothing about how to cook the books. The folks who know  of course  run our largest banks  and in the last go around  they cost us over    trillion dollars. That's what    trillion looks like. That's how many zeros  And cost us over    million jobs as well. So our task is to educate ourselves so that we can understand why we have these recurrent  intensifying financial crises  and how we can prevent them in the future. And the answer to that is that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud. Control fraud is what happens when the people who control  typically a CEO  a seemingly legitimate entity  use it as a weapon to defraud. And these are the weapons of mass destruction in the financial world. They also follow in finance a particular strategy  because the weapon of choice in finance is accounting  and there is a recipe for accounting control fraud  and how it occurs. And we discovered this recipe in quite an odd way that I'll come back to in a moment. First ingredient in the recipe  grow like crazy  second  by making or buying really crappy loans  but loans that are made at a very high interest rate or yield  three  while employing extreme leverage    that just means a lot of debt    compared to your equity  and four  while providing only trivial loss reserves against the inevitable losses. If you follow those four simple steps  and any bank can follow them  then you are mathematically guaranteed to have three things occur. The first thing is you will report record bank profits    not just high  record. Two  the CEO will immediately be made incredibly wealthy by modern executive compensation. And three  farther down the road  the bank will suffer catastrophic losses and will fail unless it is bailed out. And that's a hint as to how we discovered this recipe  because we discovered it through an autopsy process. During the savings and loan debacle in       we looked at every single failure  and we looked for common characteristics  and we discovered this recipe was common to each of these frauds. In other words  a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe that will destroy the banks as well as the economy. And it also turns out to be precisely what could have stopped this crisis  the one that cost us    trillion dollars just in the household sector  that cost us    million jobs  was the easiest financial crisis by far to have avoided completely if we had simply learned the lessons of epidemics of control fraud  particularly using this recipe. So let's go to this crisis  and the two huge epidemics of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis    appraisal fraud and liar's loans    and what we're going to see in looking at both of these is we got warnings that were incredibly early about these frauds. We got warnings that we could have taken advantage of easily  because back in the savings and loan debacle  we had figured out how to respond and prevent these crises. And three  the warnings were unambiguous. They were obvious that what was going on was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up. Let's take appraisal fraud first. This is simply where you inflate the value of the home that is being pledged as security for the loan. In       the year       that is over a year before Enron fails  by the way  the honest appraisers got together a formal petition begging the federal government to act  and the industry to act  to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud. And the appraisers explained how it was occurring  that banks were demanding that appraisers inflate the appraisal  and that if the appraisers refused to do so  they  the banks  would blacklist honest appraisers and refuse to use them. Now  we've seen this before in the savings and loan debacle  and we know that this kind of fraud can only originate from the lenders  and that no honest lender would ever inflate the appraisal  because it's the great protection against loss. So this was an incredibly early warning      . It was something we'd seen before  and it was completely unambiguous. This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud led by the banks. What about liar's loans  Well  that warning actually comes earlier. The savings and loan debacle is basically the early     s through       and in the midst of fighting that wave of accounting control fraud  in       we found that a second front of fraud was being started. And like all good financial frauds in America  it began in Orange County  California. And we happened to be the regional regulators for it. And our examiners said  they are making loans without even checking what the borrower's income is. This is insane  it has to lead to massive losses  and it only makes sense for entities engaged in these accounting control frauds. And we said  yeah  you're absolutely right  and we drove those liar's loans out of the industry in      and       but we could only deal with the industry we had jurisdiction over  which was savings and loans  and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds  Long Beach Savings  voluntarily gave up its federal savings and loan charter  gave up federal deposit insurance  converted to become a mortgage bank for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction  and changed its name to Ameriquest  and became the most notorious of the liar's loans frauds early on  and to add to that  they deliberately predated upon minorities. So we knew again about this crisis. We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before. We had incredibly early warnings of it  and it was absolutely unambiguous that no honest lender would make loans in this fashion. So let's take a look at the reaction of the industry and the regulators and the prosecutors to these clear early warnings that could have prevented the crisis. Start with the industry. The industry responded between      and      by increasing liar's loans by over     percent. These were the loans that hyperinflated the bubble and produced the economic crisis. By       half of all the loans called subprime were also liar's loans. They're not mutually exclusive  it's just that together  they're the most toxic combination you can possibly imagine. By          percent of all the loans made that year  all the home loans made that year  were liar's loans     percent. And this is despite a warning from the industry's own antifraud experts that said that these loans were an open invitation to fraudsters  and that they had a fraud incidence of    percent  nine zero. In response to that  the industry first started calling these loans liar's loans  which lacks a certain subtlety  and second  massively increased them  and no government regulator ever required or encouraged any lender to make a liar's loan or anyone to purchase a liar's loan  and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie. This came from the lenders because of the fraud recipe. What happened to appraisal fraud  It expanded remarkably as well. By       when a survey of appraisers was done     percent of appraisers reported that they had been subject to coercion from the lenders trying to get them to inflate an appraisal. In other words  both forms of fraud became absolutely endemic and normal  and this is what drove the bubble. What happened in the governmental sector  Well  the government  as I told you  when we were the savings and loan regulators  we could only deal with our industry  and if people gave up their federal deposit insurance  we couldn't do anything to them. Congress  it may strike you as impossible  but actually did something intelligent in       and passed the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act that gave the Fed  and only the Federal Reserve  the explicit  statutory authority to ban liar's loans by every lender  whether or not they had federal deposit insurance. So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan  as chairs of the Fed  do when they got these warnings that these were massively fraudulent loans and that they were being sold to the secondary market  Remember  there's no fraud exorcist. Once it starts out a fraudulent loan  it can only be sold to the secondary market through more frauds  lying about the reps and warrantees  and then those people are going to produce mortgage backed securities and exotic derivatives which are also going to be supposedly backed by those fraudulent loans. So the fraud is going to progress through the entire system  hyperinflate the bubble  produce a disaster. And remember  we had experience with this. We had seen significant losses  and we had experience of competent regulators in stopping it. Greenspan and Bernanke refused to use the authority under the statute to stop liar's loans. And this was a matter first of dogma. They're just horrifically opposed to anything regulatory. But it is also the international competition in laxity  the race to the bottom between the United States and the United Kingdom  the city of London  in particular  and the city of London won that race to the bottom  but it meant that all regulation in the West was completely degraded in this stupid competition to be who could have the weakest regulation. So that was the regulatory response. What about the response of the prosecutors after the crisis  after    trillion dollars in losses  after    million jobs lost  a crisis in which the losses and the frauds were more than    times larger than the savings and loan debacle  Well  in the savings and loan debacle  our agency that regulated savings and loans  OTS  made over        criminal referrals  produced over       felony convictions just in cases designated as major  and that understates the degree of prioritization  because we worked with the FBI to create the list of the top     fraud schemes  the absolute worst of the worst  nationwide. Roughly     savings and loans involved  roughly     senior officials. Virtually all of them were prosecuted. We had a    percent conviction rate. It's the greatest success against elite white collar criminals ever  and it was because of this understanding of control fraud and the accounting control fraud mechanism. Flash forward to the current crisis. The same agency  Office of Thrift Supervision  which was supposed to regulate many of the largest makers of liar's loans in the country  has made  even today    it no longer exists  but as of a year ago  it had made zero criminal referrals. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  which is supposed to regulate the largest national banks  has made zero criminal referrals. The Fed appears to have made zero criminal referrals. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is smart enough to refuse to answer the question. Without any guidance from the regulators  there's no expertise in the FBI to investigate complex frauds. It isn't simply that they've had to reinvent the wheel of how to do these prosecutions  they've forgotten that the wheel exists  and therefore  we have zero prosecutions  and of course  zero convictions  of any of the elite bank frauds  the Wall Street types  that drove this crisis. With no expertise coming from the regulators  the FBI formed what it calls a partnership with the Mortgage Bankers Association in     . The Mortgage Bankers Association is the trade association of the perps. And the Mortgage Bankers Association set out  it had the audacity and the success to con the FBI. It had created a supposed definition of mortgage fraud  in which  guess what  its members are always the victim and never the perpetrators. And the FBI has bought this hook  line  sinker  rod  reel and the boat they rode out in. And so the FBI  under the leadership of an attorney general who is African American and a president of the United States who is African American  have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis  in which it is the first virgin crisis in history  conceived without sin in the executive ranks. And it's those oh so clever hairdressers who were able to defraud the poor  pitiful banks  who lack any financial sophistication. It is the silliest story you can conceive of  and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers  and they leave the banksters alone entirely. And so  while lions are roaming the campsite  the FBI is chasing mice. What do we need to do  What can we do in all of this  We need to change the perverse incentive structures that produce these recurrent epidemics of accounting control fraud that are driving our crises. So we have to first get rid of the systemically dangerous institutions. These are the so called too big to fail institutions. We need to shrink them to the point  within the next five years  that they no longer pose a systemic risk. Right now  they are ticking time bombs that will cause a global crisis as soon as the next one fails    not if  when. Second thing we need to do is completely reform modern executive and professional compensation  which is what they use to suborn the appraisers. Remember  they were pressuring the appraisers through the compensation system  trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic  in which bad ethics drives good ethics out of the marketplace. And they largely succeeded  which is how the fraud became endemic. And the third thing that we need to do is deal with what we call the three D's  deregulation  desupervision  and the de facto decriminalization. Because we can make all three of these changes  and if we do so  we can dramatically reduce how often we have a crisis and how severe those crises are. That is not simply critical to our economy. You can see what these crises do to inequality and what they do to our democracy. They have produced crony capitalism  American style  in which the largest financial institutions are the leading financial donors of both parties  and that's the reason why even after this crisis     times larger than the savings and loan crisis  we have no meaningful reforms in any of the three areas that I've talked about  other than banning liar's loans  which is good  but that's just one form of ammunition for this fraud weapon. There are many forms of ammunition they can use. That's why we need to learn what the bankers have learned  the recipe for the best way to rob a bank  so that we can stop that recipe  because our legislators  who are dependent on political contributions  will not do it on their own. Thank you very much. I study ants in the desert  in the tropical forest and in my kitchen  and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live. I've recently realized that ants are using interactions differently in different environments  and that got me thinking that we could learn from this about other systems  like brains and data networks that we engineer  and even cancer. So what all these systems have in common is that there's no central control. An ant colony consists of sterile female workers    those are the ants you see walking around   and then one or more reproductive females who just lay the eggs. They don't give any instructions. Even though they're called queens  they don't tell anybody what to do. So in an ant colony  there's no one in charge  and all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple interactions. Ants interact using smell. They smell with their antennae  and they interact with their antennae  so when one ant touches another with its antennae  it can tell  for example  if the other ant is a nestmate and what task that other ant has been doing. So here you see a lot of ants moving around and interacting in a lab arena that's connected by tubes to two other arenas. So when one ant meets another  it doesn't matter which ant it meets  and they're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message. All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants. And all of these interactions  taken together  produce a network. So this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena  and it's this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony  like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest  or how many are going out to forage. A brain actually works in the same way  but what's great about ants is that you can see the whole network as it happens. There are more than        species of ants  in every conceivable environment  and they're using interactions differently to meet different environmental challenges. So one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs  just what it takes to run the system. And another environmental challenge is resources  finding them and collecting them. In the desert  operating costs are high because water is scarce  and the seed eating ants that I study in the desert have to spend water to get water. So an ant outside foraging  searching for seeds in the hot sun  just loses water into the air. But the colony gets its water by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds that they eat. So in this environment  interactions are used to activate foraging. An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning foragers  and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel  into the nest  and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out. This makes sense for the ant colony  because the more food there is out there  the more quickly the foragers find it  the faster they come back  and the more foragers they send out. The system works to stay stopped  unless something positive happens. So interactions function to activate foragers. And we've been studying the evolution of this system. First of all  there's variation. It turns out that colonies are different. On dry days  some colonies forage less  so colonies are different in how they manage this trade off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds. And we're trying to understand why some colonies forage less than others by thinking about ants as neurons  using models from neuroscience. So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire  an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to forage. And what we're looking for is whether there might be small differences among colonies in how many interactions each ant needs before it's willing to go out and forage  because a colony like that would forage less. And this raises an analogous question about brains. We talk about the brain  but of course every brain is slightly different  and maybe there are some individuals or some conditions in which the electrical properties of neurons are such that they require more stimulus to fire  and that would lead to differences in brain function. So in order to ask evolutionary questions  we need to know about reproductive success. This is a map of the study site where I have been tracking this population of harvester ant colonies for    years  which is about as long as a colony lives. Each symbol is a colony  and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had  because we were able to use genetic variation to match up parent and offspring colonies  that is  to figure out which colonies were founded by a daughter queen produced by which parent colony. And this was amazing for me  after all these years  to find out  for example  that colony      whom I've known well for many years  is a great grandmother. Here's her daughter colony  here's her granddaughter colony  and these are her great granddaughter colonies. And by doing this  I was able to learn that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies in their decisions about which days are so hot that they don't forage  and the offspring of parent colonies live so far from each other that the ants never meet  so the ants of the offspring colony can't be learning this from the parent colony. And so our next step is to look for the genetic variation underlying this resemblance. So then I was able to ask  okay  who's doing better  Over the time of the study  and especially in the past    years  there's been a very severe and deepening drought in the Southwestern U.S.  and it turns out that the colonies that conserve water  that stay in when it's really hot outside  and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible  are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies. So all this time  I thought that colony     was a loser  because on really dry days  there'd be just this trickle of foraging  while the other colonies were out foraging  getting lots of food  but in fact  colony     is a huge success. She's a matriarch. She's one of the rare great grandmothers on the site. To my knowledge  this is the first time that we've been able to track the ongoing evolution of collective behavior in a natural population of animals and find out what's actually working best. Now  the Internet uses an algorithm to regulate the flow of data that's very similar to the one that the harvester ants are using to regulate the flow of foragers. And guess what we call this analogy  The anternet is coming. So data doesn't leave the source computer unless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth for it to travel on. In the early days of the Internet  when operating costs were really high and it was really important not to lose any data  then the system was set up for interactions to activate the flow of data. It's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm that's so similar to the one that we recently invented  but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms that we know about  and ants have had     million years to evolve a lot of good ones  and I think it's very likely that some of the other        species are going to have interesting algorithms for data networks that we haven't even thought of yet. So what happens when operating costs are low  Operating costs are low in the tropics  because it's very humid  and it's easy for the ants to be outside walking around. But the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics that there's a lot of competition. Whatever resource one species is using  another species is likely to be using that at the same time. So in this environment  interactions are used in the opposite way. The system keeps going unless something negative happens  and one species that I study makes circuits in the trees of foraging ants going from the nest to a food source and back  just round and round  unless something negative happens  like an interaction with ants of another species. So here's an example of ant security. In the middle  there's an ant plugging the nest entrance with its head in response to interactions with another species. Those are the little ones running around with their abdomens up in the air. But as soon as the threat is passed  the entrance is open again  and maybe there are situations in computer security where operating costs are low enough that we could just block access temporarily in response to an immediate threat  and then open it again  instead of trying to build a permanent firewall or fortress. So another environmental challenge that all systems have to deal with is resources  finding and collecting them. And to do this  ants solve the problem of collective search  and this is a problem that's of great interest right now in robotics  because we've understood that  rather than sending a single  sophisticated  expensive robot out to explore another planet or to search a burning building  that instead  it may be more effective to get a group of cheaper robots exchanging only minimal information  and that's the way that ants do it. So the invasive Argentine ant makes expandable search networks. They're good at dealing with the main problem of collective search  which is the trade off between searching very thoroughly and covering a lot of ground. And what they do is  when there are many ants in a small space  then each one can search very thoroughly because there will be another ant nearby searching over there  but when there are a few ants in a large space  then they need to stretch out their paths to cover more ground. I think they use interactions to assess density  so when they're really crowded  they meet more often  and they search more thoroughly. Different ant species must use different algorithms  because they've evolved to deal with different resources  and it could be really useful to know about this  and so we recently asked ants to solve the collective search problem in the extreme environment of microgravity in the International Space Station. When I first saw this picture  I thought  Oh no  they've mounted the habitat vertically  but then I realized that  of course  it doesn't matter. So the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang on to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it that they're less likely to interact  and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up. We're still analyzing the data. I don't have the results yet. But it would be interesting to know how other species solve this problem in different environments on Earth  and so we're setting up a program to encourage kids around the world to try this experiment with different species. It's very simple. It can be done with cheap materials. And that way  we could make a global map of ant collective search algorithms. And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species  the ones that come into our buildings  are going to be really good at this  because they're in your kitchen because they're really good at finding food and water. So the most familiar resource for ants is a picnic  and this is a clustered resource. When there's one piece of fruit  there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby  and the ants that specialize on clustered resources use interactions for recruitment. So when one ant meets another  or when it meets a chemical deposited on the ground by another  then it changes direction to follow in the direction of the interaction  and that's how you get the trail of ants sharing your picnic. Now this is a place where I think we might be able to learn something from ants about cancer. I mean  first  it's obvious that we could do a lot to prevent cancer by not allowing people to spread around or sell the toxins that promote the evolution of cancer in our bodies  but I don't think the ants can help us much with this because ants never poison their own colonies. But we might be able to learn something from ants about treating cancer. There are many different kinds of cancer. Each one originates in a particular part of the body  and then some kinds of cancer will spread or metastasize to particular other tissues where they must be getting resources that they need. So if you think from the perspective of early metastatic cancer cells as they're out searching around for the resources that they need  if those resources are clustered  they're likely to use interactions for recruitment  and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting  then maybe we could set traps to catch them before they become established. So ants are using interactions in different ways in a huge variety of environments  and we could learn from this about other systems that operate without central control. Using only simple interactions  ant colonies have been performing amazing feats for more than     million years. We have a lot to learn from them. Thank you. I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after    years of service. The majority of those    years was spent patrolling the southern end of Marin County  which includes the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge is an iconic structure  known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco  the Pacific Ocean  and its inspiring architecture. Unfortunately  it is also a magnet for suicide  being one of the most utilized sites in the world. The Golden Gate Bridge opened in     . Joseph Strauss  chief engineer in charge of building the bridge  was quoted as saying   The bridge is practically suicide proof. Suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable.  But since its opening  over       people have leapt to their death from that bridge. Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension    this bridge has been romanticized as such   that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief  and the waters below will cleanse your soul. But let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide. After a free fall of four to five seconds  the body strikes the water at about    miles an hour. That impact shatters bones  some of which then puncture vital organs. Most die on impact. Those that don't generally flail in the water helplessly  and then drown. I don't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face. This is the cord. Except for around the two towers  there is    inches of steel paralleling the bridge. This is where most folks stand before taking their lives. I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cord  and at their darkest time  it is very difficult to bring them back. I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life. I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail. When I first began working on the bridge  we had no formal training. You struggled to funnel your way through these calls. This was not only a disservice to those contemplating suicide  but to the officers as well. We've come a long  long way since then. Now  veteran officers and psychologists train new officers. This is Jason Garber. I met Jason on July    of last year when I get received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the cord near midspan. I responded  and when I arrived  I observed Jason speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer. Jason was just    years old and had flown out here from New Jersey. As a matter of fact  he had flown out here on two other occasions from New Jersey to attempt suicide on this bridge. After about an hour of speaking with Jason  he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box. Recalling your Greek mythology  Zeus created Pandora  and sent her down to Earth with a box  and told her   Never  ever open that box.  Well one day  curiosity got the better of Pandora  and she did open the box. Out flew plagues  sorrows  and all sorts of evils against man. The only good thing in the box was hope. Jason then asked us   What happens when you open the box and hope isn't there   He paused a few moments  leaned to his right  and was gone. This kind  intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide. I spoke with Jason's parents that evening  and I suppose that  when I was speaking with them  that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well  because that very next day  their family rabbi called to check on me. Jason's parents had asked him to do so. The collateral damage of suicide affects so many people. I pose these questions to you  What would you do if your family member  friend or loved one was suicidal  What would you say  Would you know what to say  In my experience  it's not just the talking that you do  but the listening. Listen to understand. Don't argue  blame  or tell the person you know how they feel  because you probably don't. By just being there  you may just be the turning point that they need. If you think someone is suicidal  don't be afraid to confront them and ask the question. One way of asking them the question is like this   Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life  have you had these thoughts   Confronting the person head on may just save their life and be the turning point for them. Some other signs to look for  hopelessness  believing that things are terrible and never going to get better  helplessness  believing that there is nothing that you can do about it  recent social withdrawal  and a loss of interest in life. I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago  and I received an email from a lady that I'd like to read you her letter. She lost her son on January    of this year  and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago  and it's with her permission and blessing that I read this to you.  Hi  Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference. That must be quite the experience to be there. I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend. Just wanted to drop you a note. Hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends  etc. I'm still pretty numb  but noticing more moments of really realizing Mike isn't coming home. Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco to watch the   ers game with his father on January   . He never made it there. I called Petaluma police and reported him missing that evening. The next morning  two officers came to my home and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge. A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at      p.m. the previous day. Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves. Who hasn't been low before without suffering from a true mental illness  It shouldn't be so easy to end it. My prayers are with you for your fight. The GGB  Golden Gate Bridge  is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay  not a graveyard. Good luck this week. Vicky.  I can't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day  and also the courage just to carry on. I'd like to introduce you to a man I refer to as hope and courage. On March    of       I responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the north tower. I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed this man  Kevin Berthia  standing on the sidewalk. When he saw me  he immediately traversed that pedestrian rail  and stood on that small pipe which goes around the tower. For the next hour and a half  I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness. Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance. When Kevin came back over  I congratulated him.  This is a new beginning  a new life.  But I asked him   What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance   And you know what he told me  He said   You listened. You let me speak  and you just listened.  Shortly after this incident  I received a letter from Kevin's mother  and I have that letter with me  and I'd like to read it to you.  Dear Mr. Briggs  Nothing will erase the events of March     but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us. I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help. He has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medicated. I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old  completely unaware of any hereditary traits  but  thank God  now we know. Kevin is straight  as he says. We truly thank God for you. Sincerely indebted to you  Narvella Berthia.  And on the bottom she writes   P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening  you were listed as the patient. Boy  did I have to straighten that one out.  Today  Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society. He speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others. Suicide is not just something I've encountered on the job. It's personal. My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning. That act  although ending his own pain  robbed me from ever getting to know him. This is what suicide does. For most suicidal folks  or those contemplating suicide  they wouldn't think of hurting another person. They just want their own pain to end. Typically  this is accomplished in just three ways  sleep  drugs or alcohol  or death. In my career  I've responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge. Of those incidents I've been directly involved with  I've only lost two  but that's two too many. One was Jason. The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour. During that time  he shook my hand on three occasions. On that final handshake  he looked at me  and he said   Kevin  I'm sorry  but I have to go.  And he leapt. Horrible  absolutely horrible. I do want to tell you  though  the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide. Additionally  that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it  that one to two percent  most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail  they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live. I tell people  the bridge not only connects Marin to San Francisco  but people together also. That connection  or bridge that we make  is something that each and every one of us should strive to do. Suicide is preventable. There is help. There is hope. Thank you very much.  Pheromone  is a very powerful word. It conjures up sex  abandon  loss of control  and you can see  it's very important as a word. But it's only    years old. It was invented in     . Now  if you put that word into the web  as you may have done  you'll come up with millions of hits  and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you something to make you irresistible for    dollars or more. Now  this is a very attractive idea  and the molecules they mention sound really science y. They've got lots of syllables. It's things like androstenol  androstenone or androstadienone. It gets better and better  and when you combine that with white lab coats  you must imagine that there is fantastic science behind this. But sadly  these are fraudulent claims supported by dodgy science. The problem is that  although there are many good scientists working on what they think are human pheromones  and they're publishing in respectable journals  at the basis of this  despite very sophisticated experiments  there really is no good science behind it  because it's based on a problem  which is nobody has systematically gone through all the odors that humans produce    and there are thousands of molecules that we give off. We're mammals. We produce a lot of smell. Nobody has gone through systematically to work out which molecules really are pheromones. They've just plucked a few  and all these experiments are based on those  but there's no good evidence at all. Now  that's not to say that smell is not important to people. It is  and some people are real enthusiasts  and one of these was Napoleon. And famously  you may remember that out on the campaign trail for war  he wrote to his lover  Empress Josephine  saying   Don't wash. I'm coming home.  So he didn't want to lose any of her richness in the days before he'd get home  and it is still  you'll find websites that offer this as a major quirk. At the same time  though  we spend about as much money taking the smells off us as putting them back on in perfumes  and perfumes are a multi billion dollar business. So what I want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you about what pheromones really are  tell you why I think we would expect humans to have pheromones  tell you about some of the confusions in pheromones  and then finally  I want to end with a promising avenue which shows us the way we ought to be going. So the ancient Greeks knew that dogs sent invisible signals between each other. A female dog in heat sent an invisible signal to male dogs for miles around  and it wasn't a sound  it was a smell. You could take the smell from the female dog  and the dogs would chase the cloth. But the problem for everybody who could see this effect was that you couldn't identify the molecules. You couldn't demonstrate it was chemical. The reason for that  of course  is that each of these animals produces tiny quantities  and in the case of the dog  males dogs can smell it  but we can't smell it. And it was only in      that a German team  after spending    years in search of these molecules  discovered  identified  the first pheromone  and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth. Now  this was an inspired choice  by Adolf Butenandt and his team  because he needed half a million moths to get enough material to do the chemical analysis. But he created the model for how you should go about pheromone analysis. He basically went through systematically  showing that only the molecule in question was the one that stimulated the males  not all the others. He analyzed it very carefully. He synthesized the molecule  and then tried the synthesized molecule on the males and got them to respond and showed it was  indeed  that molecule. That's closing the circle. That's the thing which has never been done with humans  nothing systematic  no real demonstration. With that new concept  we needed a new word  and that was the word  pheromone   and it's basically transferred excitement  transferred between individuals  and since       pheromones have been found right the way across the animal kingdom  in male animals  in female animals. It works just as well underwater for goldfish and lobsters. And almost every mammal you can think of has had a pheromone identified  and of course  an enormous number of insects. So we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom. What about humans  Well  the first thing  of course  is that we're mammals  and mammals are smelly. As any dog owner can tell you  we smell  they smell. But the real reason we might think that humans have pheromones is the change that occurs as we grow up. The smell of a room of teenagers is quite different from the smell of a room of small children. What's changed  And of course  it's puberty. Along with the pubic hair and the hair in the armpits  new glands start to secrete in those places  and that's what's making the change in smell. If we were any other kind of mammal  or any other kind of animal  we would say   That must be something to do with pheromones   and we'd start looking properly. But there are some problems  and this is why  I think  people have not looked for pheromones so effectively in humans. There are  indeed  problems. And the first of these is perhaps surprising. It's all about culture. Now moths don't learn a lot about what is good to smell  but humans do  and up to the age of about four  any smell  no matter how rancid  is simply interesting. And I understand that the major role of parents is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo  because it's always something nice to smell. But gradually we learn what's not good  and one of the things we learn at the same time as what is not good is what is good. Now  the cheese behind me is a British  if not an English  delicacy. It's ripe blue Stilton. Liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries. Every culture has its own special food and national delicacy. If you were to come from Iceland  your national dish is deep rotted shark. Now  all of these things are acquired tastes  but they form almost a badge of identity. You're part of the in group. The second thing is the sense of smell. Each of us has a unique odor world  in the sense that what we smell  we each smell a completely different world. Now  smell was the hardest of the senses to crack  and the Nobel Prize awarded to Richard Axel and Linda Buck was only awarded in      for their discovery of how smell works. It's really hard  but in essence  nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors  and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors  and if they bond  they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain. We don't just have one kind of receptor. If you're a human  you have about     different kinds of receptors  and the brain knows what you're smelling because of the combination of receptors and nerve cells that they trigger  sending messages up to the brain in a combinatorial fashion. But it's a bit more complicated  because each of those     comes in various variants  and depending which variant you have  you might smell coriander  or cilantro  that herb  either as something delicious and savory or something like soap. So we each have an individual world of smell  and that complicates anything when we're studying smell. Well  we really ought to talk about armpits  and I have to say that I do have particularly good ones. Now  I'm not going to share them with you  but this is the place that most people have looked for pheromones. There is one good reason  which is  the great apes have armpits as their unique characteristic. The other primates have scent glands in other parts of the body. The great apes have these armpits full of secretory glands producing smells all the time  enormous numbers of molecules. When they're secreted from the glands  the molecules are odorless. They have no smell at all  and it's only the wonderful bacteria growing on the rainforest of hair that actually produces the smells that we know and love. And so incidentally  if you want to reduce the amount of smell  clear cutting your armpits is a very effective way of reducing the habitat for bacteria  and you'll find they remain less smelly for much longer. But although we've focused on armpits  I think it's partly because they're the least embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples. There is actually another reason why we might not be looking for a universal sex pheromone there  and that's because    percent of the world's population doesn't have smelly armpits like me. And these are people from China  Japan  Korea  and other parts of northeast Asia. They simply don't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits. So it doesn't apply to    percent of the world. So what should we be doing in our search for human pheromones  I'm fairly convinced that we do have them. We're mammals  like everybody else who's a mammal  and we probably do have them. But what I think we should do is go right back to the beginning  and basically look all over the body. No matter how embarrassing  we need to search and go for the first time where no one else has dared tread. It's going to be difficult  it's going to be embarrassing  but we need to look. We also need to go back to the ideas that Butenandt used when he was studying the silk moth. We need to go back and look systematically at all the molecules that are being produced  and work out which ones are really involved. It isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple and say   They'll do.  We have to actually demonstrate that they really have the effects we claim. There is one team that I'm actually very impressed by. They're in France  and their previous success was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone. They've turned their attention now to human babies and mothers. So this is a baby having a drink of milk from its mother's breast. Her nipple is completely hidden by the baby's head  but what you'll notice is a white droplet with an arrow pointing to it  and that's the secretion from the areolar glands. Now  we all have them  men and women  and these are the little bumps around the nipple  and if you're a lactating woman  these start to secrete. It's a very interesting secretion. What Benoist Schaal and his team developed was a simple test to investigate what the effect of this secretion might be  in effect  a simple bioassay. So this is a sleeping baby  and under its nose  we've put a clean glass rod. The baby remains sleeping  showing no interest at all. But if we go to any mother who is secreting from the areolar glands  so it's not about recognition  it can be from any mother  if we take the secretion and now put it under the baby's nose  we get a very different reaction. It's a connoisseur's reaction of delight  and it opens its mouth and sticks out its tongue and starts to suck. Now  since this is from any mother  it could really be a pheromone. It's not about individual recognition. Any mother will do. Now  why is this important  apart from being simply very interesting  It's because women vary in the number of areolar glands that they have  and there is a correlation between the ease with which babies start to suckle and the number of areolar glands she has. It appears that the more secretions she's got  the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly. If you're a mammal  the most dangerous time in life is the first few hours after birth. You have to get that first drink of milk  and if you don't get it  you won't survive. You'll be dead. Since many babies actually find it difficult to take that first meal  because they're not getting the right stimulus  if we could identify what that molecule was  and the French team are being very cautious  but if we could identify the molecule  synthesize it  it would then mean premature babies would be more likely to suckle  and every baby would have a better chance of survival. So what I want to argue is this is one example of where a systematic  really scientific approach can actually bring you a real understanding of pheromones. There could be all sorts of medical interventions. There could be all sorts of things that humans are doing with pheromones that we simply don't know at the moment. What we need to remember is pheromones are not just about sex. They're about all sorts of things to do with a mammal's life. So do go forward and do search for more. There's lots to find. Thank you very much. The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online started out the way most things do  without me  and not online. On December           the man on the medal  Alfred Nobel  died. One hundred years later  exactly  actually  December           this charming lady  Wislawa Szymborska  won the Nobel Prize for literature. She's a Polish poet. She's a big deal  obviously  but back in '    I thought I had never heard of her  and when I checked out her work  I found this sweet little poem   Four in the Morning.   The hour from night to day. The hour from side to side. The hour for those past thirty...  And it goes on  but as soon as I read this poem  I fell for it hard  so hard  I suspected we must have met somewhere before. Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem  Did I flirt with this poem in a coffee shop somewhere  I could not place it  and it bugged me  and then in the coming week or two  I would just be watching an old movie  and this would happen. We didn't get home till around four in the morning. Rives  My roommates would have the TV on  and this would happen. watching that Omen trilogy. Rives  I would be listening to music  and this would happen. Rives  So you can see what was going on  right  Obviously  the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me. Some people get a number stuck in their head  you may recognize a certain name or a tune  some people get nothing  but four in the morning was in me now  but mildly  like a groin injury. I always assumed it would just go away on its own eventually  and I never talked about it with anybody  but it did not  and I totally did. In       I was invited to speak at TED for the second time  and since I was still an authority on nothing  I thought  what if I made a multimedia presentation on a topic so niche it is actually inconsequential or actually cockamamie. So my talk had some of my four in the morning examples  but it also had examples from my fellow TED speakers that year. I found four in the morning in a novel by Isabel Allende. I found a really great one in the autobiography of Bill Clinton. I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening  although Matt Groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and I gather that he is not an early riser. However  had Matt been there  he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory that was un freaking canny for me to assemble. It was totally contrived just for that room  just for that moment. That's how we did it in the pre TED.com days. It was fun. That was pretty much it. When I got home  though  the emails started coming in from people who had seen the talk live  beginning with  and this is still my favorite   Here's another one for your collection  'It's the friends you can call up at   a.m. that matter.'  The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich. The email itself was from another very sexy European type  TED Curator Chris Anderson. Chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something  and I'm thinking  this man is the Typhoid Mary of ideas worth spreading  and I have infected him. I am contagious  which was confirmed less than a week later when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent an actual greeting card with that same quotation. As a bonus  she hooked me up with a second one they make. It says   Just knowing I can call you at four in the morning if I need to makes me not really need to   which I love  because together these are like   Hallmark  When you care enough to send the very best twice  phrased slightly differently.  I was not surprised at the TEDster and New Yorker magazine overlap. A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.  It's   a.m. maybe you'd sleep better if you bought some crap.  I was surprised at the TEDster  Rugrats  overlap. More than one person sent me this. Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding  Stu Pickles  Because I've lost control of my life. Rives  And then there was the lone TEDster who was disgruntled I had overlooked what he considers to be a classic. Roy  No  it's not an accident. You wanted to get out of the house anyway  right  Ronnie  Not at four o'clock in the morning. Rives  So that's  Close Encounters   and the main character is all worked up because aliens  momentously  have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning  which does make that a very solid example. Those were all really solid examples. They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem. But they followed the pattern. They played along. Right  Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour when all these dramatic occurrences allegedly occur. Maybe this was some kind of cliche that had never been taxonomized before. Maybe I was on the trail of a new meme or something. Just when things were getting pretty interesting  things got really interesting. TED.com launched  later that year  with a bunch of videos from past talks  including mine  and I started receiving  four in the morning  citations from what seemed like every time zone on the planet. Much of it was content I never would have found on my own if I was looking for it  and I was not. I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes. I probably would have missed the booklet   Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning.  I do not subscribe to Crochet Today  magazine  although it looks delightful.  Laughter  Take note of those clock ends. This is a college student's suggestion for what a  four in the morning  gang sign should look like. People sent me magazine ads. They took photographs in grocery stores. I got a ton of graphic novels and comics. A lot of good quality work  too   The Sandman    Watchmen.  There's a very cute example here from  Calvin and Hobbes.  In fact  the oldest citation anybody sent in was from a cartoon from the Stone Age. Take a look. Fred Flintstone  Like at   a.m.  that's how early. Rives  And the flip side of the timeline  this is from the   st century. A thousand years from now  people are still doing this. Rives  It shows the spectrum. I received so many songs  TV shows  movies  like from dismal to famous  I could give you a four hour playlist. If I just stick to modern male movie stars  I keep it to the length of about a commercial. Here's your sampler. Rives  So somewhere along the line  I realized I have a hobby I didn't know I wanted  and it is crowdsourced. But I was also thinking what you might be thinking  which is really  couldn't you do this with any hour of the day  First of all  you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon. Secondly  I did a little research. You know  I was kind of interested. If this is confirmation bias  there is so much confirmation  I am biased. Literature probably shows it best. There are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare. There's a five in the morning. There are seven four in the mornings  and they're all very dire. In  Measure for Measure   it's the call time for the executioner. Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia at four in the morning right before battle in  War and Peace.  Charlotte Bront 's  Jane Eyre  has got kind of a pivotal four in the morning  as does Emily Bront 's  Wuthering Heights.   Lolita  has as a creepy four in the morning.  Huckleberry Finn  has one in dialect. Someone sent in H.G. Wells'  The Invisible Man.  Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's  Invisible Man.   The Great Gatsby  spends the last four in the morning of his life waiting for a lover who never shows  and the most famous wake up in literature  perhaps   The Metamorphosis.  First paragraph  the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach  but we already know  cockroach notwithstanding  something is up with this guy. Why  His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning. What kind of person would do that  This kind of person would do that. But of course  there is no news yet. Everyone's still asleep in their comfy  comfy beds. Rives  Exactly. So that's Lucy from the Peanuts   Mommie Dearest   Rocky  first day of training  Nelson Mandela  first day in office  and Bart Simpson  which combined with a cockroach would give you one hell of a dinner party and gives me yet another category  people waking up  in my big old database. Just imagine that your friends and your family have heard that you collect  say  stuffed polar bears  and they send them to you. Even if you don't really  at a certain point  you totally collect stuffed polar bears  and your collection is probably pretty kick ass. And when I got to that point  I embraced it. I got my curator on. I started fact checking  downloading  illegally screen grabbing. I started archiving. My hobby had become a habit  and my habit gave me possibly the world's most eclectic Netflix queue. At one point  it went   Guys and Dolls  The Musical    Last Tango in Paris    Diary of a Wimpy Kid    Porn Star  Legend of Ron Jeremy.  Why  Porn Star  Legend of Ron Jeremy   Because someone told me I would find this clip in there. in Flushing  Queens on March            at four o'clock in the morning. Rives  Of course he was.  Laughter   Applause  Yeah. Not only does it seem to make sense  it also answers the question   What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir have in common   Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography with the sentence   I was born at four o'clock in the morning   which I had because someone else had emailed it to me  and when they did  I had another bump up in my entry for this  because porn star Ron Jeremy and feminist Simone de Beauvoir are not just different people. They are different people that have this thing connecting them  and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge or inadvertent expertise  but I did wonder  is there maybe a cooler way to do this  So last October  in gentleman scholar tradition  I put the entire collection online as  Museum of Four in the Morning.  You can click on that red  refresh  button. It will take you at random to one of hundreds of snippets that are in the collection. Here is a knockout poem by Billy Collins called  Forgetfulness.  in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war. No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart. Rives  So the first hour of this project was satisfying. A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe. Half a globe away  a teenager made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me  a stranger. Less than a week later  though  I received a little bit of grace. I received a poignant tweet. It was brief. It just said   Reminds me of an ancient mix tape.  The name was a pseudonym  actually  or a pseudo pseudonym. As soon as I saw the initials  and the profile pic  I knew immediately  my whole body knew immediately who this was  and I knew immediately what mix tape she was talking about. L.D. was my college romance. This is in the early '  s. I was an undegrad. She was a grad student in the library sciences department. Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off  lets her hair down  suddenly she's smoking hot. She was already smoking hot  she was super dorky  and we had a December May romance  meaning we started dating in December  and by May  she had graduated and became my one that got away. But her mix tape did not get away. I have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards  not just from L.D.  from my life  but for decades. It's the kind of box where  if I have a girlfriend  I tend to hide it from her  and if I had a wife  I'm sure I would share it with her  but the story    Laughter    with this mix tape is there are seven songs per side  but no song titles. Instead  L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress classification system  including page numbers  to leave me clues. When I got this mix tape  I put it in my cassette player  I took it to the campus library  her library  I found    books on the shelves. I remember bringing them all to my favorite corner table  and I read poems paired to songs like food to wine  paired  I can tell you  like saddle shoes to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress. I did this again last October. I'm sitting there  I got new earbuds  old Walkman  I realize this is just the kind of extravagance I used to take for granted even when I was extravagant. And then I thought   Good for him.   PG  is Slavic literature.        series Polish literature. Z A   is a collection of    poems. Page    is Wislawa Szymborska's poem paired with Paul Simon's  Peace Like a River.    I woke up from out of my dream   Rives  Thank you. Appreciate it.  Applause  There's a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September        . On that day  a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials  a group of Afghan government officials  who would be meeting with some local village elders. The column came under ambush  and was surrounded on three sides  and amongst many other things  Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead. One of the people he rescued was a sergeant  and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter. And what was remarkable about this day is  by sheer coincidence  one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera. It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck. They put him in the helicopter  and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more. I saw this  and I thought to myself  where do people like that come from  What is that  That is some deep  deep emotion  when you would want to do that. There's a love there  and I wanted to know why is it that I don't have people that I work with like that  You know  in the military  they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain. In business  we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain. We have it backwards. Right  So I asked myself  where do people like this come from  And my initial conclusion was that they're just better people. That's why they're attracted to the military. These better people are attracted to this concept of service. But that's completely wrong. What I learned was that it's the environment  and if you get the environment right  every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things  and more importantly  others have that capacity too. I've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these  who we would call heroes  who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others  and I asked them   Why would you do it  Why did you do it   And they all say the same thing   Because they would have done it for me.  It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation. So trust and cooperation are really important here. The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings  they are not instructions. I can't simply say to you   Trust me   and you will. I can't simply instruct two people  to cooperate  and they will. It's not how it works. It's a feeling. So where does that feeling come from  If you go back        years to the Paleolithic era  to the early days of Homo sapiens  what we find is that the world was filled with danger  all of these forces working very  very hard to kill us. Nothing personal. Whether it was the weather  lack of resources  maybe a saber toothed tiger  all of these things working to reduce our lifespan. And so we evolved into social animals  where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety  inside the tribe  where we felt like we belonged. And when we felt safe amongst our own  the natural reaction was trust and cooperation. There are inherent benefits to this. It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger. If we don't trust each other  if I don't trust you  that means you won't watch for danger. Bad system of survival. The modern day is exactly the same thing. The world is filled with danger  things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success  reduce our opportunity for success. It could be the ups and downs in the economy  the uncertainty of the stock market. It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight. Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you. It's sometimes trying to put you out of business  but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you. We have no control over these forces. These are a constant  and they're not going away. The only variable are the conditions inside the organization  and that's where leadership matters  because it's the leader that sets the tone. When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first  to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results  so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong  remarkable things happen. I was flying on a trip  and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called  and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law  like a criminal. He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon. So I said something. I said   Why do you have treat us like cattle  Why can't you treat us like human beings   And this is exactly what she said to me. She said   Sir  if I don't follow the rules  I could get in trouble or lose my job.  All she was telling me is that she doesn't feel safe. All she was telling me is that she doesn't trust her leaders. The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people. It's because they don't fear their leaders. You see  if the conditions are wrong  we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other  and that inherently weakens the organization. When we feel safe inside the organization  we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities. The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is  is like being a parent. If you think about what being a great parent is  what do you want  What makes a great parent  We want to give our child opportunities  education  discipline them when necessary  all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves. Great leaders want exactly the same thing. They want to provide their people opportunity  education  discipline when necessary  build their self confidence  give them the opportunity to try and fail  all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves. Charlie Kim  who's the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City  a tech company  he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family  would you ever consider laying off one of your children  We would never do it. Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization  Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment. If you get a job at Next Jump  you cannot get fired for performance issues. In fact  if you have issues  they will coach you and they will give you support  just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school. It's the complete opposite. This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred  anger  at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures. It's not the numbers. It's that they have violated the very definition of leadership. They have violated this deep seated social contract. We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests  or worse  they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests. This is what so offends us  not the numbers. Would anybody be offended if we gave a      million bonus to Gandhi  How about a      million bonus to Mother Teresa  Do we have an issue with that  None at all. None at all. Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers. They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Bob Chapman  who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry Wehmiller  in      was hit very hard by the recession  and they lost    percent of their orders overnight. Now in a large manufacturing company  this is a big deal  and they could no longer afford their labor pool. They needed to save    million dollars  so  like so many companies today  the board got together and discussed layoffs. And Bob refused. You see  Bob doesn't believe in head counts. Bob believes in heart counts  and it's much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count. And so they came up with a furlough program. Every employee  from secretary to CEO  was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation. They could take it any time they wanted  and they did not have to take it consecutively. But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much. He said  it's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot  and morale went up. They saved    million dollars  and most importantly  as would be expected  when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization  the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate. And quite spontaneously  nobody expected  people started trading with each other. Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less. People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three. Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank. I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders. They are authorities  and we do what they say because they have authority over us  but we would not follow them. And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders  and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them  and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them. This is what a leader is. I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater  and as is the Marine custom  the officer ate last  and he let his men eat first  and when they were done  there was no food left for him. And when they went back out in the field  his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat  because that's what happens. We call them leaders because they go first. We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does. We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain  and when we do  the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us. They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader's vision comes to life  and when we ask them   Why would you do that  Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person   they all say the same thing   Because they would have done it for me.  And isn't that the organization we would all like to work in  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  You may be wondering why a marine biologist from Oceana would come here today to talk to you about world hunger. I'm here today because saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire. It's more than a thing we're doing because we want to create jobs for fishermen or preserve fishermen's jobs. It's more than an economic pursuit. Saving the oceans can feed the world. Let me show you how. As you know  there are already more than a billion hungry people on this planet. We're expecting that problem to get worse as world population grows to nine billion or    billion by midcentury  and we can expect to have greater pressure on our food resources. And this is a big concern  especially considering where we are now. Now we know that our arable land per capita is already on the decline in both developed and developing countries. We know that we're headed for climate change  which is going to change rainfall patterns  making some areas drier  as you can see in orange  and others wetter  in blue  causing droughts in our breadbaskets  in places like the Midwest and Central Europe  and floods in others. It's going to make it harder for the land to help us solve the hunger problem. And that's why the oceans need to be their most abundant  so that the oceans can provide us as much food as possible. And that's something the oceans have been doing for us for a long time. As far back as we can go  we've seen an increase in the amount of food we've been able to harvest from our oceans. It just seemed like it was continuing to increase  until about       when we started to see a decline. You've heard of peak oil. Maybe this is peak fish. I hope not. I'm going to come back to that. But you can see about an    percent decline in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch since     . And this is a big problem. It's continuing. This red line is continuing to go down. But we know how to turn it around  and that's what I'm going to talk about today. We know how to turn that curve back upwards. This doesn't have to be peak fish. If we do a few simple things in targeted places  we can bring our fisheries back and use them to feed people. First we want to know where the fish are  so let's look where the fish are. It turns out the fish  conveniently  are located for the most part in our coastal areas of the countries  in coastal zones  and these are areas that national jurisdictions have control over  and they can manage their fisheries in these coastal areas. Coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions that go out about     nautical miles  in areas that are called exclusive economic zones  and this is a good thing that they can control their fisheries in these areas  because the high seas  which are the darker areas on this map  the high seas  it's a lot harder to control things  because it has to be done internationally. You get into international agreements  and if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement  you know this can be a very slow  frustrating  tedious process. And so controlling things nationally is a great thing to be able to do. How many fish are actually in these coastal areas compared to the high seas  Well  you can see here about seven times as many fish in the coastal areas than there are in the high seas  so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing  because we can actually get a lot done. We can restore a lot of our fisheries if we focus in these coastal areas. But how many of these countries do we have to work in  There's something like    coastal countries. Do we have to fix fisheries management in all of those countries  So we asked ourselves  how many countries do we need to focus on  keeping in mind that the European Union conveniently manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy  So if we got good fisheries management in the European Union and  say  nine other countries  how much of our fisheries would we be covering  Turns out  European Union plus nine countries covers about two thirds of the world's fish catch. If we took it up to    countries plus the European Union  we would up to    percent  almost all of the world's fish catch. So we think we can work in a limited number of places to make the fisheries come back. But what do we have to do in these places  Well  based on our work in the United States and elsewhere  we know that there are three key things we have to do to bring fisheries back  and they are  We need to set quotas or limits on how much we take  we need to reduce bycatch  which is the accidental catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting  and it's very wasteful  and three  we need to protect habitats  the nursery areas  the spawning areas that these fish need to grow and reproduce successfully so that they can rebuild their populations. If we do those three things  we  know the fisheries will come back. How do we know  We know because we've seen it happening in a lot of different places. This is a slide that shows the herring population in Norway that was crashing since the     s. It was coming down  and when Norway set limits  or quotas  on its fishery  what happens  The fishery comes back. This is another example  also happens to be from Norway  of the Norwegian Arctic cod. Same deal. The fishery is crashing. They set limits on discards. Discards are these fish they weren't targeting and they get thrown overboard wastefully. When they set the discard limit  the fishery came back. And it's not just in Norway. We've seen this happening in countries all around the world  time and time again. When these countries step in and they put in sustainable fisheries management policies  the fisheries  which are always crashing  it seems  are starting to come back. So there's a lot of promise here. What does this mean for the world fish catch  This means that if we take that fishery catch that's on the decline and we could turn it upwards  we could increase it up to     million metric tons per year. So we didn't have peak fish yet. We still have an opportunity to not only bring the fish back but to actually get more fish that can feed more people than we currently are now. How many more  Right about now  we can feed about     million people a fish meal a day based on the current world fish catch  which  of course  you know is going down  so that number will go down over time if we don't fix it  but if we put fishery management practices like the ones I've described in place in    to    countries  we could bring that number up and feed as many as     million people a year a healthy fish meal. We should obviously do this just because it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem  but it's also cost effective. It turns out fish is the most cost effective protein on the planet. If you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all of the other animal proteins  obviously  fish is a good business decision. It also doesn't need a lot of land  something that's in short supply  compared to other protein sources. And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water. It uses a lot less fresh water than  for example  cattle  where you have to irrigate a field so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle. It also has a very low carbon footprint. It has a little bit of a carbon footprint because we do have to get out and catch the fish. It takes a little bit of fuel  but as you know  agriculture can have a carbon footprint  and fish has a much smaller one  so it's less polluting. It's already a big part of our diet  but it can be a bigger part of our diet  which is a good thing  because we know that it's healthy for us. It can reduce our risks of cancer  heart disease and obesity. In fact  our CEO Andy Sharpless  who is the originator of this concept  actually  he likes to say fish is the perfect protein. Andy also talks about the fact that our ocean conservation movement really grew out of the land conservation movement  and in land conservation  we have this problem where biodiversity is at war with food production. You have to cut down the biodiverse forest if you want to get the field to grow the corn to feed people with  and so there's a constant push pull there. There's a constant tough decision that has to be made between two very important things  maintaining biodiversity and feeding people. But in the oceans  we don't have that war. In the oceans  biodiversity is not at war with abundance. In fact  they're aligned. When we do things that produce biodiversity  we actually get more abundance  and that's important so that we can feed people. Now  there's a catch. Didn't anyone get that   Laughter  Illegal fishing. Illegal fishing undermines the type of sustainable fisheries management I'm talking about. It can be when you catch fish using gears that have been prohibited  when you fish in places where you're not supposed to fish  you catch fish that are the wrong size or the wrong species. Illegal fishing cheats the consumer and it also cheats honest fishermen  and it needs to stop. The way illegal fish get into our  market is through seafood fraud. You might have heard about this. It's when fish are labeled as something they're not. Think about the last time you had fish. What were you eating  Are you sure that's what it was  Because we tested       different fish samples and about a third of them were not what they were labeled to be. Snappers  nine out of    snappers were not snapper. Fifty nine percent of the tuna we tested was mislabeled. And red snapper  we tested     samples  and only seven of them were really red snapper  so good luck finding a red snapper. Seafood has a really complex supply chain  and at every step in this supply chain  there's an opportunity for seafood fraud  unless we have traceability. Traceability is a way where the seafood industry can track the seafood from the boat to the plate to make sure that the consumer can then find out where their seafood came from. This is a really important thing. It's being done by some in the industry  but not enough  so we're pushing a law in Congress called the SAFE Seafood Act  and I'm very excited today to announce the release of a chef's petition  where     chefs have signed a petition calling on Congress to support the SAFE Seafood Act. It has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know    Anthony Bourdain  Mario Batali  Barton Seaver and others   and they've signed it because they believe that people have a right to know about what they're eating. Fishermen like it too  so there's a good chance we can get the kind of support we need to get this bill through  and it comes at a critical time  because this is the way we stop seafood fraud  this is the way we curb illegal fishing  and this is the way we make sure that quotas  habitat protection  and bycatch reductions can do the jobs they can do. We know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably. We know that we can produce healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people that don't use the land  that don't use much water  have a low carbon footprint  and are cost effective. We know that saving the oceans can feed the world  and we need to start now. Thank you.  Applause  As a student of adversity  I've been struck over the years by how some people with major challenges seem to draw strength from them  and I've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning. And for a long time  I thought the meaning was out there  some great truth waiting to be found. But over time  I've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant. We call it finding meaning  but we might better call it forging meaning. My last book was about how families manage to deal with various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring  and one of the mothers I interviewed  who had two children with multiple severe disabilities  said to me   People always give us these little sayings like  'God doesn't give you any more than you can handle ' but children like ours are not preordained as a gift. They're a gift because that's what we have chosen.  We make those choices all our lives. When I was in second grade  Bobby Finkel had a birthday party and invited everyone in our class but me. My mother assumed there had been some sort of error  and she called Mrs. Finkel  who said that Bobby didn't like me and didn't want me at his party. And that day  my mom took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae. When I was in seventh grade  one of the kids on my school bus nicknamed me  Percy  as a shorthand for my demeanor  and sometimes  he and his cohort would chant that provocation the entire school bus ride     minutes up     minutes back   Percy  Percy  Percy  Percy   When I was in eighth grade  our science teacher told us that all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence because of the trauma to their anal sphincter. And I graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria  where I would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so  or sat with the boys and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls. I survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance. What I didn't know then  and do know now  is that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning. After you've forged meaning  you need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity. You need to take the traumas and make them part of who you've come to be  and you need to fold the worst events of your life into a narrative of triumph  evincing a better self in response to things that hurt. One of the other mothers I interviewed when I was working on my book had been raped as an adolescent  and had a child following that rape  which had thrown away her career plans and damaged all of her emotional relationships. But when I met her  she was     and I said to her   Do you often think about the man who raped you   And she said   I used to think about him with anger  but now only with pity.  And I thought she meant pity because he was so unevolved as to have done this terrible thing. And I said   Pity   And she said   Yes  because he has a beautiful daughter and two beautiful grandchildren and he doesn't know that  and I do. So as it turns out  I'm the lucky one.  Some of our struggles are things we're born to  our gender  our sexuality  our race  our disability. And some are things that happen to us  being a political prisoner  being a rape victim  being a Katrina survivor. Identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community  and to give strength there too. It involves substituting  and  for  but     not  I am here but I have cancer   but rather   I have cancer and I am here.  When we're ashamed  we can't tell our stories  and stories are the foundation of identity. Forge meaning  build identity  forge meaning and build identity. That became my mantra. Forging meaning is about changing yourself. Building identity is about changing the world. All of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily  how much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves  and how much to break the limits of what constitutes a valid life  Forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right. It only makes what was wrong precious. In January of this year  I went to Myanmar to interview political prisoners  and I was surprised to find them less bitter than I'd anticipated. Most of them had knowingly committed the offenses that landed them in prison  and they had walked in with their heads held high  and they walked out with their heads still held high  many years later. Dr. Ma Thida  a leading human rights activist who had nearly died in prison and had spent many years in solitary confinement  told me she was grateful to her jailers for the time she had had to think  for the wisdom she had gained  for the chance to hone her meditation skills. She had sought meaning and made her travail into a crucial identity. But if the people I met were less bitter than I'd anticipated about being in prison  they were also less thrilled than I'd expected about the reform process going on in their country. Ma Thida said   We Burmese are noted for our tremendous grace under pressure  but we also have grievance under glamour   she said   and the fact that there have been these shifts and changes doesn't erase the continuing problems in our society that we learned to see so well while we were in prison.  And I understood her to be saying that concessions confer only a little humanity  where full humanity is due  that crumbs are not the same as a place at the table  which is to say you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell. I've never been raped  and I've never been in anything remotely approaching a Burmese prison  but as a gay American  I've experienced prejudice and even hatred  and I've forged meaning and I've built identity  which is a move I learned from people who had experienced far worse privation than I've ever known. In my own adolescence  I went to extreme lengths to try to be straight. I enrolled myself in something called sexual surrogacy therapy  in which people I was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what I was encouraged to call exercises with women I was encouraged to call surrogates  who were not exactly prostitutes but who were also not exactly anything else. My particular favorite was a blonde woman from the Deep South who eventually admitted to me that she was really a necrophiliac and had taken this job after she got in trouble down at the morgue. These experiences eventually allowed me to have some happy physical relationships with women  for which I'm grateful  but I was at war with myself  and I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche. We don't seek the painful experiences that hew our identities  but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences. We cannot bear a pointless torment  but we can endure great pain if we believe that it's purposeful. Ease makes less of an impression on us than struggle. We could have been ourselves without our delights  but not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning.  Therefore  I take pleasure in infirmities   St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians   for when I am weak  then I am strong.  In       I went to Moscow to interview artists of the Soviet underground  and I expected their work to be dissident and political. But the radicalism in their work actually lay in reinserting humanity into a society that was annihilating humanity itself  as  in some senses  Russian society is now doing again. One of the artists I met said to me   We were in training to be not artists but angels.  In       I went back to see the artists I'd been writing about  and I was with them during the putsch that ended the Soviet Union  and they were among the chief organizers of the resistance to that putsch. And on the third day of the putsch  one of them suggested we walk up to Smolenskaya. And we went there  and we arranged ourselves in front of one of the barricades  and a little while later  a column of tanks rolled up  and the soldier on the front tank said   We have unconditional orders to destroy this barricade. If you get out of the way  we don't need to hurt you  but if you won't move  we'll have no choice but to run you down.  And the artists I was with said   Give us just a minute. Give us just a minute to tell you why we're here.  And the soldier folded his arms  and the artist launched into a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy such as those of us who live in a Jeffersonian democracy would be hard pressed to present. And they went on and on  and the soldier watched  and then he sat there for a full minute after they were finished and looked at us so bedraggled in the rain  and said   What you have said is true  and we must bow to the will of the people. If you'll clear enough space for us to turn around  we'll go back the way we came.  And that's what they did. Sometimes  forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need to fight for your ultimate freedom. Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion that oppression breeds the power to oppose it  and I gradually understood that as the cornerstone of identity. It took identity to rescue me from sadness. The gay rights movement posits a world in which my aberrances are a victory. Identity politics always works on two fronts  to give pride to people who have a given condition or characteristic  and to cause the outside world to treat such people more gently and more kindly. Those are two totally separate enterprises  but progress in each sphere reverberates in the other. Identity politics can be narcissistic. People extol a difference only because it's theirs. People narrow the world and function in discrete groups without empathy for one another. But properly understood and wisely practiced  identity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human. Identity itself should be not a smug label or a gold medal but a revolution. I would have had an easier life if I were straight  but I would not be me  and I now like being myself better than the idea of being someone else  someone who  to be honest  I have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine. But if you banish the dragons  you banish the heroes  and we become attached to the heroic strain in our own lives. I've sometimes wondered whether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay pride's technicolor fiesta  of which this speech is one manifestation. I used to think I would know myself to be mature when I could simply be gay without emphasis  but the self loathing of that period left a void  and celebration needs to fill and overflow it  and even if I repay my private debt of melancholy  there's still an outer world of homophobia that it will take decades to address. Someday  being gay will be a simple fact  free of party hats and blame  but not yet. A friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself  once suggested that we organize Gay Humility Week. It's a great idea  but its time has not yet come. And neutrality  which seems to lie halfway between despair and celebration  is actually the endgame. In    states in the U.S.  I could legally be fired or denied housing for being gay. In Russia  the anti propaganda law has led to people being beaten in the streets. Twenty seven African countries have passed laws against sodomy  and in Nigeria  gay people can legally be stoned to death  and lynchings have become common. In Saudi Arabia recently  two men who had been caught in carnal acts  were sentenced to       lashes each  and are now permanently disabled as a result. So who can forge meaning and build identity  Gay rights are not primarily marriage rights  and for the millions who live in unaccepting places with no resources  dignity remains elusive. I am lucky to have forged meaning and built identity  but that's still a rare privilege  and gay people deserve more collectively than the crumbs of justice. And yet  every step forward is so sweet. In       six years after we met  my partner and I decided to get married. Meeting John had been the discovery of great happiness and also the elimination of great unhappiness  and sometimes  I was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain that I forgot about the joy  which was at first the less remarkable part of it to me. Marrying was a way to declare our love as more a presence than an absence. Marriage soon led us to children  and that meant new meanings and new identities  ours and theirs. I want my children to be happy  and I love them most achingly when they are sad. As a gay father  I can teach them to own what is wrong in their lives  but I believe that if I succeed in sheltering them from adversity  I will have failed as a parent. A Buddhist scholar I know once explained to me that Westerners mistakenly think that nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you and you have only bliss to look forward to. But he said that would not be nirvana  because your bliss in the present would always be shadowed by the joy from the past. Nirvana  he said  is what you arrive at when you have only bliss to look forward to and find in what looked like sorrows the seedlings of your joy. And I sometimes wonder whether I could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children if they'd come more readily  if I'd been straight in my youth or were young now  in either of which cases this might be easier. Perhaps I could. Perhaps all the complex imagining I've done could have been applied to other topics. But if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning  the question is not whether I'd be happier for having been bullied  but whether assigning meaning to those experiences has made me a better father. I tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys  because I did not expect those joys to be ordinary to me. I know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families  but gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh  and gay families so exhilaratingly new  and I found meaning in that surprise. In October  it was my   th birthday  and my family organized a party for me  and in the middle of it  my son said to my husband that he wanted to make a speech  and John said   George  you can't make a speech. You're four.   Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I are going to make speeches tonight.  But George insisted and insisted  and finally  John took him up to the microphone  and George said very loudly   Ladies and gentlemen  may I have your attention please.  And everyone turned around  startled. And George said   I'm glad it's Daddy's birthday. I'm glad we all get cake. And daddy  if you were little  I'd be your friend.  And I thought   Thank you. I thought that I was indebted even to Bobby Finkel  because all those earlier experiences were what had propelled me to this moment  and I was finally unconditionally grateful for a life I'd once have done anything to change. The gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man what he could do to help the movement  and Harvey Milk said   Go out and tell someone.  There's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity  and there are always stories that restore it. If we live out loud  we can trounce the hatred and expand everyone's lives. Forge meaning. Build identity. Forge meaning. Build identity. And then invite the world to share your joy. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  What do augmented reality and professional football have to do with empathy  And what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow  Now unfortunately  I'm only going to answer one of those questions today  so please  try and contain your disappointment. When most people think about augmented reality  they think about  Minority Report  and Tom Cruise waving his hands in the air  but augmented reality is not science fiction. Augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime  and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen  and people need to be aware of that  because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone. Now how do we get to augmented reality  Step one is the step I'm wearing right now  Google Glass. I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass. What you may not be familiar with is that Google Glass is a device that will allow you to see what I see. It will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field. Right now  the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you. I have to use words. I have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination. With Google Glass  we can put that underneath a helmet  and we can get a sense of what it's like to be running down the field at     miles an hour  your blood pounding in your ears. You can get a sense of what it's like to have a     pound man sprinting at you trying to decapitate you with every ounce of his being. And I've been on the receiving end of that  and it doesn't feel very good. Now  I have some footage to show you of what it's like to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet to give you a taste of that. Unfortunately  it's not NFL practice footage because the NFL thinks emergent technology is what happens when a submarine surfaces  but    Laughter    we do what we can. So let's pull up some video. Ugh  getting tackled sucks. Hold on  let's get a little closer. All right  ready  Go  Chris Kluwe  So as you can see  small taste of what it's like to get tackled on the football field from the perspective of the tacklee. Now  you may have noticed there are some people missing there  the rest of the team. We have some video of that courtesy of the University of Washington. Blue    Blue    Go  Oh  CK  So again  this takes you a little bit closer to what it's like to be on that field  but this is nowhere what it's like to be on the NFL. Fans want that experience. Fans want to be on that field. They want to be their favorite players  and they've already talked to me on YouTube  they've talked to me on Twitter  saying   Hey  can you get this on a quarterback  Can you get this on a running back  We want that experience.  Well  once we have that experience with GoPro and Google Glass  how do we make it more immersive  How do we take that next step  Well  we take that step by going to something called the Oculus Rift  which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with. The Oculus Rift has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created  and that is not empty hype. I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype with this video. No  No  No  I don't want to play anymore  No  Oh my God  Aaaah  CK  So that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in fear of his life. What do you think that fan's experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line  shedding a tackler with a stiff arm before sprinting in for a touchdown  What do you think that fan's experience is going to be when he's Messi sprinting down the pitch putting the ball in the back of the net  or Federer serving in Wimbledon  What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over    miles an hour as an Olympic downhill skier  I think adult diaper sales may surge. But this is not yet augmented reality. This is only virtual reality  V.R. How do we get to augmented reality  A.R.  We get to augmented reality when coaches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see  and they say   How do we use this to make our teams better  How do we use this to win games   Because teams always use technology to win games. They like winning. It makes them money. So a brief history of technology in the NFL. In       the Baltimore Colts put a wristband on their quarterback to allow him to call plays quicker. They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year. Other teams followed suit. More people watched the game because it was more exciting. It was faster. In       the NFL put helmet radios into the helmets of the quarterbacks  and later the defense. More people watched games because it was faster. It was more entertaining. In       imagine you're a player walking back to the huddle  and you have your next play displayed right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor that you already wear right now. No more having to worry about forgetting plays. No more worrying about having to memorize your playbook. You just go out and react. And coaches really want this  because missed assignments lose you games  and coaches hate losing games. Losing games gets you fired as a coach. They don't want that. But augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook. Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game. What would that be like  Well  a very simple setup would be a camera on each corner of the stadium looking down  giving you a bird's eye view of all the people down there. You also have information from helmet sensors and accelerometers  technology that's being worked on right now. You take all that information  and you stream it to your players. The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use. The bad ones have information overload. That determines good teams from bad. And now  your I.T. department is just as important as your scouting department  and data mining is not for nerds anymore. It's also for jocks. Who knew  What would that look like on the field  Well  imagine you're the quarterback. You take the snap and you drop back. You're scanning downfield for an open receiver. All of a sudden  a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know  blind side linebacker is blitzing in. Normally  you wouldn't be able to see him  but the augmented reality system lets you know. You step up into the pocket. Another flash alerts you to an open receiver. You throw the ball  but you're hit right as you throw. The ball comes off track. You don't know where it's going to land. However  on the receiver's visor  he sees a patch of grass light up  and he knows to readjust. He goes  catches the ball  sprints in  touchdown. Crowd goes wild  and the fans are with him every step of the way  watching from every perspective. Now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game. It will make tons of people watch  because people want this experience. Fans want to be on the field. They want to be their favorite player. Augmented reality will be a part of sports  because it's too profitable not to. But the question I ask you is  is that's all that we're content to use augmented reality for  Are we going to use it solely for our panem  our circenses  our entertainment as normal  Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more. I believe we can use augmented reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself  by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person's shoes. We know what this technology is worth to sports leagues. It's worth revenue  to the tune of billions of dollars a year. But what is this technology worth to a teacher in a classroom trying to show a bully just how harmful his actions are from the perspective of the victim  What is this technology worth to a gay Ugandan or Russian trying to show the world what it's like living under persecution  What is this technology worth to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians  Ladies and gentlemen  augmented reality is coming. The questions we ask  the choices we make  and the challenges we face are  as always  up to us. Thank you. I'm excited to be here to speak about vets  because I didn't join the Army because I wanted to go to war. I didn't join the Army because I had a lust or a need to go overseas and fight. Frankly  I joined the Army because college is really damn expensive  and they were going to help with that  and I joined the Army because it was what I knew  and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well. I didn't come from a military family. I'm not a military brat. No one in my family ever had joined the military at all  and how I first got introduced to the military was when I was    years old and I got sent away to military school  because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since I was eight years old. I had some issues when I was coming up  and my mother would always tell me  she's like   You know  if you don't get this together  I'm going to send you to military school.  And I'd look at her  and I'd say   Mommy  I'll work harder.  And then when I was nine years old  she started giving me brochures to show me she wasn't playing around  so I'd look at the brochures  and I'm like   Okay  Mommy  I can see you're serious  and I'll work harder.  And then when I was    and     my behavior just kept on getting worse. I was on academic and disciplinary probation before I hit double digits  and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists when I was    years old. And so when I was    years old  my mother came up to me  and she was like   I'm not going to do this anymore. I'm going to send you to military school.  And I looked at her  and I said   Mommy  I can see you're upset  and I'm going to work harder.  And she was like   No  you're going next week.  And that was how I first got introduced to this whole idea of the military  because she thought this was a good idea. I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly when I first showed up there  because literally in the first four days  I had already run away five times from this school. They had these big black gates that surrounded the school  and every time they would turn their backs  I would just simply run out of the black gates and take them up on their offer that if we don't want to be there  we can leave at any time. So I just said   Well  if that's the case  then I'd like to leave.   Laughter  And it never worked. And I kept on getting lost. But then eventually  after staying there for a little while  and after the end of that first year at this military school  I realized that I actually was growing up. I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure was something that I'd never found before  the fact that I finally felt like I was part of something bigger  part of a team  and it actually mattered to people that I was there  the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there  but that it was a real  actually core part of the entire experience. And so when it was time for me to actually finish up high school  I started thinking about what I wanted to do  and just like probably most students  had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do. And I thought about the people who I respected and admired. I thought about a lot of the people  in particular a lot of the men  in my life who I looked up to. They all happened to wear the uniform of the United States of America  so for me  the question and the answer really became pretty easy. The question of what I wanted to do was filled in very quickly with saying  I guess I'll be an Army officer. So the Army then went through this process and they trained me up  and when I say I didn't join the Army because I wanted to go to war  the truth is  I joined in     . There really wasn't a whole lot going on. I didn't ever feel like I was in danger. When I went to my mom  I first joined the Army when I was    years old  so I literally needed parental permission to join the Army  so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom  and she just assumed it was kind of like military school. She was like   Well  it was good for him before  so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it   having no idea that the paperwork that she was signing was actually signing her son up to become an Army officer. And I went through the process  and again the whole time still just thinking  this is great  maybe I'll serve on a weekend  or two weeks during the year  do drill  and then a couple years after I signed up  a couple years after my mother signed those papers  the whole world changed. And after       there was an entirely new context about the occupation that I chose. When I first joined  I never joined to fight  but now that I was in  this is exactly what was now going to happen. And I thought about so much about the soldiers who I eventually had to end up leading. I remember when we first  right after       three weeks after       I was on a plane heading overseas  but I wasn't heading overseas with the military  I was heading overseas because I got a scholarship to go overseas. I received the scholarship to go overseas and to go study and live overseas  and I was living in England and that was interesting  but at the same time  the same people who I was training with  the same soldiers that I went through all my training with  and we prepared for war  they were now actually heading over to it. They were now about to find themselves in the middle of places the fact is the vast majority of people  the vast majority of us as we were training  couldn't even point out on a map. I spent a couple years finishing graduate school  and the whole entire time while I'm sitting there in buildings at Oxford that were literally built hundreds of years before the United States was even founded  and I'm sitting there talking to dons about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand  and how that influenced the start of World War I  where the entire time my heart and my head were on my soldiers who were now throwing on Kevlars and grabbing their flak vests and figuring out how exactly do I change around or how exactly do I clean a machine gun in the darkness. That was the new reality. By the time I finished that up and I rejoined my military unit and we were getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan  there were soldiers in my unit who were now on their second and third deployments before I even had my first. I remember walking out with my unit for the first time  and when you join the Army and you go through a combat tour  everyone looks at your shoulder  because on your shoulder is your combat patch. And so immediately as you meet people  you shake their hand  and then your eyes go to their shoulder  because you want to see where did they serve  or what unit did they serve with  And I was the only person walking around with a bare shoulder  and it burned every time someone stared at it. But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers  and you ask them why did they sign up. I signed up because college was expensive. A lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons. They signed up because of a sense of obligation. They signed up because they were angry and they wanted to do something about it. They signed up because their family said this was important. They signed up because they wanted some form of revenge. They signed for a whole collection of different reasons. And now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts. And what was amazing to me was that I very naively started hearing this statement that I never fully understood  because right after       you start hearing this idea where people come up to you and they say   Well  thank you for your service.  And I just kind of followed in and started saying the same things to all my soldiers. This is even before I deployed. But I really had no idea what that even meant. I just said it because it sounded right. I said it because it sounded like the right thing to say to people who had served overseas.  Thank you for your service.  But I had no idea what the context was or what that even  what it even meant to the people who heard it. When I first came back from Afghanistan  I thought that if you make it back from conflict  then the dangers were all over. I thought that if you made it back from a conflict zone that somehow you could kind of wipe the sweat off your brow and say   Whew  I'm glad I dodged that one   without understanding that for so many people  as they come back home  the war keeps going. It keeps playing out in all of our minds. It plays out in all of our memories. It plays out in all of our emotions. Please forgive us if we don't like being in big crowds. Please forgive us when we spend one week in a place that has     percent light discipline  because you're not allowed to walk around with white lights  because if anything has a white light  it can be seen from miles away  versus if you use little green or little blue lights  they cannot be seen from far away. So please forgive us if out of nowhere  we go from having     percent light discipline to then a week later being back in the middle of Times Square  and we have a difficult time adjusting to that. Please forgive us when you transition back to a family who has completely been maneuvering without you  and now when you come back  it's not that easy to fall back into a sense of normality  because the whole normal has changed. I remember when I came back  I wanted to talk to people. I wanted people to ask me about my experiences. I wanted people to come up to me and tell me   What did you do   I wanted people to come up to me and tell me   What was it like  What was the food like  What was the experience like  How are you doing   And the only questions I got from people was   Did you shoot anybody   And those were the ones who were even curious enough to say anything. Because sometimes there's this fear and there's this apprehension that if I say anything  I'm afraid I'll offend  or I'm afraid I'll trigger something  so the common default is just saying nothing. The problem with that is then it feels like your service was not even acknowledged  like no one even cared.  Thank you for your service   and we move on. What I wanted to better understand was what's behind that  and why  thank you for your service  isn't enough. The fact is  we have literally  .  million men and women who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan who are all amongst us. Sometimes we know who they are  sometimes we don't  but there is that feeling  the shared experience  the shared bond where we know that that experience and that chapter of our life  while it might be closed  it's still not over. We think about  thank you for your service   and people say   So what does 'thank you for your service' mean to you   Well   Thank you for your service  means to me  it means acknowledging our stories  asking us who we are  understanding the strength that so many people  so many people who we serve with  have  and why that service means so much.  Thank you for your service  means acknowledging the fact that just because we've now come home and we've taken off the uniform does not mean our larger service to this country is somehow over. The fact is  there's still a tremendous amount that can be offered and can be given. When I look at people like our friend Taylor Urruela  who in Iraq loses his leg  had two big dreams in his life. One was to be a soldier. The other was to be a baseball player. He loses his leg in Iraq. He comes back and instead of deciding that  well  now since I've lost my leg  that second dream is over  he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball  and he starts this group called VETSports  which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing. People like Tammy Duckworth  who was a helicopter pilot and with the helicopter that she was flying  you need to use both your hands and also your legs to steer  and her helicopter gets hit  and she's trying to steer the chopper  but the chopper's not reacting to her instructions and to her commands. She's trying to land the chopper safely  but the chopper doesn't land safely  and the reason it's not landing safely is because it's not responding to the commands that her legs are giving because her legs were blown off. She barely survives. Medics come and they save her life  but then as she's doing her recuperation back at home  she realizes that   My job's still not done.  And now she uses her voice as a Congresswoman from Illinois to fight and advocate for a collection of issues to include veterans issues. We signed up because we love this country we represent. We signed up because we believe in the idea and we believe in the people to our left and to our right. And the only thing we then ask is that  thank you for your service  needs to be more than just a quote break  that  thank you for your service  means honestly digging in to the people who have stepped up simply because they were asked to  and what that means for us not just now  not just during combat operations  but long after the last vehicle has left and after the last shot has been taken. These are the people who I served with  and these are the people who I honor. So thank you for your service. I'm going to ask and try to answer  in some ways  kind of an uncomfortable question. Both civilians  obviously  and soldiers suffer in war  I don't think any civilian has ever missed the war that they were subjected to. I've been covering wars for almost    years  and one of the remarkable things for me is how many soldiers find themselves missing it. How is it someone can go through the worst experience imaginable  and come home  back to their home  and their family  their country  and miss the war  How does that work  What does it mean  We have to answer that question  because if we don't  it'll be impossible to bring soldiers back to a place in society where they belong  and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war  if we don't understand how that mechanism works. The problem is that war does not have a simple  neat truth  one simple  neat truth. Any sane person hates war  hates the idea of war  wouldn't want to have anything to do with it  doesn't want to be near it  doesn't want to know about it. That's a sane response to war. But if I asked all of you in this room  who here has paid money to go to a cinema and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie  most of you would probably raise your hands. That's what's so complicated about war. And trust me  if a room full of peace loving people finds something compelling about war  so do    year old soldiers who have been trained in it  I promise you. That's the thing that has to be understood. I've covered war for about    years  as I said  but my most intense experiences in combat were with American soldiers in Afghanistan. I've been in Africa  the Middle East  Afghanistan in the '  s  but it was with American soldiers in             that I was confronted with very intense combat. I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley in eastern Afghanistan. It was six miles long. There were     men of Battle Company in that valley  and for a while  while I was there  almost    percent of all the combat in all of Afghanistan was happening in those six miles. A hundred and fifty men were absorbing almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces in the country  for a couple months. It was very intense. I spent most of my time at a small outpost called Restrepo. It was named after the platoon medic that had been killed about two months into the deployment. It was a few plywood B huts clinging to a side of a ridge  and sandbags  bunkers  gun positions  and there were    men up there of Second Platoon  Battle Company. I spent most of my time up there. There was no running water. There was no way to bathe. The guys were up there for a month at a time. They never even got out of their clothes. They fought. The worked. They slept in the same clothes. They never took them off  and at the end of the month  they went back down to the company headquarters  and by then  their clothes were unwearable. They burned them and got a new set. There was no Internet. There was no phone. There was no communication with the outside world up there. There was no cooked food. There was nothing up there that young men typically like  no cars  no girls  no television  nothing except combat. Combat they did learn to like. I remember one day  it was a very hot day in the spring  and we hadn't been in a fight in a couple of weeks  maybe. Usually  the outpost was attacked  and we hadn't seen any combat in a couple of weeks  and everyone was just stunned with boredom and heat. And I remember the lieutenant walking past me sort of stripped to the waist. It was incredibly hot. Stripped to the waist  walked past me muttering   Oh God  please someone attack us today.  That's how bored they were. That's war too  is a lieutenant saying   Please make something happen because we're going crazy.  To understand that  you have to  for a moment  think about combat not morally    that's an important job to do   but for a moment  don't think about it morally  think about it neurologically. Let's think about what happens in your brain when you're in combat. First of all  the experience is very bizarre  it's a very bizarre one. It's not what I had expected. Usually  you're not scared. I've been very scared in combat  but most of the time when I was out there  I wasn't scared. I was very scared beforehand and incredibly scared afterwards  and that fear that comes afterwards can last years. I haven't been shot at in six years  and I was woken up very abruptly this morning by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft  six years later. I've never even been strafed by aircraft  and I was having nightmares about it. Time slows down. You get this weird tunnel vision. You notice some details very  very  very accurately and other things drop out. It's almost a slightly altered state of mind. What's happening in your brain is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline pumped through your system. Young men will go to great lengths to have that experience. It's wired into us. It's hormonally supported. The mortality rate for young men in society is six times what it is for young women from violence and from accidents  just the stupid stuff that young men do  jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of  lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire  I mean  you know what I'm talking about. They die at six times the rate that young women do. Statistically  you are safer as a teenage boy  you would be safer in the fire department or the police department in most American cities than just walking around the streets of your hometown looking for something to do  statistically. You can imagine how that plays out in combat. At Restrepo  every guy up there was almost killed  including me  including my good friend Tim Hetherington  who was later killed in Libya. There were guys walking around with bullet holes in their uniforms  rounds that had cut through the fabric and didn't touch their bodies. I was leaning against some sandbags one morning  not much going on  sort of spacing out  and some sand was kicked into the side of  sort of hit the side of my face. Something hit the side of my face  and I didn't know what it was. You have to understand about bullets that they go a lot faster than sound  so if someone shoots at you from a few hundred meters  the bullet goes by you  or hits you obviously  half a second or so before the sound catches up to it. So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face. Half a second later  I heard dut dut dut dut duh. It was machine gun fire. It was the first round  the first burst of an hour long firefight. What had happened was the bullet hit  a bullet hit three or four inches from the side of my head. Imagine  just think about it  because I certainly did  think about the angle of deviation that saved my life. At     meters  it missed me by three inches. Just think about the math on that. Every guy up there had some experience like that  at least once  if not many times. The boys are up there for a year. They got back. Some of them got out of the Army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home. Some of them stayed in the Army and were more or less okay  psychologically. I was particularly close to a guy named Brendan O'Byrne. I'm still very good friends with him. He came back to the States. He got out of the Army. I had a dinner party one night. I invited him  and he started talking with a woman  one of my friends  and she knew how bad it had been out there  and she said   Brendan  is there anything at all that you miss about being out in Afghanistan  about the war   And he thought about it quite a long time  and finally he said   Ma'am  I miss almost all of it.  And he's one of the most traumatized people I've seen from that war.  Ma'am  I miss almost all of it.  What is he talking about  He's not a psychopath. He doesn't miss killing people. He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at and seeing his friends get killed. What is it that he misses  We have to answer that. If we're going to stop war  we have to answer that question. I think what he missed is brotherhood. He missed  in some ways  the opposite of killing. What he missed was connection to the other men he was with. Now  brotherhood is different from friendship. Friendship happens in society  obviously. The more you like someone  the more you'd be willing to do for them. Brotherhood has nothing to do with how you feel about the other person. It's a mutual agreement in a group that you will put the welfare of the group  you will put the safety of everyone in the group above your own. In effect  you're saying   I love these other people more than I love myself.  Brendan was a team leader in command of three men  and the worst day in Afghanistan   He was almost killed so many times. It didn't bother him. The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet in the helmet  knocked him over. They thought he was dead. It was in the middle of a huge firefight. No one could deal with it  and a minute later  Kyle Steiner sat back up from the dead  as it were  because he'd come back to consciousness. The bullet had just knocked him out. It glanced off the helmet. He remembers people saying  as he was sort of half conscious  he remembers people saying   Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead.  And he was thinking   I'm not dead.  And he sat up. And Brendan realized after that that he could not protect his men  and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan  was realizing that. That's brotherhood. This wasn't invented recently. Many of you have probably read  The Iliad.  Achilles surely would have risked his life or given his life to save his friend Patroclus. In World War II  there were many stories of soldiers who were wounded  were brought to a rear base hospital  who went AWOL  crawled out of windows  slipped out doors  went AWOL  wounded  to make their way back to the front lines to rejoin their brothers out there. So you think about Brendan  you think about all these soldiers having an experience like that  a bond like that  in a small group  where they loved    other people in some ways more than they loved themselves  you think about how good that would feel  imagine it  and they are blessed with that experience for a year  and then they come home  and they are just back in society like the rest of us are  not knowing who they can count on  not knowing who loves them  who they can love  not knowing exactly what anyone they know would do for them if it came down to it. That is terrifying. Compared to that  war  psychologically  in some ways  is easy  compared to that kind of alienation. That's why they miss it  and that's what we have to understand and in some ways fix in our society. Thank you very much. So it was the fall of       and President Theodore Roosevelt needed a little break from the White House  so he took a train to Mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called Smedes. The first day of the hunt  they didn't see a single bear  so it was a big bummer for everyone  but the second day  the dogs cornered one after a really long chase  but by that point  the president had given up and gone back to camp for lunch  so his hunting guide cracked the animal on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle  and then tied it up to a tree and started tooting away on his bugle to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor of shooting it. The bear was a female. It was dazed  injured  severely underweight  a little mangy looking  and when Roosevelt saw this animal tied up to the tree  he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it. He felt like that would go against his code as a sportsman. A few days later  the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in Washington. It was called  Drawing a Line in Mississippi   and it showed Roosevelt with his gun down and his arm out  sparing the bear's life  and the bear was sitting on its hind legs with these two big  frightened  wide eyes and little ears pricked up at the top of its head. It looked really helpless  like you just wanted to sweep it up into your arms and reassure it. It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time  but if you go looking for the cartoon now  you recognize the animal right away  It's a teddy bear. And this is how the teddy bear was born. Essentially  toymakers took the bear from the cartoon  turned it into a plush toy  and then named it after President Roosevelt    Teddy's bear. And I do feel a little ridiculous that I'm up here on this stage and I'm choosing to use my time to tell you about a     year old story about the invention of a squishy kid's toy  but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear  inside that story is a more important story  a story about how dramatically our ideas about nature can change  and also about how  on the planet right now  the stories that we tell are dramatically changing nature. Because think about the teddy bear. For us  in retrospect  it feels like an obvious fit  because bears are so cute and cuddly  and who wouldn't want to give one to their kids to play with  but the truth is that in       bears weren't cute and cuddly. I mean  they looked the same  but no one thought of them that way. In       bears were monsters. Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids. For generations at that point  the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger that people were encountering on the frontier  and the federal government was actually systematically exterminating bears and lots of other predators too  like coyotes and wolves. These animals  they were being demonized. They were called murderers because they killed people's livestock. One government biologist  he explained this war on animals like the bear by saying that they no longer had a place in our advancing civilization  and so we were just clearing them out of the way. In one    year period  close to half a million wolves had been slaughtered. The grizzly would soon be wiped out from    percent of its original territory  and whereas once there had been    million bison moving across the plains  and you would have these stories of trains having to stop for four or five hours so that these thick  living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks  now  by       there were maybe  less than     left in the wild. And so what I'm saying is  the teddy bear was born into the middle of this great spasm of extermination  and you can see it as a sign that maybe some people deep down were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing. America still hated the bear and feared it  but all of a sudden  America also wanted to give the bear a great big hug. So this is something that I've been really curious about in the last few years. How do we imagine animals  how do we think and feel about them  and how do their reputations get written and then rewritten in our minds  We're here living in the eye of a great storm of extinction where half the species on the planet could be gone by the end of the century  and so why is it that we come to care about some of those species and not others  Well  there's a new field  a relatively new field of social science that started looking at these questions and trying to unpack the powerful and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships that we have to animals  and I spent a lot of time looking through their academic journals  and all I can really say is that their findings are astonishingly wide ranging. So some of my favorites include that the more television a person watches in Upstate New York  the more he or she is afraid of being attacked by a black bear. If you show a tiger to an American  they're much more likely to assume that it's female and not male. In a study where a fake snake and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road  drivers hit the snake much more often than the turtle  and about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals seemed to do it on purpose. Women are more likely than men to get a  magical feeling  when they see dolphins in the surf. Sixty eight percent of mothers with  high feelings of entitlement and self esteem  identified with the dancing cats in a commercial for Purina.  Laughter  Americans consider lobsters more important than pigeons but also much  much stupider. Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea otters  and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs. So some of this is physical  right  We tend to sympathize more with animals that look like us  and especially that resemble human babies  so with big  forward facing eyes and circular faces  kind of a roly poly posture. This is why  if you get a Christmas card from  like  your great aunt in Minnesota  there's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it  and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider. But it's not all physical  right  There's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals  and we're telling stories about these animals  and like all stories  they are shaped by the times and the places in which we're telling them. So think about that moment back in      again where a ferocious bear became a teddy bear. What was the context  Well  America was urbanizing. For the first time  nearly a majority of people lived in cities  so there was a growing distance between us and nature. There was a safe space where we could reconsider the bear and romanticize it. Nature could only start to seem this pure and adorable because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore. And you can see that cycle playing out again and again with all kinds of animals. It seems like we're always stuck between demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out  and then when we get very close to doing that  empathizing with it as an underdog and wanting to show it compassion. So we exert our power  but then we're unsettled by how powerful we are. So for example  this is one of probably thousands of letters and drawings that kids sent to the Bush administration  begging it to protect the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act  and these were sent back in the mid     s  when awareness of climate change was suddenly surging. We kept seeing that image of a polar bear stranded on a little ice floe looking really morose. I spent days looking through these files. I really love them. This one's my favorite. If you can see  it's a polar bear that's drowning and then it's also being eaten simultaneously by a lobster and a shark. This one came from a kid named Fritz  and he's actually got a solution to climate change. He's got it all worked out to an ethanol based solution. He says   I feel bad about the polar bears. I like polar bears. Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz.  So     years ago  you would have Arctic explorers writing about polar bears leaping into their boats and trying to devour them  even if they lit the bear on fire  but these kids don't see the polar bear that way  and actually they don't even see the polar bear the way that I did back in the '  s. I mean  we thought of these animals as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic. But look now how quickly that climate change has flipped the image of the animal in our minds. It's gone from that bloodthirsty man killer to this delicate  drowning victim  and when you think about it  that's kind of the conclusion to the story that the teddy bear started telling back in       because back then  America had more or less conquered its share of the continent. We were just getting around to polishing off these last wild predators. Now  society's reach has expanded all the way to the top of the world  and it's made even these  the most remote  the most powerful bears on the planet  seem like adorable and blameless victims. But you know  there's also a postscript to the teddy bear story that not a lot of people talk about. We're going to talk about it  because even though it didn't really take long after Roosevelt's hunt in      for the toy to become a full blown craze  most people figured it was a fad  it was a sort of silly political novelty item and it would go away once the president left office  and so by       when Roosevelt's successor  William Howard Taft  was getting ready to be inaugurated  the toy industry was on the hunt for the next big thing. They didn't do too well. That January  Taft was the guest of honor at a banquet in Atlanta  and for days in advance  the big news was the menu. They were going to be serving him a Southern specialty  a delicacy  really  called possum and taters. So you would have a whole opossum roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes  and then sometimes they'd leave the big tail on it like a big  meaty noodle. The one brought to Taft's table weighed    pounds. So after dinner  the orchestra started to play  and the guests burst into song  and all of a sudden  Taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from a group of local supporters  and this was a stuffed opossum toy  all beady eyed and bald eared  and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the William Taft presidency's answer to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear. They were calling it the  billy possum.  Within    hours  the Georgia Billy Possum Company was up and running  brokering deals for these things nationwide  and the Los Angeles Times announced  very confidently   The teddy bear has been relegated to a seat in the rear  and for four years  possibly eight  the children of the United States will play with billy possum.  So from that point  there was a fit of opossum fever. There were billy possum postcards  billy possum pins  billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time. There were smaller billy possums on a stick that kids could wave around like flags. But even with all this marketing  the life of the billy possum turned out to be just pathetically brief. The toy was an absolute flop  and it was almost completely forgotten by the end of the year  and what that means is that the billy possum didn't even make it to Christmastime  which when you think about it is a special sort of tragedy for a toy. So we can explain that failure two ways. The first  well  it's pretty obvious. I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway  Opossums are hideous.  Laughter  But maybe more importantly is that the story of the billy possum was all wrong  especially compared to the backstory of the teddy bear. Think about it  for most of human's evolutionary history  what's made bears impressive to us has been their complete independence from us. It's that they live these parallel lives as menaces and competitors. By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi  that stature was being crushed  and the animal that he had roped to a tree really was a symbol for all bears. Whether those animals lived or died now was entirely up to the compassion or the indifference of people. That said something really ominous about the future of bears  but it also said something very  unsettling about who we'd become  if the survival of even an animal like that was up to us now. So now  a century later  if you're at all paying attention to what's happening in the environment  you feel that discomfort so much more intensely. We're living now in an age of what scientists have started to call  conservation reliance   and what that term means is that we've disrupted so much that nature can't possibly stand on its own anymore  and most endangered species are only going to survive if we stay out there in the landscape riggging the world around them in their favor. So we've gone hands on and we can't ever take our hands off  and that's a hell of a lot of work. Right now  we're training condors not to perch on power lines. We teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter behind little ultra light airplanes. We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets. We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones. So we've gone from annihilating species to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species indefinitely  and which ones  Well  the ones that we've told compelling stories about  the ones we've decided ought to stick around. The line between conservation and domestication is blurred. So what I've been saying is that the stories that we tell about wild animals are so subjective they can be irrational or romanticized or sensationalized. Sometimes they just have nothing to do with the facts. But in a world of conservation reliance  those stories have very real consequences  because now  how we feel about an animal affects its survival more than anything that you read about in ecology textbooks. Storytelling matters now. Emotion matters. Our imagination has become an ecological force. And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part because the legend of Roosevelt and that bear in Mississippi was kind of like an allegory of this great responsibility that society was just beginning to face up to back then. It would be another    years before the Endangered Species Act was passed  but really  here's its whole ethos boiled down into something like a scene you'd see in a stained glass window. The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree  and the president of the United States decided to show it some mercy. Thank you.  Illustrations by Wendy MacNaughton  As a little girl  I always imagined I would one day run away. From the age of six on  I kept a packed bag with some clothes and cans of food tucked away in the back of a closet. There was a deep restlessness in me  a primal fear that I would fall prey to a life of routine and boredom. And so  many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where I would walk across borders  forage for berries  and meet all kinds of strange people living unconventional lives on the road. Years have passed  but many of the adventures I fantasized about as a child    traveling and weaving my way between worlds other than my own   have become realities through my work as a documentary photographer. But no other experience has felt as true to my childhood dreams as living amongst and documenting the lives of fellow wanderers across the United States. This is the nomadic dream  a different kind of American dream lived by young hobos  travelers  hitchhikers  vagrants and tramps. In most of our minds  the vagabond is a creature from the past. The word  hobo  conjures up an old black and white image of a weathered old man covered in coal  legs dangling out of a boxcar  but these photographs are in color  and they portray a community swirling across the country  fiercely alive and creatively free  seeing sides of America that no one else gets to see. Like their predecessors  today's nomads travel the steel and asphalt arteries of the United States. By day  they hop freight trains  stick out their thumbs  and ride the highways with anyone from truckers to soccer moms. By night  they sleep beneath the stars  huddled together with their packs of dogs  cats and pet rats between their bodies. Some travelers take to the road by choice  renouncing materialism  traditional jobs and university degrees in exchange  for a glimmer of adventure. Others come from the underbelly of society  never given a chance to mobilize upwards  foster care dropouts  teenage runaways escaping abuse and unforgiving homes. Where others see stories of privation and economic failure  travelers view their own existence through the prism of liberation and freedom. They'd rather live off of the excess of what they view as a wasteful consumer society than slave away at an unrealistic chance at the traditional American dream. They take advantage of the fact that in the United States  up to    percent of all food ends up in the garbage by scavenging for perfectly good produce in dumpsters and trash cans. They sacrifice material comforts in exchange for the space and the time to explore a creative interior  to dream  to read  to work on music  art and writing. But there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic. No one loses their inner demons by taking to the road. Addiction is real  the elements are real  freight trains maim and kill  and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest to the exhaustive list of laws that criminalize homeless existence. Who here knows that in many cities across the United States it is now illegal to sit on the sidewalk  to wrap oneself in a blanket  to sleep in your own car  to offer food to a stranger  I know about these laws because I've watched as friends and other travelers were hauled off to jail or received citations for committing these so called crimes. Many of you might be wondering why anyone would choose a life like this  under the thumb of discriminatory laws  eating out of trash cans  sleeping under bridges  picking up seasonal jobs here and there. The answer to such a question is as varied as the people that take to the road  but travelers often respond with a single word  freedom. Until we live in a society where every human is assured dignity in their labor so that they can work to live well  not only work to survive  there will always be an element of those who seek the open road as a means of escape  of liberation and  of course  of rebellion. Thank you. Approximately    years ago  when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia  a father and a son walked into my office and they both had their right eye missing  and as I took the history  it became apparent that the father and the son had a rare form of inherited eye tumor  retinoblastoma  and the father knew that he had passed that fate on to his son. That moment changed my life. It propelled me to go on and to co lead a team that discovered the first cancer susceptibility gene  and in the intervening decades since then  there has been literally a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on  what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases. In fact  for thousands of human traits  a molecular basis that's known for that  and for thousands of people  every day  there's information that they gain about the risk of going on to get this disease or that disease. At the same time  if you ask   Has that impacted the efficiency  how we've been able to develop drugs   the answer is not really. If you look at the cost of developing drugs  how that's done  it basically hasn't budged that. And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose yet not the power to fully treat. And there are two commonly given reasons for why that happens. One of them is it's early days. We're just learning the words  the fragments  the letters in the genetic code. We don't know how to read the sentences. We don't know how to follow the narrative. The other reason given is that most of those changes are a loss of function  and it's actually really hard to develop drugs that restore function. But today  I want us to step back and ask a more fundamental question  and ask   What happens if we're thinking about this maybe in the wrong context   We do a lot of studying of those who are sick and building up long lists of altered components. But maybe  if what we're trying to do is to develop therapies for prevention  maybe what we should be doing is studying those who don't get sick. Maybe we should be studying those that are well. A vast majority of those people are not necessarily carrying a particular genetic load or risk factor. They're not going to help us. There are going to be those individuals who are carrying a potential future risk  they're going to go on to get some symptom. That's not what we're looking for. What we're asking and looking for is  are there a very few set of individuals who are actually walking around with the risk that normally would cause a disease  but something in them  something hidden in them is actually protective and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms  If you're going to do a study like that  you can imagine you'd like to look at lots and lots of people. We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study  and we realized that actually one way to think of this is  let us look at adults who are over    years of age  and let's make sure that we look at those who were healthy as kids. They might have had individuals in their families who had had a childhood disease  but not necessarily. And let's go and then screen those to find those who are carrying genes for childhood diseases. Now  some of you  I can see you putting your hands up going   Uh  a little odd. What's your evidence that this could be feasible   I want to give you two examples. The first comes from San Francisco. It comes from the     s and the     s  and you may know the story where there were individuals who had very high levels of the virus HIV. They went on to get AIDS. But there was a very small set of individuals who also had very high levels of HIV. They didn't get AIDS. And astute clinicians tracked that down  and what they found was they were carrying mutations. Notice  they were carrying mutations from birth that were protective  that were protecting them from going on to get AIDS. You may also know that actually a line of therapy has been coming along based on that fact. Second example  more recent  is elegant work done by Helen Hobbs  who said   I'm going to look at individuals who have very high lipid levels  and I'm going to try to find those people with high lipid levels who don't go on to get heart disease.  And again  what she found was some of those individuals had mutations that were protective from birth that kept them  even though they had high lipid levels  and you can see this is an interesting way of thinking about how you could develop preventive therapies. The project that we're working on is called  The Resilience Project  A Search for Unexpected Heroes   because what we are interested in doing is saying  can we find those rare individuals who might have these hidden protective factors  And in some ways  think of it as a decoder ring  a sort of resilience decoder ring that we're going to try to build. We've realized that we should  do this in a systematic way  so we've said  let's take every single childhood inherited disease. Let's take them all  and let's pull them back a little bit by those that are known to have severe symptoms  where the parents  the child  those around them would know that they'd gotten sick  and let's go ahead and then frame them again by those parts of the genes where we know that there is a particular alteration that is known to be highly penetrant to cause that disease. Where are we going to look  Well  we could look locally. That makes sense. But we began to think  maybe we should look all over the world. Maybe we should look not just here but in remote places where their might be a distinct genetic context  there might be environmental factors that protect people. And let's look at a million individuals. Now the reason why we think it's a good time to do that now is  in the last couple of years  there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost to do this type of analysis  this type of data generation  to where it actually costs less to do the data generation and analysis than it does to do the sample processing and the collection. The other reason is that in the last five years  there have been awesome tools  things about network biology  systems biology  that have come up that allow us to think that maybe we could decipher those positive outliers. And as we went around talking to researchers and institutions and telling them about our story  something happened. They started saying   This is interesting. I would be glad to join your effort. I would be willing to participate.  And they didn't say   Where's the MTA   They didn't say   Where is my authorship   They didn't say   Is this data going  to be mine  Am I going to own it   They basically said   Let's work on this in an open  crowd sourced  team way to do this decoding.  Six months ago  we locked down the screening key for this decoder. My co lead  a brilliant scientist  Eric Schadt at the Icahn Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  and his team  locked in that decoder key ring  and we began looking for samples  because what we realized is  maybe we could just go and look at some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility. Maybe we could take two  three  percent of the project on  and see if it was there. And so we started asking people such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. We asked Leif up in Finland. We talked to Anne Wojcicki at   andMe  and Wang Jun at BGI  and again  something remarkable happened. They said   Huh  not only do we have samples  but often we've analyzed them  and we would be glad to go into our anonymized samples and see if we could find those that you're looking for.  And instead of being        or         last month we passed one half million samples that we've already analyzed. So you must be going   Huh  did you find any unexpected heroes   And the answer is  we didn't find one or two. We found dozens of these strong candidate unexpected heroes. So we think that the time is now to launch the beta phase of this project and actually start getting prospective individuals. Basically all we need is information. We need a swab of DNA and a willingness to say   What's inside me  I'm willing to be re contacted.  Most of us spend our lives  when it comes to health and disease  acting as if we're voyeurs. We delegate the responsibility for the understanding of our disease  for the treatment of our disease  to anointed experts. In order for us to get this project to work  we need individuals to step up in a different role and to be engaged  to realize this dream  this open crowd sourced project  to find those unexpected heroes  to evolve from the current concepts of resources and constraints  to design those preventive therapies  and to extend it beyond childhood diseases  to go all the way up to ways that we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's  we're going to need us to be looking inside ourselves and asking   What are our roles  What are our genes   and looking within ourselves for information we used to say we should go to the outside  to experts  and to be willing to share that with others. Thank you very much.   It's all there in gospels    A Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects     But her mind is awhirl     When she finds the tomb empty     Straw had been rolled     Not a sign of a corpse     In the dark and the cold     When she reaches the door     Sees an unholy sight     There's a solitary figure and a halo of light     He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill     In an Almighty hurry     Aye  but she might catch him still     Tell me where are you gone  Lord     And why in such haste      Oh don't hinder me  woman     I've no time to waste     For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon     And I have to be there before daybreak     Oh I cannot be missing     The lads'll expect me     Why else would the Good Lord Himself resurrect me      For nothing'll stop me. I have to prevail     Through the teeth of this tempest     In the mouth of a gale     May the angels protect me     If all else should fail     And the last ship sails     Oh the roar of the chains     And the cracking of timbers     The noise at the end of the world in your ears     As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea     And the last ship sails   So I was born and raised in the shadow of a shipyard in a little town on the northeast coast of England. Some of my earliest memories are of giant ships blocking the end of my street  as well as the sun  for a lot of the year. Every morning as a child  I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill to work in the shipyard. I'd watch those same men walking back home every night. It has to be said  the shipyard was not the most pleasant place to live next door to  or indeed work in. The shipyard was noisy  dangerous  highly toxic  with an appalling health and safety record. Despite that  the men and women who worked on those ships were extraordinarily proud of the work they did  and justifiably so. Some of the largest vessels ever constructed on planet Earth were built right at the end of my street. My grandfather had been a shipwright  and as a child  as there were few other jobs in the town  I would wonder with some anxiety whether that would be my destiny too. I was fairly determined that it wouldn't be. I had other dreams  not necessarily practical ones  but at the age of eight  I was bequeathed a guitar. It was a battered old thing with five rusty strings  and was out of tune  but quickly I learned to play it and realized that I'd found a friend for life  an accomplice  a co conspirator in my plan to escape from this surreal industrial landscape. Well  they say if you dream something hard enough  it will come to pass. Either that  or I was extremely lucky  but this was my dream. I dreamt I would leave this town  and just like those ships  once they were launched  I'd never come back. I dreamt I'd become a writer of songs  that I would sing those songs to vast numbers of people all over the world  that I would be paid extravagant amounts of money  that I'd become famous  that I'd marry a beautiful woman  have children  raise a family  buy a big house in the country  keep dogs  grow wine  have rooms full of Grammy Awards  platinum discs  and what have you. So far  so good  right   Laughter  And then one day  the songs stopped coming  and while you've suffered from periods of writer's block before  albeit briefly  this is something chronic. Day after day  you face a blank page  and nothing's coming. And those days turned to weeks  and weeks to months  and pretty soon those months have turned into years with very little to show for your efforts. No songs. So you start asking yourself questions. What have I done to offend the gods that they would abandon me so  Is the gift of songwriting taken away as easily as it seems to have been bestowed  Or perhaps there's a more    a deeper psychological reason. It was always a Faustian pact anyway. You're rewarded for revealing your innermost thoughts  your private emotions on the page for the entertainment of others  for the analysis  the scrutiny of others  and perhaps you've given enough of your privacy away. And yet  if you look at your work  could it be argued that your best work wasn't about you at all  it was about somebody else  Did your best work occur when you sidestepped your own ego and you stopped telling your story  but told someone else's story  someone perhaps without a voice  where empathetically  you stood in his shoes for a while or saw the world through his eyes  Well they say  write what you know. If you can't write about yourself anymore  then who do you write about  So it's ironic that the landscape I'd worked so hard to escape from  and the community that I'd more or less abandoned and exiled myself from should be the very landscape  the very community I would have to return to to find my missing muse. And as soon as I did that  as soon as I decided to honor the community I came from and tell their story  that the songs started to come thick and fast. I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting  a torrent of ideas  of characters  of voices  of verses  couplets  entire songs almost formed whole  materialized in front of me as if they'd been bottled up inside me for many  many years. One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names of people I'd known  and they become characters in a kind of three dimensional drama  where they explain who they are  what they do  their hopes and their fears for the future. This is Jackie White. He's the foreman of the shipyard. My name is Jackie White  and I'm foreman of the yard  and you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside. I'm as hard as iron plate  woe betide you if you're late when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide. Now you can die and hope for heaven  but you need to work your shift  and I'd expect you all to back us to the hilt  for if St. Peter at his gate were to ask you why you're late  why  you tell him that you had to get a ship built. We build battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen  supertankers for Onassis  and all the classes in between  We built the greatest ship in tonnage what the world has ever seen   And the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard     Steel in the stockyard  iron in the soul     Would conjure up a ship     Where there used to be a hull     And we don't know what we'll do     If this yard gets sold     For the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard   So having decided to write about other people instead of myself  a further irony is that sometimes you reveal more about yourself than you'd ever intended. This song is called  Dead Man's Boots   which is an expression which describes how difficult it is to get a job  in other words  you'd only get a job in the shipyard if somebody else died. Or perhaps your father could finagle you an apprenticeship at the age of   . But sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued as controlling  and conversely  the scope of his son's ambition can seem like some pie in the sky fantasy.   You see these work boots in my hands     They'll probably fit you now  my son     Take them  they're a gift from me     Why don't you try them on      It would do your old man good to see     You walking in these boots one day     And take your place among the men     Who work upon the slipway     These dead man's boots  though they're old and curled     When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world     And it's time for a man to put down roots     And walk to the river in his old man's boots     He said   I'm dying  son  and asking     That you do one final thing for me     You're barely but a sapling  and you think that you're a tree     If you need a seed to prosper     You must first put down some roots     Just one foot then the other in     These dead man's boots      These dead man's boots  though they're old and curled     When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world     And it's time for a man to put down roots     And walk to the river in his old man's boots     I said   Why in the hell would I do that      Why would I agree       When his hand was all that I'd received     As far as I remember     It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness     Up to then  you see     I'd a plan of my own and I'd quit this place     When I came of age September     These dead man's boots know their way down the hill     They could walk there themselves  and they probably will     I've plenty of choices  I've plenty other routes     And you'll never see me walking in these dead man's boots     What was it made him think     I'd be happy ending up like him     When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left     Or a broken pot to piss in      He wanted this same thing for me     Was that his final wish      He said   What the hell are you gonna do       I said   Anything but this       These dead man's boots know their way down the hill     They can walk there themselves and they probably will     But they won't walk with me  cause I'm off the other way     I've had it up to here  I'm gonna have my say     When all you've got left is that cross on the wall     I want nothing from you  I want nothing at all     Not a pension  nor a pittance  when your whole life is through     Get this through your head  I'm nothing like you     I'm done with all the arguments  there'll be no more disputes     And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots   Thank you. So whenever they'd launch a big ship  they would invite some dignitary up from London on the train to make a speech  break a bottle of champagne over the bows  launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea. Occasionally on a really important ship  they'd get a member of the royal family to come  Duke of Edinburgh  Princess Anne or somebody. And you have to remember  it wasn't that long ago that the royal family in England were considered to have magical healing powers. Sick children were held up in crowds to try and touch the cloak of the king or the queen to cure them of some terrible disease. It wasn't like that in my day  but we still got very excited. So it's a launch day  it's a Saturday  and my mother has dressed me up in my Sunday best. I'm not very happy with her. All the kids are out in the street  and we have little Union Jacks to wave  and at the top of the hill  there's a motorcycle cortege appears. In the middle of the motorcycles  there's a big  black Rolls Royce. Inside the Rolls Royce is the Queen Mother. This is a big deal. So the procession is moving at a stately pace down my street  and as it approaches my house  I start to wave my flag vigorously  and there is the Queen Mother. I see her  and she seems to see me. She acknowledges me. She waves  and she smiles. And I wave my flag even more vigorously. We're having a moment  me and the Queen Mother. She's acknowledged me. And then she's gone. Well  I wasn't cured of anything. It was the opposite  actually. I was infected. I was infected with an idea. I don't belong in this street. I don't want to live in that house. I don't want to end up in that shipyard. I want to be in that car.  Laughter  I want a bigger life. I want a life beyond this town. I want a life that's out of the ordinary. It's my right. It's my right as much as hers. And so here I am at TED  I suppose to tell that story  and I think it's appropriate to say the obvious that there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link between storytelling and community  between community and art  between community and science and technology  between community and economics. It's my belief that abstract economic theory that denies the needs of community or denies the contribution that community makes to economy is shortsighted  cruel and untenable. The fact is  whether you're a rock star or whether you're a welder in a shipyard  or a tribesman in the upper Amazon  or the queen of England  at the end of the day  we're all in the same boat.   Aye  the footmen are frantic in their indignation     You see the queen's took a taxi herself to the station     Where the porters  surprised by her lack of royal baggage     Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage     For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility     And there's none of them famous for their compatibility     There's a fight over seats      I beg pardon  Your Grace     But you'll find that one's mine  so get back in your place        Aye  but where are they going       All the porters debate      Why they're going to Newcastle and they daren't be late     For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide     And they've come from all over  from far and from wide      There's the old Dalai Lama     And the pontiff of Rome     Every palace in Europe  and there's nay bugger home     There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales     Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails     Well  they haven't got tickets     Come now  it's just a detail     There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail     For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail      When the last ship sails     Oh the roar of the chains     And the cracking of timbers     The noise at the end of the world in your ears     As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea     And the last ship sails     And whatever you'd promised     Whatever you've done     And whatever the station in life you've become     In the name of the Father  in the name of the Son     And no matter the weave of this life that you've spun     On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun     When the last ship sails     Oh the roar of the chains     And the cracking of timbers     The noise at the end of the world in your ears     As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea     And the last ship sails   Thanks very much for listening to my song. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Okay  you have to join in if you know it.
