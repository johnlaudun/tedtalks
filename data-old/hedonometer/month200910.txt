I have a very difficult task. I'm a spectroscopist. I have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies  etc. because my job is spectroscopy. I never deal with images. But I'll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world. Spectroscopy can probably answer the question   Is there anybody out there   Are we alone  SETI. It's not very fun to do spectroscopy. One of my colleagues in Bulgaria  Nevena Markova  spent about    years studying these profiles. And she published    articles just dedicated to the subject. Can you imagine  Day and night  thinking  observing  the same star for    years is incredible. But we are crazy. We do these things. And I'm not that far. I spent about eight months working on these profiles. Because I've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars. And I thought  well maybe there is Lithium   in this star  which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet. Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope of Lithium   in the atmospheres of sun like stars. But you have it in planets and asteroids. So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids  you will have this Lithium   isotope in the spectrum of the star. So I invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star. And actually it's amazing  because I got phone calls from many reporters asking   Have you actually seen the planet going into a star   Because they thought that if you are having a telescope  you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope. And you might have seen the planet going into a star. And I was saying   No  excuse me. What I see is this one.  It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really. I bet that there were very few people who really understood what I'm talking about. Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star. It's amazing. The power of spectroscopy was actually realized by Pink Floyd already in     . Because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum. And all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph. This is the number one high resolution  most precise spectrograph on this planet  called HARPS  which is actually used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars. How we get spectra  I'm sure most of you know from school physics that it's basically splitting a white light into colors. And if you have a liquid hot mass  it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum. A hot gas is producing emission lines only  no continuum. And if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source  you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines. Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter  which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies. Now  what we can do with the spectra  We can actually study line of sight velocities of cosmic objects. And we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars  galaxies  nebulae. A star is the most simple object. In the core  we have thermonuclear reactions going on  creating chemical elements. And we have a cool atmosphere. It's cool for me. Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees. My colleagues in infra red astronomy call minus     Kelvin is cool for them. But you know  everything is relative. So for me       degrees is pretty cool. This is the spectrum of the Sun           spectral lines  and about    percent of these lines is not yet identified. It is amazing. So we are in the   st century  and we still cannot properly understand the spectrum of the sun. Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny  weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere. For instance  you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun. And we use this weak feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun. And now this is a work in progress. We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature  which belongs to osmium. It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae. It's the only place where you can produce  actually  osmium. Just comparing the composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars  we want to understand why there is so much of this element. Perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars. It can be an indication. The other day  my colleague from Berkeley  Gibor Basri  emailed me a very interesting spectrum  asking me   Can you have a look at this   And I couldn't sleep  next two weeks  when I saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars. I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy. It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system  which polluted the atmosphere of this star. And later a black hole was formed in a binary system  which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses. This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions. My colleagues  comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars  actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy. It's amazing that you can go so far simply studying the chemical composition of stars. They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy. There is interaction of galaxies. We know this. And sometimes they just capture stars. You've heard about solar flares. We were very surprised to discover a super flare  a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the Sun. In one of the binary stars in our galaxy called FH Leo  we discovered the super flare. And later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects. And we found that everything is normal. These stars are normal like the Sun. Age  everything was normal. So this is a mystery. It's one of the mysteries we still have  super flares. And there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature. Now to go ahead with this  we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe. It's very complicated. I don't really want you to try to understand what is here. But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the production of chemical elements. You have two channels    the massive stars and low mass stars    producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe. And doing this for    billion years  we end up with this picture  which is a very important graph  showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun like stars and in the interstellar medium. So which means that it's really impossible to find an object where you find about    times more sulfur than silicon  five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible. And if you find one  I will say that this is something related to SETI  because naturally you can't do it. Doppler Effect is something very important from fundamental physics. And this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source. The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets. The precision which we need to discover a Jupiter like planet around a sun like star is something like   .  meters per second. And we need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth like planet. This can be done with the future spectrographs. I  myself  I'm actually involved in the team which is developing a CODEX  high resolution  future generation spectrograph for the    meter E ELT telescope. And this is going to be an instrument to detect Earth like planets around sun like stars. It is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars. This is the sound of an Alpha Cen. We can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun like stars. Those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain  the sound actually nobody knows  domain. Coming back to the most important question   Is there anybody out there   This is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets. Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward. No life without tectonic activity  without volcanic activity. And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium  thorium  and potassium. How to measure  if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small  so those planets are tectonically dead  there cannot be life. If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium  probably  again  there would be no life. Because can you imagine everything boiling  It's too much energy on a planet. Now  we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets. It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature. We are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium. It's very tough. It's very tough. And you have to  first you have to convince yourself. Then you have to convince your colleagues. And then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in     parsec away from here. It's really difficult. But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets  you have to do this job. Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems. The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals. If you receive something interesting  well that's what SETI does actually  what SETI has been doing for many years. I think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers. You can see the spectrum of the Earth  this Earthshine spectrum  and that is a very clear signal. The slope which is coming  which we call a Red Edge  is a detection of vegetated area. It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum. Now imagine doing this test for other planets. Now very recently  very recently  I'm talking about last six  seven  eight months  water  methane  carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system. It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy. You can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far  far  far from solar system. We have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life. Cosmic miracles are something which can be related to SETI. Now imagine an object  amazing object  or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say   Look  we give up. Physics doesn't work.  So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say   Well  somebody must be doing this  somehow.  And with the known physics etc  it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake  many years ago  and Shklovsky. If you see  in the spectrum of a planet host star  if you see strange chemical elements  it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it. They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines  in the spectrum of a star  in different ways. There can be different ways doing this. One is  for instance  technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of  .  million years. If you suddenly observe technetium in a sun like star  you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere  because in a natural way it is impossible to do this. Now we are reviewing the spectra of about     stars with extrasolar planets. And we are doing this job since      and it's a very heavy project. We have been working very hard. And we have some interesting cases  candidates  so on  things which we can't really explain. And I hope in the near future we can confirm this. So the main question   Are we alone   I think it will not come from UFOs. It will not come from radio signals. I think it will come from a spectrum like this. It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth  showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide  as a clear signal of life  and oxygen and ozone. If  one day  and I think it will be within    years from now  or    years. If we discover a spectrum like this we can be sure that there is life on that planet. In about five years we will discover planets like Earth  around sun like stars  the same distance as the Earth from the Sun. It will take about five years. And then we will need another        years with space projects to get the spectra of Earth like planets like the one I showed you. And if we see the nitrogen dioxide and oxygen  I think we have the perfect E.T. Thank you very much. I run a design studio in New York. Every seven years  I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments  things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year. In that year  we are not available for any of our clients. We are totally closed. And as you can imagine  it is a lovely and very energetic time. I originally had opened the studio in New York to combine my two loves  music and design. And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know  and for even more that you've never heard of. As I realized  just like with many many things in my life that I actually love  I adapt to it. And I get  over time  bored by them. And for sure  in our case  our work started to look the same. You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book. Quite the similar idea  then  a perfume packaged in a book  in a die cut. So I decided to close it down for one year. Also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first    years of our lives learning  then there is another    years that's really reserved for working. And then tacked on at the end of it are about    years for retirement. And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years. That's clearly enjoyable for myself. But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large  rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two. There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago  Jonathan Haidt  who defined his work into three different levels. And they rang very true for me. I can see my work as a job. I do it for money. I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays. And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism. In a career I'm definitely more engaged. But at the same time  there will be periods when I think is all that really hard work really worth my while  While in the third one  in the calling  very much likely I would do it also if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it. I am not a religious person myself  but I did look for nature. I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City. Looked for something different for the second one. Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing because I knew them too well. So Asia it was. The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali. Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on  so Bali it was. It's a wonderful  very craft oriented society. I arrived there in September       and pretty much started to work right away. There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself. However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily. And then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house  and attacked me during my morning walks. So we created this series of    portraits on tee shirts. Every single dog on one tee shirt. As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message on the back of the shirt. Just before I left New York I decided I could actually renovate my studio. And then just leave it all to them. And I don't have to do anything. So I looked for furniture. And it turned out that all the furniture that I really liked  I couldn't afford. And all the stuff I could afford  I didn't like. So one of the things that we pursued in Bali was pieces of furniture. This one  of course  still works with the wild dogs. It's not quite finished yet. And I think by the time this lamp came about  I had finally made peace with those dogs. Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table. It's called Be Here Now. It includes     compasses. And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside  and make those compasses go crazy  always centering on them. Then this is a fairly talkative  verbose kind of chair. I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali. And at the same time  I'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses. So I will not really go too far into it. Many of you will know this TEDster  Danny Gilbert  whose book  actually  I got it through the TED book club. I think it took me four years to finally read it  while on sabbatical. And I was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical. And I'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals. This is Ferran Adria. Many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of Barcelona  El Bulli. His restaurant is open seven months every year. He closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff. His latest numbers are fairly impressive. He can seat  throughout the year  he can seat       people. And he has  .  million requests for reservations. If I look at my cycle  seven years  one year sabbatical  it's   .  percent of my time. And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine   M since the     s is giving all their engineers    percent to pursue whatever they want. There is some good successes. Scotch tape came out of this program  as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for  M. Google  of course  very famously gives    percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects. Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical  That's about five percent of everybody. So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up. Talk to them about if it was successful or not. I've found that finding out about what I'm going to like in the future  my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it. When I had the idea of doing one  the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book. And then I told as many  many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on. In the beginning  on the first sabbatical  it was rather disastrous. I had thought that I should do this without any plan  that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation. It was not. I just  without a plan  I just reacted to little requests  not work requests  those I all said no to  but other little requests. Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that. So I became my own intern. And I very quickly made a list of the things I was interested in  put them in a hierarchy  divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan  very much like in grade school. What does it say here  Monday    to    story writing    to     future thinking. Was not very successful. And so on and so forth. And that actually  specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical  worked really well for me. What came out of it  I really got close to design again. I had fun. Financially  seen over the long term  it was actually successful. Because of the improved quality  we could ask for higher prices. And probably most importantly  basically everything we've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year. And I'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical. One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated. This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies  and not for everybody else. We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica  the Rem Koolhaas built music center in Porto  in Portugal. And even though I desired to do an identity that doesn't use the architecture  I failed at that. And mostly also because I realized out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto  where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning. Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English  basically as logo making. And I understood that the building itself was a logo. So then it became quite easy. We put a mask on it  looked at it deep down in the ground  checked it out from all sides  west  north  south  east  top and bottom. Colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software  the Casa da Musica Logo Generator. That's connected to a scanner. You put any image in there  like that Beethoven image. And the software  in a second  will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo. Which  when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster  comes in handy  because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same. So it will always fit together  conceptually  of course. If Zappa's music is performed  it gets its own logo. Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers  who all performed there  get their own Casa da Musica logo. It works the same internally with the president or the musical director  whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards. There is a full blown orchestra living inside the building. It has a more transparent identity. The truck they go on tour with. Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra     people that remixes its own title. And one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it. Like this Donna Toney poster  or Chopin  or Mozart  or La Monte Young. You can take the shape and make typography out of it. You can grow it underneath the skin. You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house  or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program  as well as educational services. Second insight. So far  until that point I had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes  which was fine with me. On one hand I have nothing against selling. My parents are both salespeople. But I did feel that I spent so much time learning this language  why do I only promote with it  There must be something else. And the whole series of work came out of it. Some of you might have seen it. I showed some of it at earlier TEDs before  under the title  Things I've Learned in My Life So Far.  I'll just show two now. This is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in New York. It says   Self confidence produces fine results.  This is after a week. After two weeks  three weeks  four weeks  five weeks. And you see the self confidence almost comes back  but not quite. These are some pictures visitors sent to me. And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something. We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece. We got         coins from the central bank  at different darknesses. So we got brand new ones  shiny ones  medium ones  and very old  dark ones. And with the help of     volunteers  over a week  created this fairly floral typography that spelled   Obsessions make my life worse and my work better.  And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between   Should I really take as much money as I can  Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now   While we built all this up during that week  with the     volunteers  a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it. So when it was finally done  and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry  one of the neighbors called the police. And the Amsterdam police in all their wisdom  came  saw  and they wanted to protect the artwork. And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters. I think you see  you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here. That's the police  getting rid of it all. So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing. We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali. It's a movie about happiness. And here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us. They weren't quite slick enough. So we asked the goose to do it again  and hoped she would do somehow  a more elegant or pretty job. And I think she overdid it. Just a bit too ornamental. And my studio is very close to the monkey forest. And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked  actually  fairly happy. So we asked those guys to do it again. They did a fine job  but had a couple of readability problems. So of course whatever you don't really do yourself doesn't really get done properly. That film we'll be working on for the next two years. So it's going to be a while. And of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile. Then you can of course always go and see this guy. Video   Laughter  And I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. Stefan Sagmeister  Thank you. How do you feed a city  It's one of the great questions of our time. Yet it's one that's rarely asked. We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant  or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time  there is going to be food there waiting for us  having magically come from somewhere. But when you think that every day for a city the size of London  enough food has to be produced  transported  bought and sold  cooked  eaten  disposed of  and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth  it's remarkable that cities get fed at all. We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world  forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat  we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were. And as more of us move into cities  more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me    it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil    in order to feed us. These are extraordinary landscapes  but few of us ever get to see them. And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either. As more of us move into cities  more of us are eating meat  so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals. And given that it takes three times as much grain    actually ten times as much grain    to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first  that's not a very efficient way of feeding us. And it's an escalating problem too. By       it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities. And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed. So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand. And that's going to pose an enormous problem. Six billion hungry carnivores to feed  by     . That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are  it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve. Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land. Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion. We're very hungry for fossil fuels too. It takes about    calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West. And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost  we don't actually value it. Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away. And to end all of this  at the end of this long process  we're not even managing to feed the planet properly. A billion of us are obese  while a further billion starve. None of it makes very much sense. And when you think that    percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations  it's a grim picture. As we're moving into cities  the world is also embracing a Western diet. And if we look to the future  it's an unsustainable diet. So how did we get here  And more importantly  what are we going to do about it  Well  to answer the slightly easier question first  about        years ago  I would say  is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East  known as the Fertile Crescent. Because  as you can see  it was crescent shaped. And it was also fertile. And it was here  about        years ago  that two extraordinary inventions  agriculture and urbanism  happened roughly in the same place and at the same time. This is no accident  because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other. Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements. And if we look at what those settlements were like  we see they were compact. They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur  that were  in fact  effectively  spiritualized  central food distribution centers. Because it was the temples that organized the harvest  gathered in the grain  offered it to the gods  and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people. So  if you like  the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them. And in fact  that's true of every ancient city. But of course not all of them were that small. Famously  Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D. So how did a city like this feed itself  The answer is what I call  ancient food miles.  Basically  Rome had access to the sea  which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away. This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world  because it was very difficult to transport food over roads  which were rough. And the food obviously went off very quickly. So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves. And  in fact  you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long  drawn out militarized shopping spree  really. In fact    I love the fact  I just have to mention this  Rome in fact used to import oysters from London  at one stage. I think that's extraordinary. So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite. But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre industrial world. If we look at a map of London in the   th century  we can see that its grain  which is coming in from the Thames  along the bottom of this map. So the grain markets were to the south of the city. And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside  which was the main market  were also grain markets. And if you look at the name of one of those streets  Bread Street  you can tell what was going on there     years ago. And the same of course was true for fish. Fish was  of course  coming in by river as well. Same thing. And of course Billingsgate  famously  was London's fish market  operating on site here until the mid     s. Which is extraordinary  really  when you think about it. Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port. This is another thing about food in cities  Once its roots into the city are established  they very rarely move. Meat is a very different story because  of course  animals could walk into the city. So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest  from Scotland and Wales. So it was coming in  and arriving at the city at the northwest  which is why Smithfield  London's very famous meat market  was located up there. Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on  to the northeast. I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway  and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes. And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside  that's where they were sold  which is why it's called Poultry. And  in fact  if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age  you can trace food coming in to it. You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food  both by reading the names of the streets  which give you a lot of clues. Friday Street  in a previous life  is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday. But also you have to imagine it full of food. Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold. And if we look at an image of Smithfield in      you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from. In fact  if you were having Sunday lunch  the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier. So this was obviously an organic city  part of an organic cycle. And then    years later everything changed. This is an image of the Great Western in     . And as you can see  some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep. So all of a sudden  these animals are no longer walking into market. They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind  somewhere in the countryside. And they're coming into the city by rail. And this changes everything. To start off with  it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities  really any size and shape  in any place. Cities used to be constrained by geography  they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means. All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography. And as you can see from these maps of London  in the    years after the trains came  it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot  and so on  to a large splurge  that would be very  very difficult to feed with anybody on foot  either animals or people. And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars  and really this marks the end of this process. It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all. And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell  devoid of mess  certainly devoid of people  because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape. In fact  what they did to get food was they got in their cars  drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts  came back with a week's worth of shopping  and wondered what on earth to do with it. And this really is the moment when our relationship  both with food and cities  changes completely. Here we have food    that used to be the center  the social core of the city    at the periphery. It used to be a social event  buying and selling food. Now it's anonymous. We used to cook  now we just add water  or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something. We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat. We just read the back of a label on a packet. And we don't value food. We don't trust it. So instead of trusting it  we fear it. And instead of valuing it  we throw it away. One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder. By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place  they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship  which is that of us and nature. And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver  that  as we've seen  are unsustainable. So what are we going to do about that  It's not a new question.     years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself. This is the frontispiece of his book  Utopia.  And it was a series of semi independent city states  if that sounds remotely familiar  a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming mad  and grew vegetables in their back gardens  and ate communal meals together  and so on. And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia  even though More never framed it that way. And here is another very famous  Utopian  vision  that of Ebenezer Howard   The Garden City.  Same idea  series of semi independent city states  little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around  joined to one another by railway. And again  food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision. It even got built  but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had. And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas  that they are Utopian. Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately. It was a kind of joke  because it's got a double derivation from the Greek. It can either mean a good place  or no place. Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it. And I think  as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling  that makes it not much use. So I've come up with an alternative  which is Sitopia  from the ancient Greek   sitos  for food  and  topos  for place. I believe we already live in Sitopia. We live in a world shaped by food  and if we realize that  we can use food as a really powerful tool    a conceptual tool  design tool  to shape the world differently. So if we were to do that  what might Sitopia look like  Well I think it looks a bit like this. I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog. But anyway  this is     Laughter  it's food at the center of life  at the center of family life  being celebrated  being enjoyed  people taking time for it. This is where food should be in our society. But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this. By the way  these can be men as well. It's people who think about food  who think ahead  who plan  who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them. We need these people. We're part of a network. Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this. Here  I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable. But networks  markets where food is being grown locally. It's common. It's fresh. It's part of the social life of the city. Because without that  you can't have this kind of place  food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape  and is not just a zero sum commodity off in some unseen hell hole. Cows with a view. Steaming piles of humus. This is basically bringing the whole thing together. And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto. It's a greenhouse  where kids get told all about food and growing their own food. Here is a plant called Kevin  or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know. But anyway  these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important. So Sitopia  for me  is really a way of seeing. It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere. The trick is to join them up  to use food as a way of seeing. And if we do that  we're going to stop seeing cities as big  metropolitan  unproductive blobs  like this. We're going to see them more like this  as part of the productive  organic framework of which they are inevitably a part  symbiotically connected. But of course  that's not a great image either  because we need not to be producing food like this anymore. We need to be thinking more about permaculture  which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing. It's a re conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives. The best image I know of this is from     years ago. It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's  Allegory of Good Government.  It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside. And I think the message of this is very clear. If the city looks after the country  the country will look after the city. And I want us to ask now  what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today  What would an allegory of good government look like today  Because I think it's an urgent question. It's one we have to ask  and we have to start answering. We know we are what we eat. We need to realize that the world is also what we eat. But if we take that idea  we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better. Thank you very much. What we're really here to talk about is the  how.  Okay  so how exactly do we create this world shattering  if you will  innovation  Now  I want to tell you a quick story. We'll go back a little more than a year. In fact  the date    I'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date  It was February  rd      . Anyone remember what happened  February  rd        Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl. And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues  John King and Halee Fischer Wright  and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties  is that it seemed to us that across the United States  if you will  tribal councils had convened. And they had discussed things of great national importance. Like   Do we like the Budweiser commercial   and   Do we like the nachos   and   Who is going to win   But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support. And if you go back in time to February  rd  it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination. And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way. But when we talked to people  it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States. Now what is a tribe  A tribe is a group of about       so kind of more than a team       to about     people. And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done. But not just work. It's within these tribes that societies get built  that important things happen. And so as we surveyed the  if you will  representatives from various tribal councils that met  also known as Super Bowl parties  we sent the following email off to    newspaper editors the following day. February  th  we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday. We said   The tribes that we're in are saying it's going to be Obama.  Now  the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous    years studying tribes  studying these naturally occurring groups. All of you are members of tribes. In walking around at the break  many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them. And many of you were doing what great  if you will  tribal leaders do  which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe  and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe  and make introductions. That is in fact what great tribal leaders do. So here is the bottom line. If you focus in on a group like this    this happens to be a USC game    and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people  you would in fact see not a single crowd  just like there is not a single crowd here  but you would see these tribes that are then coming together. And from a distance it appears that it's a single group. And so people form tribes. They always have. They always will. Just as fish swim and birds fly  people form tribes. It's just what we do. But here's the rub. Not all tribes are the same  and what makes the difference is the culture. Now here is the net out of this. You're all a member of tribes. If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward  along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five  which is the top of the mountain. But we're going to start with what we call Stage One. Now  this is the lowest of the stages. You don't want this. Okay  This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen. But it's one that I think we need to learn from. Stage One produces people who do horrible things. This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech. Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes  and then pool together with people who think like they do. Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons. Now  again  we don't often deal with Stage One. And I want to make the point that as members of society  we need to. It's not enough to simply write people off. But let's move on to Stage Two. Now  Stage One  you'll notice  says  in effect   Life Sucks.  So  this other book that Steve mentioned  that just came out  called  The Three Laws of Performance   my colleague  Steve Zaffron and I  argue that as people see the world  so they behave. Well  if people see the world in such a way that life sucks  then their behavior will follow automatically from that. It will be despairing hostility. They'll do whatever it takes to survive  even if that means undermining other people. Now  my birthday is coming up shortly  and my driver's license expires. And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe  which looks like this. Now  am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles across the land  you find a Stage Two culture  No. But in the one near me  where I have to go in just a few days  what I will say when I'm standing in line is   How can people be so dumb  and yet live   Now  am I saying that there are dumb people working here  Actually  no  I'm not. But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb. So in a Stage Two culture    and we find these in all sorts of different places    you find them  in fact  in the best organizations in the world. You find them in all places in society. I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class. But here is the point. If you believe and you say to people in your tribe  in effect   My life sucks. I mean  if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.  If that's how you talked  imagine what kind of work would get done. What kind of innovation would get done  The amount of world changing behavior that would happen  In fact it would be basically nil. Now when we go on to Stage Three  this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us. Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move. And we park. And we stay. Stage Three says   I'm great. And you're not.  I'm great and you're not. Now imagine having a whole room of people saying  in effect   I'm great and you're not.  Or   I'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that.  A whole group of people communicating that way  talking that way. I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar. But  in this case  three doctors walk into an elevator. I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book. And one doctor said to the others   Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine   And the other said   No. That's great. Congratulations   The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said   Well while you were  you know  doing your research      notice the condescending tone     While you were off doing your research  I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution.  And the third one got the same wry smile and said   Well  while you were off doing your research  and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery  that eventually we'll train monkeys to do  or cells or robots  or maybe not even need to do it at all  I was off running the future of the residency program  which is really the future of medicine.  And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back. And the elevator door opened  and they all walked out. That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe. Now  we find these in places where really smart  successful people show up. Like  oh  I don't know  TEDx USC. Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation. It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four. Let's take a look at a quick video snippet. This is from a company called Zappos  located outside Las Vegas. And my question on the other side is just going to be   What do you think they value   It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree. This is their lobby. Employees volunteer time in the advice booth. Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon. Okay  we're going through the hallway here at Zappos. This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated. Notice people are applauding for us. They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did they probably wouldn't applaud. But you'll notice the level of excitement. Notice  again  how they decorate their office. Now  what's important to people at Zappos  these may not be the things that are important to you. But they value things like fun. And they value creativity. One of their stated values is   Be a little bit weird.  And you'll notice they are a little bit weird. So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that's greater than their individual competence  then something very important happens. The group gels. And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually centric people into something larger  into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence. Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things. But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet. There is  in fact  another stage. Now  some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here. And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five  which is  Life is Great   this may seem a little incongruous. This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize. Now think about that. South Africa  terrible atrocities had happened in the society. And people came together focused only on those two values  truth and reconciliation. There was no road map. No one had ever done anything like this before. And in this atmosphere  where the only guidance was people's values and their noble cause  what this group accomplished was historic. And people  at the time  feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone  descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end. In fact  South Africa has not gone down that road. Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country  to bring everyone together. So  people hear this and they conclude the following  as did we in doing the study. Okay  got it. I don't want to talk Stage One. That's like  you know   Life sucks.  Who wants to talk that way  I don't want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives. I really don't want to just say  I'm great   because that kind of sounds narcissistic  and then I won't have any friends. Saying   We're great     that sounds pretty good. But I should really talk Stage Five  right   Life is great.  Well  in fact  there are three somewhat counter intuitive findings that come out of all this. The first one  if you look at the Declaration of Independence and actually read it  the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights. I mean  that's Stage Five  right  Life is great  oriented only by our values  no other guidance. In fact  most of the document is written at Stage Two.  My life sucks because I live under a tyrant  also known as King George. We're great  Who is not great  England   Sorry.  Laughter  Well  what about other great leaders  What about Gandhi  What about Martin Luther King  I mean  surely these were just people who preached   Life is great   right  Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another. In fact  Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three. He didn't say  We have a dream.  He said   I have a dream.  Why did he do that  Because most people are not at Stage Five. Two percent are at Stage One. About    percent are at Stage Two  saying  in effect   My life sucks.     percent of working tribes say  these are employed tribes  say   I'm great and you're not.  And we have to duke it out every day  so we resort to politics. Only about    percent of tribes are at Stage Four  oriented by our values  saying  We're great. And our values are beginning to unite us.  Only two percent  only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five. And those are the ones that change the world. So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society. But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay  Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are. So we have to have the ability to talk all the levels  to go to where they are. And then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level. I'd like to show you some examples of this. One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan  former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that he was Chief of Police in San Francisco. And he grew up essentially in Stage One. And you know what changed his life  It was walking into one of these  a Boys and Girls Club. Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco. He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One    remember   Life sucks  despairing hostility  I will do whatever it takes to survive     to walking into a Boys and Girls Club  folding his arms  sitting down in a chair  and saying   Wow. My life really sucks. I don't know anybody. I mean  if I was into boxing  like they were  then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does. So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything.  In fact  that's progress. We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then  over time  getting them connected. So  what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four  I want to argue that we're doing that right here. TED represents a set of values  and as we unite around these values  something really interesting begins to emerge. If you want this experience to live on as something historic  then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking. Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach  extend your influence  but instead  find someone you don't know  and find someone else you don't know  and introduce them. That's called a triadic relationship. See  people who build world changing tribes do that. They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them  not just to myself  so that my following is greater  but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves. And ultimately that adds to their values. But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four  which is great  to Stage Five  The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization. You know they do polls  right  So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great  Pretty much everybody else who does polls. If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll  people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay  we understand that. So  they were bored. They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.  How could we  instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks  or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that  what does the entire world think   And they found a way to do the first ever world poll. They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics  who reported being bored. And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out   How do we survey the population of Sub Saharan Africa  How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology  and speak languages we don't speak  and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order to achieve on this great mission  we have to be able to do it. Incidentally  they did pull it off. And they released the first ever world poll. So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts. First of all  we all form tribes  all of us. You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach of the tribes that you have. But the question on the table is this  What kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making  You're hearing one presentation after another  often representing a group of people  a tribe  about how they have changed the world. If you do what we've talked about  you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in. And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward. You remember to talk all five culture stages. Because we've got people in all five  around us. And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this  Will your tribes change the world  Thank you very much. I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call  the danger of the single story.  I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two  although I think four is probably close to the truth. So I was an early reader  and what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer  and when I began to write  at about the age of seven  stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read  I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading  All my characters were white and blue eyed  they played in the snow  they ate apples  and they talked a lot about the weather  how lovely it was that the sun had come out. Now  this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow  we ate mangoes  and we never talked about the weather  because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer  because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. And for many years afterwards  I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates  I think  is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story  particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign  I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now  things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available  and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye  I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me  girls with skin the color of chocolate  whose kinky hair could not form ponytails  could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now  I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this  It saved me from having a single story of what books are. I come from a conventional  middle class Nigerian family. My father was a professor. My mother was an administrator. And so we had  as was the norm  live in domestic help  who would often come from nearby rural villages. So  the year I turned eight  we got a new house boy. His name was Fide. The only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor. My mother sent yams and rice  and our old clothes  to his family. And when I didn't finish my dinner  my mother would say   Finish your food  Don't you know  People like Fide's family have nothing.  So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family. Then one Saturday  we went to his village to visit  and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made. I was startled. It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something. All I had heard about them was how poor they were  so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor. Their poverty was my single story of them. Years later  I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States. I was   . My American roommate was shocked by me. She asked where I had learned to speak English so well  and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language. She asked if she could listen to what she called my  tribal music   and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey. She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove. What struck me was this  She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me. Her default position toward me  as an African  was a kind of patronizing  well meaning pity. My roommate had a single story of Africa  a single story of catastrophe. In this single story  there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way  no possibility of feelings more complex than pity  no possibility of a connection as human equals. I must say that before I went to the U.S.  I didn't consciously identify as African. But in the U.S.  whenever Africa came up  people turned to me. Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia. But I did come to embrace this new identity  and in many ways I think of myself now as African. Although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country  the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos two days ago  in which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight about the charity work in  India  Africa and other countries.  So  after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African  I began to understand my roommate's response to me. If I had not grown up in Nigeria  and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images  I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes  beautiful animals  and incomprehensible people  fighting senseless wars  dying of poverty and AIDS  unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind  white foreigner. I would see Africans in the same way that I  as a child  had seen Fide's family. This single story of Africa ultimately comes  I think  from Western literature. Now  here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Locke  who sailed to west Africa in      and kept a fascinating account of his voyage. After referring to the black Africans as  beasts who have no houses   he writes   They are also people without heads  having their mouth and eyes in their breasts.  Now  I've laughed every time I've read this. And one must admire the imagination of John Locke. But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West  A tradition of Sub Saharan Africa as a place of negatives  of difference  of darkness  of people who  in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling  are  half devil  half child.  And so  I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story  as had a professor  who once told me that my novel was not  authentically African.  Now  I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel  that it had failed in a number of places  but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity. In fact  I did not know what African authenticity was. The professor told me that my characters were too much like him  an educated and middle class man. My characters drove cars. They were not starving. Therefore they were not authentically African. But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story. A few years ago  I visited Mexico from the U.S. The political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense  and there were debates going on about immigration. And  as often happens in America  immigration became synonymous with Mexicans. There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system  sneaking across the border  being arrested at the border  that sort of thing. I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara  watching the people going to work  rolling up tortillas in the marketplace  smoking  laughing. I remember first feeling slight surprise. And then  I was overwhelmed with shame. I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind  the abject immigrant. I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself. So that is how to create a single story  show a people as one thing  as only one thing  over and over again  and that is what they become. It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power. There is a word  an Igbo word  that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world  and it is  nkali.  It's a noun that loosely translates to  to be greater than another.  Like our economic and political worlds  stories too are defined by the principle of nkali  How they are told  who tells them  when they're told  how many stories are told  are really dependent on power. Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person  but to make it the definitive story of that person. The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people  the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with   secondly.  Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans  and not with the arrival of the British  and you have an entirely different story. Start the story with the failure of the African state  and not with the colonial creation of the African state  and you have an entirely different story. I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. I told him that I had just read a novel called  American Psycho        and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers. Now  obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation. But it would never have occurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all Americans. This is not because I am a better person than that student  but because of America's cultural and economic power  I had many stories of America. I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill. I did not have a single story of America. When I learned  some years ago  that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful  I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me. But the truth is that I had a very happy childhood  full of laughter and love  in a very close knit family. But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps. My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare. One of my closest friends  Okoloma  died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water. I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education  so that sometimes  my parents were not paid their salaries. And so  as a child  I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table  then margarine disappeared  then bread became too expensive  then milk became rationed. And most of all  a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives. All of these stories make me who I am. But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me. The single story creates stereotypes  and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue  but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story. Of course  Africa is a continent full of catastrophes  There are immense ones  such as the horrific rapes in Congo and depressing ones  such as the fact that       people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria. But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe  and it is very important  it is just as important  to talk about them. I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person. The consequence of the single story is this  It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar. So what if before my Mexican trip  I had followed the immigration debate from both sides  the U.S. and the Mexican  What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor and hardworking  What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world  What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls  a balance of stories.  What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher  Muhtar Bakare  a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house  Now  the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature. He disagreed. He felt that people who could read  would read  if you made literature affordable and available to them. Shortly after he published my first novel  I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview  and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said   I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending. Now  you must write a sequel  and this is what will happen ...  And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel. I was not only charmed  I was very moved. Here was a woman  part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians  who were not supposed to be readers. She had not only read the book  but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel. Now  what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda  a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos  and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget  What if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week  What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music  talented people singing in English and Pidgin  and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo  mixing influences from Jay Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers. What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports  What if my roommate knew about Nollywood  full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds  films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce  What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider  who has just started her own business selling hair extensions  Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail  but continue to nurse ambition  Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians  our failed infrastructure  our failed government  but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government  rather than because of it. I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer  and it is amazing to me how many people apply  how many people are eager to write  to tell stories. My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non profit called Farafina Trust  and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don't have anything in their libraries  and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops  in reading and writing  for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories. Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign  but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people  but stories can also repair that broken dignity. The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North. She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind.  They sat around  reading the book themselves  listening to me read the book  and a kind of paradise was regained.  I would like to end with this thought  That when we reject the single story  when we realize that there is never a single story about any place  we regain a kind of paradise. Thank you. I want to start with a game. Okay  And to win this game  all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is  all right  So we have two panels here  of colored dots. And one of those dots is the same in the two panels. And you have to tell me which one. Now  I narrowed it down to the gray one  the green one  and  say  the orange one. So by a show of hands  we'll start with the easiest one. Show of hands  how many people think it's the gray one  Really  Okay. How many people think it's the green one  And how many people think it's the orange one  Pretty even split. Let's find out what the reality is. Here is the orange one. Here is the green one. And here is the gray one. So for all of you who saw that  you're complete realists. All right  So this is pretty amazing  isn't it  Because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another. So for us  seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does. And yet  even at this most fundamental level  context is everything. What I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything  but why context is everything. Because it's answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do  but who we are as individuals  and who we are as a society. But first  we have to ask another question  which is   What is color for   And instead of telling you  I'll just show you. What you see here is a jungle scene  and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect. Now  can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you  And if you haven't seen it yet  you're dead  right  Can anyone see it  Anyone  No  Now let's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect. And now you see it. So  color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces  according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect. But what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible. Why  Because  as Berkeley tells us  we have no direct access to our physical world  other than through our senses. And the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world  not only the color of objects  but also the color of their illumination  and the color of the space between us and those objects. You vary any one of those parameters  and you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye. This is a huge problem  because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real world sources. Let me show you what I mean. Imagine that this is the back of your eye  okay  And these are two projections from the world. They're identical in every single way. Identical in shape  size  spectral content. They are the same  as far as your eye is concerned. And yet they come from completely different sources. The one on the right comes from a yellow surface  in shadow  oriented facing the left  viewed through a pinkish medium. The one on the left comes from an orange surface  under direct light  facing to the right  viewed through sort of a bluish medium. Completely different meanings  giving rise to the exact same retinal information. And yet it's only the retinal information that we get. So how on Earth do we even see  So if you remember anything in this next    minutes  remember this  that the light that falls onto your eye  sensory information  is meaningless  because it could mean literally anything. And what's true for sensory information is true for information generally. There's no inherent meaning in information. It's what we do with that information that matters. So  how do we see  Well  we see by learning to see. The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns  finding relationships in information  and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning  a significance  by interacting with the world. We're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes  like language. I'm going to give you some letter strings  and I want you to read them out for me  if you can. Audience   Can you read this    You are not reading this.   What are you reading   Beau Lotto   What are you reading   Half the letters are missing  right  There's no a priori reason why an  H  has to go between that  W  and  A.  But you put one there. Why  Because in the statistics of your past experience  it would have been useful to do so. So you do so again. And yet you don't put a letter after that first  T.  Why  Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past. So you don't do it again. So  let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality  even at the simplest thing the brain does  which is color. So if I could have the lights down up here. I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same. One is simply the flipping of the other. Now I want you to look at that dot between the green and the red. And I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else. We're going to look at it for about    seconds  which is a bit of a killer in an    minute talk. But I really want you to learn. And I'll tell you    don't look anywhere else    I'll tell you what's happening in your head. Your brain is learning  and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination  the left side of its visual field is under green illumination. That's what it's learning. Okay  Now  when I tell you  I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes. So why don't you do that now  Can I have the lights up again  I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore  right  Why  Because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light  and the left one is still under green light. That's your new normal. Okay  So  what does this mean for context  It means I can take two identical squares  put them in light and dark surrounds  and the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround. What's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter. It's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past. So I'll show you what I mean. Here we have that exact same illusion. We have two identical tiles on the left  one in a dark surround  one in a light surround. And the same thing over on the right. Now  I'll reveal those two scenes  but I'm not going to change anything within those boxes  except their meaning. And see what happens to your perception. Notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite  one very white and one very dark  right  Whereas on the right  the two tiles look nearly the same. And yet there is still one on a dark surround  and one on a light surround. Why  Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow  and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow  it would have to be more reflective    just the laws of physics. So you see it that way. Whereas on the right  the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light. If they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye  then they must be equally reflective. So you see it that way. Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions. This is one I made a few years ago. And you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top  and a bright orange tile at the side. That is your perceptual reality. The physical reality is that those two tiles are the same. Here you see four gray tiles on your left  seven gray tiles on the right. I'm not going to change those tiles at all  but I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene. And see what happens to your perception. The four blue tiles on the left are gray. The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray. They are the same. Okay  Don't believe me  Let's watch it again. What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion. So  here we have    let's turn this around    a diamond. And what I'm going to do is  I'm going to hold it here  and I'm going to spin it. And for all of you  you'll see it probably spinning this direction. Now I want you to keep looking at it. Move your eyes around  blink  maybe close one eye. And suddenly it will flip  and start spinning the opposite direction. Yes  Raise your hand if you got that. Yes  Keep blinking. Every time you blink  it will switch. So I can ask you  which direction is it rotating  How do you know  Your brain doesn't know  because both are equally likely. So depending on where it looks  it flips between the two possibilities. Are we the only ones that see illusions  The answer to this question is no. Even the beautiful bumblebee  with its mere one million brain cells  which is     times fewer cells than you have in one retina  sees illusions  does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do. So in my lab we work on bumblebees  because we can completely control their experience  and see how it alters the architecture of their brain. We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix. Here you have the hive. You can see the queen bee  the large bee in the middle. Those are her daughters  the eggs. They go back and forth between this hive and the arena  via this tube. You'll see one of the bees come out here. You see how she has a little number on her  There's another one coming out  she also has a number on her. Now  they're not born that way  right  We pull them out  put them in the fridge  and they fall asleep. Then you can superglue little numbers on them. And now  in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers. They land on the flower  stick their tongue in there  called a proboscis  and drink sugar water. She's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I  will do that about three times  then fly. And sometimes they learn not to go to the blue  but to go where the other bees go. So they copy each other. They can count to five. They can recognize faces. And here she comes down the ladder. And she'll come into the hive  find an empty honey pot  and throw up  and that's honey. Now remember  she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers  but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner  It looks like they're going to green flowers. Now  are they getting it wrong  And the answer to the question is no. Those are actually blue flowers. But those are blue flowers under green light. So they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle  which is exactly what we do. So  illusions are often used  especially in art  in the words of a more contemporary artist   to demonstrate the fragility of our senses.  Okay  this is complete rubbish. The senses aren't fragile. And if they were  we wouldn't be here. Instead  color tells us something completely different  that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is. We can't. Instead  the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past. And how we see is by continually redefining normality. So  how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently  Well  one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound  and we enable people to hear their visual world. And they can navigate the world using their ears. Here's David on the right  and he's holding a camera. On the left is what his camera sees. And you'll see there's a faint line going across that image. That line is broken up into    squares. In each square  we calculate the average color. And then we just simply translate that into sound. And now he's going to turn around  close his eyes  and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed. Beau Lotto  He finds it. Amazing  right  So not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired  but we can also investigate how people literally make sense of the world. But we can also do something else. We can also make music with color. So  working with kids  they created images  thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them. And then we translated these images. And this is one of those images. And this is a six year old child composing a piece of music for a    piece orchestra. And this is what it sounds like. So  a six year old child. Okay  Now  what does all this mean  What this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature  okay  We're not defined by our central properties  by the bits that make us up. We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment  by our ecology. And that ecology is necessarily relative  historical and empirical. So  what I'd like to finish with is this over here. Because what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty. Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding. So  if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain  I'd like to do this one. So  if we have the lights down. And what we have here    Can everyone see    purple surfaces on your left  and     call it yellowish  surfaces on your right  So now  what I want to do  I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination  by simply putting a filter behind them. Now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there  right  Because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter. I'm going to do the opposite on the left here. I'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light. Now  some of you will have noticed that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right  or your left  is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right. Agreed  Yes  Okay. So they are physically the same. Let's pull the covers off. Now remember    you know that the middle nine are exactly the same. Do they look the same  No. The question is   Is that an illusion   And I'll leave you with that. So  thank you very much. So  I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves  but first I want to tell you why I'm here. I'm here for two reasons. These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren. When Ford was about three years old  we shared a very small room together  in a very small space. My office was on one half of the bedroom  and his bedroom was on the other half. And you can imagine  if you're a writer  that things would get really crowded around deadlines. So when Wren was on the way  I realized I needed to find a space of my own. There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard  and without any previous building experience  and about       dollars and some recycled materials  I built this space. It had everything I needed. It was quiet. There was enough space. And I had control  which was very important. As I was building this space  I thought to myself   Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own.  So I did some research. And I found that there was an historic precedence. Hemingway had his writing space. Elvis had two or three manspaces  which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland. In the popular culture  Superman had the Fortress of Solitude  and there was  of course  the Batcave. So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now. Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin  Texas  which is where I'm from. On the outside it looks like a very typical garage  a nice garage. But on the inside  it's anything but. And this  to me  is a pretty classic manspace. It has neon concert posters  a bar and  of course  the leg lamp  which is very important. I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside. This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard  out of landscaping timbers  astroturf. And he found the scoreboard in the trash. Here's another outdoor space  a little bit more sophisticated. This a      wooden tugboat  made completely out of Douglas fir. The guy did it all himself. And there is about       square feet of hanging out space inside. So  pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find  which was  quite frankly  a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat screen TVs. There were definitely hang out spots. But some were for working  some were for playing  some were for guys to collect their things. Most of all  I was just surprised with what I was finding. Take this place for example. On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage. This is in Long Island  New York. The only thing that might tip you off is the round window. On the inside it's a recreation of a   th century Japanese tea house. The man imported all the materials from Japan  and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style. It has no nails or screws. All the joints are hand carved and hand scribed. Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood. But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional size boxing ring inside. And so there is a good reason for this. It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough. He won the silver medal for Ireland in the      Olympics  and he trains in this space. He trains other people. And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments  which is another sort of important part about a manspace. So  while this space represents someone's profession  this one certainly represents a passion. It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship. It's a collection of nautical antiques from the     s and     s. Museum quality. So  as I came to the end of my journey  I found over    spaces. And they were unexpected and they were surprising. But they were also    I was really impressed by how personalized they were  and how much work went into them. And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did. And they really loved their professions. And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies. And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do  and who they were. So if you don't have a space of your own  I highly recommend finding one  and getting into it. Thank you very much. The substance of things unseen. Cities  past and future. In Oxford  perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves  or perhaps pass through to another world. Or  in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald   As the moon rose higher  the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes  a fresh green breast of the new world.  My colleagues and I have been working for    years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project. We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen on the afternoon of September   th        when he sailed into New York harbor. And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts  and if I have time still  an epilogue. So  Act I  A Map Found. So  I didn't grow up in New York. I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains  like you see here  in the Red Rock Canyon. And from these early experiences as a child I learned to love landscapes. And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies  I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology. Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals. This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society  which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world. And over the last decade  I traveled to over    countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos. But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City. And on my weekends I would go up  just like all the other tourists  to the top of the Empire State Building  and I'd look down on this landscape  on these ecosystems  and I'd wonder   How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals  How does it work to make habitat for animals like me   I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall  and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them. I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan. I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City. I read that New York City was the first mega city  a city of    million people or more  in     . I started seeing paintings like this. For those of you who are from New York  this is    th street under the West Side Highway. It was once a beach. And this painting has John James Audubon  the painter  sitting on the rock. And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook  where the George Washington Bridge goes across today. Or this painting  from the     s  from Greenwich Village. Those are two students at King's College    later Columbia University    sitting on a hill  overlooking a valley. And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill  and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree. What's that palm tree doing there  So  it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map. And it's this map you see here. It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in. This map isn't from Hudson's time  but from the American Revolution      years later  made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City. And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew. And it's    feet long and three and a half feet wide. And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan you can see the extent of New York City as it was  right at the end of the American Revolution. Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway. And this is City Hall Park. So the city basically extended to City Hall Park. And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished  things that have disappeared. This is the Collect Pond  which was the fresh water source for New York City for its first     years  and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that. You can see the Lispenard Meadows draining down through here  through what is TriBeCa now  and the beaches that come up from the Battery  all the way to   nd St. This map was made for military reasons. They're mapping the roads  the buildings  these fortifications that they built. But they're also mapping things of ecological interest  also military interest  the hills  the marshes  the streams. This is Richmond Hill  and Minetta Water  which used to run its way through Greenwich Village. Or the swamp at Gramercy Park  right here. Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill      years ago. Here is Times Square  the two streams that came together to make a wetland in Times Square  as it was at the end of the American Revolution. So I saw this remarkable map in a book. And I thought to myself   You know  if I could georeference this map  if I could place this map in the grid of the city today  I could find these lost features of the city  in the block by block geography that people know  the geography of where people go to work  and where they go to live  and where they like to eat.  So  after some work we were able to georeference it  which allows us to put the modern streets on the city  and the buildings  and the open spaces  so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is. We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams  and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today. So this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography. But I had another idea about this map. If we take away the streets  and if we take away the buildings  and if we take away the open spaces  then we could take this map. If we pull off the   th century features we could drive it back in time. We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals  to the hills  to the streams  to the basic hydrology and shoreline  to the beaches  the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape. Then  if we added maps like the geology  the bedrock geology  and the surface geology  what the glaciers leave  if we make the soil map  with the    soil classes  that are defined by the National Conservation Service  if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were  then we can calculate the slopes. We can calculate the aspect. We can calculate the winter wind exposure    so  which way the winter winds blow across the landscape. The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds. We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were  the Lenape. And we built a probability map of where they might have been. So  the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan  places that are close to water  places that are near the harbor to fish  places protected from the winter winds. We know that there was a Lenape settlement down here by the Collect Pond. And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture  that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn  beans  and squash  the  Three Sisters  garden. So  we built a model that explains where those fields might have been. And the old fields  the successional fields that go. And we might think of these as abandoned. But  in fact  they're grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants. And they have become successional shrub lands  and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities. And it turns out that Manhattan had    different ecosystem types. You can think of these as neighborhoods  as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood    that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities  the beaches. And    is a lot. On a per area basis  Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does  than Yellowstone  than Amboseli. It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity. So  Act II  A Home Reconstructed. So  we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees  the    different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan  the Heath hens  the species that aren't there anymore  the beavers on all the streams  the black bears  and the Native Americans  to study how they used and thought about their landscape. We wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs. Where do they get their food  Where do they get their water  Where do they get their shelter  Where do they get their reproductive resources  To an ecologist  the intersection of these is habitat  but to most people  the intersection of these is their home. So  we would read in field guides  the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves  you know  what beavers need is   A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows  near the water.  That's the best thing for a beaver. So we just started making a list. Here is the beaver. And here is the stream  and the aspen and the alder and the willow. As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver. Or the bog turtle  needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places. Or the bobcat  needing rabbits and beavers and den sites. And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs. But a beaver also needs things. And that having it on either side means that we can link it together  that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species. Moreover  we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist  but you can look up what an aspen needs. An aspen needs fire and dry soils. And you can look at what a wet meadow needs. And it need beavers to create the wetlands  and maybe some other things. But you can also talk about sunny places. So  what does a sunny place need  Not habitat per se. But what are the conditions that make it possible  Or fire. Or dry soils. And that you can put these on a grid that's       columns long across the top and       rows down the other way. And then we can visualize this data like a network  like a social network. And this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan  and everything they needed  going back to the geology  going back to time and space at the very core of the web. We call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this. Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type. And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together. They are the connections that actually make nature resilient. And the structure of this is what makes nature work  seen with all its parts. We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish American naturalist John Muir  who said   When we try to pick out anything by itself  we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken  to everything in the universe.  So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps. So if we wanted to go between   th and   th  and Lex and Third  maybe there was a stream in that block. And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there  and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses  the butterflies  the fish in the stream  the birds in the trees. Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there. And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there. And then we took this data. You can see this for yourself on our website. You can zoom into any block on Manhattan  and see what might have been there     years ago. And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III. We used the tools they use in Hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies. And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue. So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography. We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters  and illuminate the landscape. We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities. And feed into that the map of the species. So that we would actually take a photograph  flying above Times Square  looking toward the Hudson River  waiting for Hudson to come. Using this technology  we can make these fantastic georeferenced views. We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like     years ago. This is the view from the East River  looking up Murray Hill at where the United Nations is today. This is the view looking down the Hudson River  with Manhattan on the left  and New Jersey out on the right  looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean. This is the view over Times Square  with the beaver pond there  looking out toward the east. So we can see the Collect Pond  and Lispenard Marshes back behind. We can see the fields that the Native Americans made. And we can see this in the geography of the city today. So when you're watching  Law and Order   and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House  right into the Collect Pond      years ago. So these images are the work of my friend and colleague  Mark Boyer  who is here in the audience today. And I'd just like  if you would give him a hand  to call out for his fine work. There is such power in bringing science and visualization together  that we can create images like this  perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass. And even though I've only had a brief time to speak  I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place. The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity. It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world. But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place on the right  which I quite do. I've come to love the city and its kind of diversity  and its resilience  and its dependence on density and how we're connected together. In fact  that I see them as reflections of each other  much as Lewis Carroll did in  Through the Looking Glass.  We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time  that they really are the same place  that there is no way that cities can escape from nature. And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future. So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue  not about the past  but about     years from now  what we're realizing is that cities are habitats for people  and need to supply what people need  a sense of home  food  water  shelter  reproductive resources  and a sense of meaning. This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity. And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning  about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways  through technology  through art  through science  so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives  that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter  and what we need to raise the kids. So  how can we envision the city of the future  Well  what if we go to Madison Square Park  and we imagine it without all the cars  and bicycles instead and large forests  and streams instead of sewers and storm drains  What if we imagined the Upper East Side with green roofs  and streams winding through the city  and windmills supplying the power we need  Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area  currently home to    million people  but    million people in the future  perhaps living at the density of Manhattan  in only    percent of the area  with the areas in between covered by farmland  covered by wetlands  covered by the marshes we need. This is the kind of future I think we need  is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan  but that learns from the sustainability of the past  of the ecology  the original ecology  of nature with all its parts. Thank you very much. I'm Dr. David Hanson  and I build robots with character. And by that  I mean that I develop robots that are characters  but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you. So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces  make eye contact with you  make a full range of facial expressions  understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are  and build a relationship with you. I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved  on lower power  which enabled the walking biped robots  the first androids. So  it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face  running on very small batteries  extremely lightweight. The materials that allowed the battery operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber  and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen. One is hierarchical pores  and the other is a macro molecular nanoscale porosity in the material. There he's starting to walk. This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. I built the head. They built the body. So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines  and not just sentience  but empathy. We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego. They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions  what facial expressions you're making. It also recognizes where you're looking  your head orientation. We're emulating all the major facial expressions  and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine. And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that. In fact  right now    plug it from here  and then plug it in here  and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions. Okay. So I'm smiling. Now I'm frowning. And this is really heavily backlit. Okay  here we go. Oh  it's so sad. Okay  so you smile  frowning. So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic. Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing. Right  Those machines have no place for empathy. And there is billions of dollars being spent on that. Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy. So  if they achieve human level intelligence or  quite possibly  greater than human levels of intelligence  this could be the seeds of hope for our future. So  we've made    robots in the last eight years  during the course of getting my Ph.D. And then I started Hanson Robotics  which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing. This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago. And it sees multiple people in a scene  remembers where individual people are  and looks from person to person  remembering people. So  we're involving two things. One  the perception of people  and two  the natural interface  the natural form of the interface  so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot. You start to believe that it's alive and aware. So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick  who wrote great works like   Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep   which was the basis of the movie  Bladerunner.  In these stories  robots often think that they're human  and they sort of come to life. So we put his writings  letters  his interviews  correspondences  into a huge database of thousands of pages  and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him. And it was kind of spooky  because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you. And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing  which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence  friendly machine intelligence. And we're getting this mass manufactured. We specked it out to actually be doable with a very  very low cost bill of materials  so that it can become a childhood companion for kids. Interfacing with the Internet  it gets smarter over the years. As artificial intelligence evolves  so does his intelligence. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much. That's incredible. This is my first time at TED. Normally  as an advertising man  I actually speak at TED Evil  which is TED's secret sister that pays all the bills. It's held every two years in Burma. And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again. But  actually  it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business  that what we create in advertising  which is intangible value    you might call it perceived value  you might call it badge value  subjective value  intangible value of some kind    gets rather a bad rap. If you think about it  if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods  you basically have two choices. You can either live in a world which is poorer  which people in general don't like. Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value  that actually intangible value  in many ways is a very  very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things. Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris. The question was given to a bunch of engineers  about    years ago   How do we make the journey to Paris better   And they came up with a very good engineering solution  which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from London to the coast  and knocking about    minutes off a three and half hour journey time. Now  call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ... ... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter. Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks  Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion. What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels  pay them to walk the length of the train  handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey. Now  you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change  and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down. Now  here is another naive advertising man's question again. And this shows that engineers  medical people  scientific people  have an obsession with solving the problems of reality  when actually most problems  once you reach a basic level of wealth in society  most problems are actually problems of perception. So I'll ask you another question. What on earth is wrong with placebos  They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop. They work extraordinarily well. They have no side effects  or if they do  they're imaginary  so you can safely ignore them. So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it. Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further  and actually produce placebo education. The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things. It actually works by giving you the impression that you've had a very good education  which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self confidence  which then makes you very  very successful in later life. So  welcome to Oxford  ladies and gentlemen. But  actually  the point of placebo education is interesting. How many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception  rather than that tedious  hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality  Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings  but doing a bit of historical research  it seems to be Fredrick the Great. Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very  very keen for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it  because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate  wheat and potatoes  you get less price volatility in bread. And you get a far lower risk of famine  because you actually had two crops to fall back on  not one. The only problem is  potatoes  if you think about it  look pretty disgusting. And also    th century Prussians ate very  very few vegetables    rather like contemporary Scottish people. So  actually  he tried making it compulsory. The Prussian peasantry said   We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things. They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing.  There are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes. So he tried plan B. He tried the marketing solution  which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable  and none but the royal family could consume it. And he planted it in a royal potato patch  with guards who had instructions to guard over it  night and day  but with secret instructions not to guard it very well. Now    th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life  which is if something is worth guarding  it's worth stealing. Before long  there was a massive underground potato growing operation in Germany. What he'd effectively done is he'd re branded the potato. It was an absolute masterpiece. I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said   Very  very good marketer  Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk.  Ataturk  rather like Nicolas Sarkozy  was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil  in Turkey  to modernize it. Now  boring people would have just simply banned the veil. But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance. Ataturk was a lateral thinker. He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil. I can't verify that fully  but it does not matter. There is your environmental problem solved  by the way  guys  All convicted child molesters have to drive a Porsche Cayenne. What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things. Which is that  actually  first one  all value is actually relative. All value is perceived value. For those of you who don't speak Spanish  jugo de naranja    it's actually the Spanish for  orange juice.  Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists. As an advertising man  I have to admire that. But the first thing is that all value is subjective. Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion. These funny signs that flash your speed at you  some of the new ones  on the bottom right  now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face  to act as an emotional trigger. What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about    percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera  but they prevent twice as many accidents. So  the bizarre thing  which is baffling to conventional  classically trained economists  is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a     fine and three penalty points. Tiny little behavioral economics detail  in Italy  penalty points go backwards. You start with    and they take them away. Because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people's behavior. In Britain we tend to feel   Whoa  Got another three   Not so in Italy. Another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value  which remember  is what  after all  the environmental movement needs to be about  This again is from Prussia  from  I think  about           . The wealthy Prussians  to help in the war against the French  were encouraged to give in all their jewelry. And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron. Here's one   Gold gab ich f r Eisen      .  The interesting thing is that for    years hence  the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds. It was made of cast iron. Because actually  never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry. This actually had symbolic value  badge value. It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past. So  the modern equivalent would of course be this. But  actually  there is a thing  just as there are Veblen goods  where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare    there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous  classless and minimalistic. If you think about it  Shakerism was a proto environmental movement. Adam Smith talks about   th century America  where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great  it was almost a block in the economy in New England  because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors. It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies. What's also interesting  if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value  a high component of intangible value  versus their intrinsic value  They are often quite egalitarian. In terms of dress  denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value. Coca Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos  and you may not like the Coca Cola company  but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke. What Warhol said about Coke is  he said   What I really like about Coca Cola is the president of the United States can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street.  Now  that is  actually  when you think about it    we take it for granted    it's actually a remarkable achievement  to produce something that's that democratic. Now  we basically have to change our views slightly. There is a basic view that real value involves making things  involves labor. It involves engineering. It involves limited raw materials. And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version. And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it. It patently veers toward propaganda. However  what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value  and it's much fairer. When I grew up  this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food. You had a monopoly supplier. On the left  you have Rupert Murdoch  or the BBC. And on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it. Nowadays  the user is actually involved. This is actually what's called  in the digital world   user generated content.  Although it's called agriculture in the world of food. This is actually called a mash up  where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it. In the world of food we call it cooking. This is food  .   which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people. This is mobile food. British are very good at that. Fish and chips in newspaper  the Cornish Pasty  the pie  the sandwich. We invented the whole lot of them. We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food  but it's not very portable  generally. I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich. He actually invented the toasty. But then  the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name. Finally  we have contextual communication. Now  the reason I show you Pernod    it's only one example. Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod. It tastes great within the borders of that country  but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else. Unicum in Hungary  for example. The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina  which even tastes shite when you're in Greece. But so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people  for giving them better information    B.J. Fogg  at the University of Stanford  makes the point that actually the mobile phone is    He's invented the phrase   persuasive technologies.  He believes the mobile phone  by being location specific  contextual  timely and immediate  is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented. Now  if we have all these tools at our disposal  we simply have to ask the question  and Thaler and Sunstein have  of how we can use these more intelligently. I'll give you one example. If you had a large red button of this kind  on the wall of your home  and every time you pressed it  it saved    dollars for you  put    dollars into your pension  you would save a lot more. The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior. Okay  Now  marketing has done a very  very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying. Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving. If you did this  more people would save more. It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions  and the very nature of the decisions changes. Obviously  I don't want people to do this  because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed. But if anybody did want to do that  that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about  actually  fundamental opportunities to change human behavior. Now  I've got an example here from Canada. There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada called Hunter Somerville  who was working in improv in Toronto  and got a part time job in advertising  and was given the job of advertising Shreddies. Now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible  added value  without changing the product in the slightest. Shreddies is a strange  square  whole grain cereal  only available in New Zealand  Canada and Britain. It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown. In working out how you could re launch Shreddies  he came up with this. Video   Buzzer  Man  Shreddies is supposed to be square. Woman  Have any of these diamond shapes gone out  Voiceover  New Diamond Shreddies cereal. Same     percent whole grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape. Rory Sutherland  I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example of intangible value creation. All it requires is photons  neurons  and a great idea to create this thing. I would say it's a work of genius. But  naturally  you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research. Man  So  Shreddies is actually producing a new product  which is something very exciting for them. So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies. So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that  when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there. Woman  Weren't they square  Woman     I'm a little bit confused. Woman     They look like the squares to me. Man  They    Yeah  it's all in the appearance. But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six  if you flip it over it looks like a nine. But a six is very different from a nine. Woman      Or an  M  and a  W . Man  An  M  and a  W   exactly. Man      unclear  You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that it's more interesting looking. Man  Just try both of them. Take a square one there  first. Man  Which one did you prefer  Man     The first one. Man  The first one  Rory Sutherland  Now  naturally  a debate raged. There were conservative elements in Canada  unsurprisingly  who actually resented this intrusion. So  eventually  the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise  which was the combo pack. If you think it's funny  bear in mind there is an organization called the American Institute of Wine Economics  which actually does extensive research into perception of things  and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people  there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine  except when you tell the people how expensive it is  in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more. So drink your wine blind in the future. But this is both hysterically funny    but I think an important philosophical point  which is  going forward  we need more of this kind of value. We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists  and less time agonizing over what else we can do. Two quotations to more or less end with. One of them is   Poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new.  Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is  to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar  but also to gain a greater appreciation  and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing. There is some evidence  by the way  that things like social networking help do that. Because they help people share news. They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities. So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display  and increase the kind of third party enjoyment you can get from the smallest  simplest things in life. Which is magic. The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session  which is   We are perishing for want of wonder  not for want of wonders   which I think for anybody involved in technology  is perfectly true. And a final thing  When you place a value on things like health  love  sex and other things  and learn to place a material value on what you've previously discounted for being merely intangible  a thing not seen  you realize you're much  much wealthier than you ever imagined. Thank you very much indeed. Our mission is to build a detailed  realistic computer model of the human brain. And we've done  in the past four years  a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain  and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain. Why are we doing this  There are three important reasons. The first is  it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society  and I think that it is a key step in evolution. The second reason is  we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever  and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model. It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive. And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder  and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical. I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders. Now  even at this stage  we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works. And here  at TED  for the first time  I'd like to share with you how we're addressing one theory    there are many theories    one theory of how the brain works. So  this theory is that the brain creates  builds  a version of the universe  and projects this version of the universe  like a bubble  all around us. Now  this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries. But  for the first time  we can actually address this  with brain simulation  and ask very systematic and rigorous questions  whether this theory could possibly be true. The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out         kilometers. It runs out of space. And so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble  and we make a decision. We make a decision it's that big  even though it's not that big. And what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive. Without decisions you cannot see  you cannot think  you cannot feel. And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep  or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain  but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way. What they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other. They are confused  and you cannot make a decision. So  while you're trying to make up your mind what the doctor  the surgeon  is doing while he's hacking away at your body  he's long gone. He's at home having tea. So  when you walk up to a door and you open it  what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions  thousands of decisions about the size of the room  the walls  the height  the objects in this room.    percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes. It is what you infer about that room. So I can say  with some certainty   I think  therefore I am.  But I cannot say   You think  therefore you are   because  you  are within my perceptual bubble. Now  we can speculate and philosophize this  but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years. We can ask a very concrete question.  Can the brain build such a perception   Is it capable of doing it  Does it have the substance to do it  And that's what I'm going to describe to you today. So  it took the universe    billion years to build the brain. It had to improve it a little bit. It had to add to the frontal part  so that you would have instincts  because they had to cope on land. But the real big step was the neocortex. It's a new brain. You needed it. The mammals needed it because they had to cope with parenthood  social interactions  complex cognitive functions. So  you can think of the neocortex actually as the ultimate solution today  of the universe as we know it. It's the pinnacle  it's the final product that the universe has produced. It was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons  to produce this almost frightening organ  structure. And it has not stopped its evolutionary path. In fact  the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed. If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex  you discover that it's made up of little modules  G  processors  like in a computer. But there are about a million of them. They were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull. And the brain started to fold in on itself  and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted. We're just packing in columns  so that we'd have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions. So you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano  a million key grand piano. Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note. You stimulate it  it produces a symphony. But it's not just a symphony of perception. It's a symphony of your universe  your reality. Now  of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys. That's why you have to send your kids to good schools  hopefully eventually to Oxford. But it's not only education. It's also genetics. You may be born lucky  where you know how to master your neocortical column  and you can play a fantastic symphony. In fact  there is a new theory of autism called the  intense world  theory  which suggests that the neocortical columns are super columns. They are highly reactive  and they are super plastic  and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us. But you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns  the note is going to be off. The perception  the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted  and you will have symptoms of disease. So  the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column    and it's not just for neuroscience  it's perhaps to understand perception  to understand reality  and perhaps to even also understand physical reality. So  what we did was  for the past    years  was to dissect out the neocortex  systematically. It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest. How many trees does it have  What shapes are the trees  How many of each type of tree do you have  Where are they positioned  But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication  the rules of connectivity  because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron. They choose very carefully who they connect with. It's also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three dimensional digital models of them. And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons  built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across. And once you have that  you can actually begin to build the neocortical column. And here we're coiling them up. But as you do this  what you see is that the branches intersect actually in millions of locations  and at each of these intersections they can form a synapse. And a synapse is a chemical location where they communicate with each other. And these synapses together form the network or the circuit of the brain. Now  the circuit  you could also think of as the fabric of the brain. And when you think of the fabric of the brain  the structure  how is it built  What is the pattern of the carpet  You realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain  and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet  out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern. The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversity. Every neuron is different. It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different. You may have many different types of trees  but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same. So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another  and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours. And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way. And you may have more or less neurons. So it's very unlikely that you got the same fabric  the same circuitry. So  how could we possibly create a reality that we can even understand each other  Well  we don't have to speculate. We can look at all    million synapses now. We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons. We can use different neurons with different variations. We can position them in different places  orient them in different places. We can use less or more of them. And when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change. But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not. So  the fabric of the brain  even though your brain may be smaller  bigger  it may have different types of neurons  different morphologies of neurons  we actually do share the same fabric. And we think this is species specific  which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species. So  let's switch it on. But to do it  what you have to do is you have to make this come alive. We make it come alive with equations  a lot of mathematics. And  in fact  the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates. So  we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive. We also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information  and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other. And when they get to the synapse  what they do is they effectively  literally  shock the synapse. It's like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses. And we've got the mathematics to describe this process. So we can describe the communication between the neurons. There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex. But what you do need is a very big computer. And in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron. So you need        laptops. So where do you go  You go to IBM  and you get a supercomputer  because they know how to take        laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator. So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer. We can load up all the neurons  each one on to its processor  and fire it up  and see what happens. Take the magic carpet for a ride. Here we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation. It's the first view. Now  when you look at that the first time  you think   My god. How is reality coming out of that   But  in fact  you can start  even though we haven't trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality. But we can ask   Where is the rose   We can ask   Where is it inside  if we stimulate it with a picture   Where is it inside the neocortex  Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it. So  the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons  ignore the synapses  and look just at the raw electrical activity. Because that is what it's creating. It's creating electrical patterns. So when we did this  we indeed  for the first time  saw these ghost like structures  electrical objects appearing within the neocortical column. And it's these electrical objects that are holding all the information about whatever stimulated it. And then when we zoomed into this  it's like a veritable universe. So the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space. And if you do that  you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this machine  by this piece of the brain. So  in summary  I think that the universe may have    it's possible    evolved a brain to see itself  which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself. There is a lot more to do to test these theories  and to test any other theories. But I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain. We can do it within    years  and if we do succeed  we will send to TED  in    years  a hologram to talk to you. Thank you. Over the next five minutes  my intention is to transform your relationship with sound. Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental  and much of it is unpleasant.  Traffic noise  We stand on street corners  shouting over noise like this  and pretending that it doesn't exist. Well  this habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious. There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time  and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today. First is physiological.  Loud alarm clocks  Sorry about that. I've just given you a shot of cortisol  your fight flight hormone. Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time  but also your breathing  your heart rate    which I just also did    and your brainwaves. It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it. This is surf.  Ocean waves  It has the frequency of roughly    cycles per minute. Most people find that very soothing  and  interestingly     cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human. There is a deep resonance with being at rest. We also associate it with being stress free and on holiday. The second way in which sound affects you is psychological. Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state.  Albinoni's Adagio  This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on. Music is not the only kind of sound  however  which affects your emotions. Natural sound can do that too. Birdsong  for example  is a sound which most people find reassuring.  Birds chirping  There is a reason for that. Over hundreds of thousands of years we've learned that when the birds are singing  things are safe. It's when they stop you need to be worried. The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively. You can't understand two people talking at once   If you're listening to this version of   Try and listen to the other one.   You have to choose which me you're going to listen to.   We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input  which is why noise like this     Office noise     is extremely damaging for productivity. If you have to work in an open plan office like this  your productivity is greatly reduced. And whatever number you're thinking of  it probably isn't as bad as this. You are one third as productive in open plan offices as in quiet rooms. And I have a tip for you. If you have to work in spaces like that  carry headphones with you  with a soothing sound like birdsong. Put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be. The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally. With all that other stuff going on  it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change. at a steady    miles per hour  I don't think so. At the simplest  you move away from unpleasant sound and towards pleasant sounds. So if I were to play this     Jackhammer     for more than a few seconds  you'd feel uncomfortable  for more than a few minutes  you'd be leaving the room in droves. For people who can't get away from noise like that  it's extremely damaging for their health. And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages. Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental  and even hostile  and it has a dramatic effect on sales. For those of you who are retailers  you may want to look away before I show this slide. They are losing up to    percent of their business with people leaving shops faster  or just turning around on the door. We all have done it  leaving the area because the sound in there is so dreadful. I want to spend just a moment talking about the model that we've developed  which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound  analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I've just talked about. Or start at the bottom  and say what outcomes do we want  and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect. At last we've got some science we can apply. And we're in the business of designing soundscapes. Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is  often inappropriately deployed. It's powerful for two reasons. You recognize it fast  and you associate it very powerfully. I'll give you two examples.  First chord of The Beatles'  A Hard Day's Night   Most of you recognize that immediately. The younger  maybe not.  Laughter  Now  those are one second samples of music. Music is very powerful. And unfortunately it's veneering commercial spaces  often inappropriately. I hope that's going to change over the next few years. Let me just talk about brands for a moment  because some of you run brands. Every brand is out there making sound right now. There are eight expressions of a brand in sound. They are all important. And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center. I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now. You all recognize that one.  Nokia ringtone  This is the most played tune in the world today.  .  billion times a day  that tune is played. And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing. Just leave you with four golden rules  for those of you who run businesses  for commercial sound. First  make it congruent  pointing in the same direction as your visual communication. That increases impact by over       percent. If your sound is pointing the opposite direction  incongruent  you reduce impact by    percent. That's an order of magnitude  up or down. This is important. Secondly  make it appropriate to the situation. Thirdly  make it valuable. Give people something with the sound. Don't just bombard them with stuff. And  finally  test and test it again. Sound is complex. There are many countervailing influences. It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti  sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens. So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness. If you're listening consciously  you can take control of the sound around you. It's good for your health. It's good for your productivity. If we all do that we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world. I'm going to leave you with a little bit more birdsong.  Birds chirping  I recommend at least five minutes a day  but there is no maximum dose. Thank you for lending me your ears today. Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years. We've questioned the future of capitalism. We've questioned the financial industry. We've looked at our government oversight. We've questioned where we're going. And yet  at the same time  this very well may be a seminal moment in American history  an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America. I'm calling this The Great Unwind. And the idea is a simple  simple idea  which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action. Consumers who represent    percent of the GDP of America have actually started  just like banks and just like businesses  to de leverage  to unwind their leverage  in daily life  to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward. So  to understand this    and I'm going to stress this    it's not about the consumer being in retreat. The consumer is empowered. In order to understand this  we're going to step back and look a little bit at what's happened over the course of the last year and a half. So  if you've been gone  this is the easy CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy. Okay  Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down. Commodity prices are like this. If you're a mom trying to manage a budget  and oil was     dollars a barrel last summer  and it's somewhere between    and     do you plan vacations  How do you buy  What is your strategy in your household  Will the bailout work  We have national debt  Detroit  currency valuations  healthcare  all these issues facing us. You put them all together  you mix them up in a bouillabaisse  and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time bomb. In fact  let's go back and look at what caused this crisis  because the consumer  all of us  in our daily lives  actually contributed a large part to the problem. This is something I call the       paradox. It took us    years to reach annual savings ratings of almost    percent.    years. Do you know what this was right here  This was World War II. Do you know why savings was so high  There was nothing to buy  unless you wanted to buy some rivets. Right  So  what happened though  over the course of the last    years    we went from a    percent savings rate to a negative savings rate. Because we binged. We bought extra large cars  supersized everything  we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome. All these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today. The personal debt to income ratio basically went from    percent to     percent in the span of about    years. So consumers got overleveraged. And of course our banks did as well  as did our federal government. This is an absolutely staggering chart. It shows leverage  trended out from      to     . And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education  future children in our households. So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout  what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills  first of all          dollars is about the size of a five foot four guy. But if you stack it up  you just see this amazing  staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out. So this is the first     billion. But I read this fact the other day  that one trillion seconds equals    thousand years  so if you think about that  the context  the casualness with which we talk about trillion dollar bailout here  and trillion there  we are stacking ourselves up for long term leverage. However  consumers have moved. They are taking responsibility. What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate. In fact     straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis. We are working our way back up to that    percent. Also  remarkably  in the fourth quarter  spending dropped to its lowest level in    years  almost a  .  percent decline. Visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than they're using credit cards. So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have. And we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest. But that's not really the whole story. Because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation. And you've got to admit  over the course of the last year and a half  consumers have been doing some pretty weird things. It's been pretty staggering  what we've lived through. If you take into account    percent of all Americans were born after World War II  this is essentially our Depression. And so  as a result  some crazy things have happened. I'll give you some examples. Lets talk about dentists  vasectomies  guns and shark attacks. Okay  Dentists report molars  you know  people grinding their teeth  coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress. And so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced. Guns  gun sales  according to the FBI  who does background checks  are up almost    percent since January. Vasectomies are up    percent  according to the Cornell institute. And lastly  but a very good point  hopefully not related to the former point I just made  which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from     . Does anybody know why  No one is at the beach. So there is a bright side to everything. But seriously  what we see happening  and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat  is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out. And what I mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption. Right  If you think about the last three decades  the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '  s  to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade  but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate. By restricting their demand  consumers can actually align their values with their spending  and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more  but be about better. We're going to explain that right now. Based on Y R's BrandAsset Valuator  proprietary tool of VML and Young   Rubicam  we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace. We found a couple of really interesting things. We're going to go through four value shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors  that offer new management principles. The first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life. This is the movement from Americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity  because the less excess that you have around you  the more nimble and fleet of foot you are. As a result  d class  consumption is in. D class  consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti fashion. The management principle is dollars and cents. So let's look at some examples of this d class  consumption that falls out of this value. First things is we see something must be happening when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling. But seriously  we also have this phenomenon on Madison Avenue and in other places  where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary  sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases. We see high end haggling in fashion today. High end haggling for luxury and real estate. We also see just a relaxing of ego  and sort of a dismantling of artifice. This is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar. Blue collar yacht club  where you can join the yacht club  but you've got to work in the boat yard  as sort of condition of membership. We also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low key. Right  Agritourism  going to vineyards and going to farms. And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents. What businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting. A couple things that are kind of cool. One is that Frito Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer. They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month  less at the end of the month. So what they did is they started to change their packaging. Larger packs at the beginning of the month  smaller packaging at the end of the month. Really interestingly  too  was the San Francisco Giants. They've just instituted dynamic pricing. So it takes into account everything from the pitcher match ups  to the weather  to the team records  in setting prices for the consumer. Another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga. Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed cost. Again  this theme is about variable cost  variable living. So micropayments have become huge. And lastly  some people are using Hulu actually as a device to get rid of their cable bill. So  really clever ideas there that are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand. The second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play. We see that play itself out with empathy and respect. The consumer is demanding it. And  as a result  businesses must provide not only value  but values. Increasingly  consumers are looking at the culture of the company  looking for their conduct in the marketplace. So  what we see with empathy and respect  lots of really hopeful things that have come out of this recession. And I'll give you a few examples. One is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods  and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system. Also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing  which has been unemployment  is a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country. We also see the phenomenon    some of you may have  boomerang kids     these are  boomerang alumni   where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs  sharing skills and retraining. We also talked about character and professionalism. We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City  you know  in January  and suddenly Sully has become a key name on Babycenter. So  from a value and values standpoint  what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways. Microsoft is doing something wonderful. They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with I.T. training  using their existing infrastructure to do something good. Also a really interesting company is Gore Tex. Gore Tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees  to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses. But they also talk about the fact that their executives  all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see. Complete transparency. Think twice before you have that bottle of wine. The third of the four laws of post crisis consumerism is about durable living. We're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon  not a sprint. They are digging in. And they're looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase that they make. Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before   .  years on average  in March. A record. We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America. Did you know that    percent of Americans now carry a library card  The highest percentage ever in our nation's history. So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge. Continuing education is up. Everything is focused on betterment  and training  and development and moving forward. We also see a big DIY movement. I was fascinated to learn that    percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners. That includes cottages and the like. But    percent. So  people are getting their hands dirty. They are rolling up their sleeves. They want these skills. We see that with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens and chickens and ducks. And when you work out the math  they say it doesn't work  but the principle is there that it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself. And then we look at the High Line in New York City  an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good  which is a brand new park in New York City. So  what brands can do  and companies  is pay dividends to consumers  be a brand that lasts  offer transparency  promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale. Perfect example of that is Patagonia. Patagonia's Footprint Chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make  and gives you social responsibility  and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make. Another great example is Fidelity. Rather than instant cash back rewards on your credit or debit purchases  this is about     rewards for your student education. Or the interesting company SunRun. I love this company. They've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer based utility  where the electricity that they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace. So  it's a consumer driven co op. So  the fourth sort of post crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold. It's incredibly important right now. Trust is not parceled out  as we all know. It's now about connecting to your communities  connecting to your social networks. In my book I talked about the fact that    percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company  versus    percent on advertising. So  in that respect  cooperative consumerism has really taken off. This is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace. Let's look at a couple of quick examples. The artisanal movement is huge. Everything about locally derived products and services  supporting your local neighborhoods  whether it's cheeses  wines and other products. Also this rise of local currencies. Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment  you're doing business with people you trust  in your local markets. So  this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon. And then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating. They actually started  in certain communities in the United States  start to publish people's electricity usage. And what they found out is when that was available for public record  the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped. Then we also look at the idea of cow pooling  which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled. And then there is this other really interesting movement that's happened in California  which is about carrot mobs. The traditional thing would be to boycott right  Have a stick  Well why not have a carrot  So these are consumers organizing  pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good. And then we look at what companies can do. This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer. You have to realize that you can't fight and control this. You actually need to organize it. You need to harness it. You need to give it meaning. And there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see. First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants  into actually rating healthcare. So what credentials does Zagat's have  Well  they have a lot  because it's their network of people. Right  So that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic. Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi. This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck. Right  It's a moving truck through L.A.  and the only way you can find it is through Twitter. Or you look at Johnson   Johnson's Momversations. A phenomenal blog that's been built up. Where J J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers  allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect. And it's also become a very  very valuable sort of advertising revenue for J J as well. This plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs from Ford to Zappos  connecting on Twitter  creating an open environment  allowing their employees to be part of the process  rather than hidden behind walls. You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt  all because the consumer is demanding it. So  when we look at this and we step back  what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real. It's been tremendously powerful for consumers. But  at the same time  this is also a tremendous opportunity. And the Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin. Crisis equals opportunity. What we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession. So  we believe that values driven spending will force capitalism to be better. It will drive innovation. It will make longer lasting products. It will create better  more intuitive customer service. It will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share. So  when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data  we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America. Thank you very much. One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo real  digital human face. And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that  unlike aliens and dinosaurs  we look at human faces every day. They are very important to how we communicate with each other. As a result  we're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering  in order to believe whether these things are realistic. And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo realistic computer generated face  using some computer graphics technology we've developed  and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics. And we're going to try to do a photo real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien  who is right there. And that's actually a completely computer generated rendering of her face. By the end of the talk  we're going to see it move. The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself  who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in Marina Del Rey  and sit for a session in Light Stage  . This is a face scanning sphere  with     white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions. And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this. We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds. And we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face  and different principle directions of light from the light stage  to figure out both the coarse scale and the fine scale detail of her face. If we zoom in on this photograph right here  we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her  because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture. And in addition  we've actually used polarizers on all the lights    just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road  polarizers can block the shine off of the skin  so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map. Now  if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit  we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in  and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point. If you take the difference between these two images here  you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily's skin. I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this. And this is very important light to capture  because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin. It doesn't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out. And  as a result  it's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have  the things that actually make us look like real humans. So  if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection  we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape  and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles. And  even more importantly  since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture  we can shoot Emily in just part of an afternoon  in many different facial poses and facial expressions. So  here you can see her moving her eyes around  moving her mouth around. And these we're actually going to use to create a photo real digital character. If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily  you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions. You can see things. Not only the face shape changes  but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs. You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores to the regular skin texture. You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there. You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down. Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that. In addition to this kind of high resolution geometry  since it's all captured with cameras  we've got a great texture map to use for the face. And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination  the red and the green and the blue  diffuse the light differently  we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer. Then  instead of looking like a plaster mannequin  it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh. And this is what we used to give to the company Image Metrics to create a rigged  digital version of Emily. We're just seeing the coarse scale geometry here. But they basically created a digital puppet of her  where you can pull on these various strings  and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took. And  in addition to the coarse scale geometry  they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called  displacement maps  that animate as well. These are the displacement maps here. And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates. So the next process was then to animate her. We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data. So  by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques  they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer generated performance. So what you're going to see now  after this  is a completely photo real digital face. We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available. Emily  Image Metrics is a markerless  performance driven animation company. We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films. Image Metrics is a markerless  performance driven animation company. We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films. Paul Debevec  So  if we break that down into layers  here's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide. Here is the specular component animating. You can see all the wrinkles happening there. And there is the underlying wireframe mesh. And that is Emily herself. Now  where are we going with this here  We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage  . This is Light Stage    and we're looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies. This is Bruce Lawmen  one of our researchers in the group  who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage. And let's take a look at a computer generated version of Bruce  running in a new environment. And thank you very much. The magical moment  the magical moment of conducting. Which is  you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting. They are all  you know  warming up and doing stuff. And I go on the podium. You know  this little office of the conductor. Or rather a cubicle  an open space cubicle  with a lot of space. And in front of all that noise  you do a very small gesture. Something like this  not very pomp  not very sophisticated  this. And suddenly  out of the chaos  order. Noise becomes music. And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting to think that it's all about me. All those great people here  virtuosos  they make noise  they need me to do that. Not really. If it were that  I would just save you the talk  and teach you the gesture. So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want  and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work. Let's look at the first video. I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony. And then speak a little bit about how it comes about. Was that nice  So that was a sort of a success. Now  who should we thank for the success  I mean  obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully  the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. They don't often even look at the conductor. Then you have the clapping audience  yeah  actually taking part in doing the music. You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music. This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna. Unlike  for example Israel  where audiences cough all the time. You know  Arthur Rubinstein  the pianist  used to say that   Anywhere in the world  people that have the flu  they go to the doctor. In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts.  So that's a sort of a tradition. But Viennese audiences do not do that. Here they go out of their regular  just to be part of that  to become part of the orchestra  and that's great. You know  audiences like you  yeah  make the event. But what about the conductor  What can you say the conductor was doing  actually  Um  he was happy. And I often show this to senior management. People get annoyed.  You come to work. How come you're so happy   Something must be wrong there  yeah  But he's spreading happiness. And I think the happiness  the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music. The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time. You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body. You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah. You have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience. And then you have other stories  unseen. People who build this wonderful concert hall. People who made those Stradivarius  Amati  all those beautiful instruments. And all those stories are being heard at the same time. This is the true experience of a live concert. That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah  And not all conductors do just that. Let's see somebody else  a great conductor. Riccardo Muti  please. Yeah  that was very short  but you could see it's a completely different figure. Right  He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah  So clear. Maybe a little bit over clear. Can we have a little demonstration  Would you be my orchestra for a second  Can you sing  please  the first note of Don Giovanni  You have to sing  Aaaaaah   and I'll stop you. Okay  Ready  Audience    Aaaaaaah ...   Itay Talgam  Come on  with me. If you do it without me I feel even more redundant than I already feel. So please  wait for the conductor. Now look at me.  Aaaaaah   and I stop you. Let's go. Audience    ... Aaaaaaaah ...   Itay Talgam  So we'll have a little chat later. But ... There is a vacancy for a ... But     Laughter     you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger. Now what does Riccardo Muti do  He does something like this ... And then    sort of     Laughter  So not only the instruction is clear  but also the sanction  what will happen if you don't do what I tell you. So  does it work  Yes  it works    to a certain point. When Muti is asked   Why do you conduct like this   He says   I'm responsible.  Responsible in front of him. No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart  which is     Laughter     like a third seat from the center. So he says   If I'm    if I'm responsible for Mozart  this is going to be the only story to be told. It's Mozart as I  Riccardo Muti  understand it.  And you know what happened to Muti  Three years ago he got a letter signed by all     employees of La Scala  musical employees  I mean the musicians  saying   You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign.   Why  Because you don't let us develop. You're using us as instruments  not as partners. And our joy of music  etc.  etc. ...  So he had to resign. Isn't that nice  He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy. Well  can you do it with less control  or with a different kind of control  Let's look at the next conductor  Richard Strauss. I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old. It's not true. When he was a young man of about     he wrote what he called  The Ten Commandments for Conductors.  The first one was  If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong. That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better. It says  Never look at the trombones    it only encourages them. So  the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself. Do not interfere. But how does it happen  Did you see him turning pages in the score  Now  either he is senile  and doesn't remember his own music  because he wrote the music. Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them  saying   Come on guys. You have to play by the book. So it's not about my story. It's not about your story. It's only the execution of the written music  no interpretation.  Interpretation is the real story of the performer. So  no  he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control. Let's see another super conductor  a German super conductor. Herbert von Karajan  please. What's different  Did you see the eyes  Closed. Did you see the hands  Did you see this kind of movement  Let me conduct you. Twice. Once like a Muti  and you'll     Claps     clap  just once. And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay  Like Muti. You ready  Because Muti ... Audience   Claps  Itay Talgam  Hmm ... again. Audience   Claps  Itay Talgam  Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained  let me concentrate  close my eyes. Come  come. Audience   Claps   Laughter  Itay Talgam  Why not together   Laughter  Because you didn't know when to play. Now I can tell you  even the Berlin Philharmonic doesn't know when to play. But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism. This is a German orchestra  yes  They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.  Do you understand what this guy wants   And after doing that  they really look at each other  and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together. And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says   Yes  the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction. Because that would prevent the ensemble  the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra.  Now that's great. What about the eyes  Why are the eyes closed  There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London. And he cues in a flute player like this. The guy has no idea what to do.  Laughter   Maestro  with all due respect  when should I start   What do you think Karajan's reply was  When should I start  Oh yeah. He says   You start when you can't stand it anymore.  Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything. It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head. And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure because I don't give you instruction  and yet  you have to guess my mind. So it's a different kind of  a very spiritual but yet very firm control. Can we do it in another way  Of course we can. Let's go back to the first conductor we've seen  Carlos Kleiber  his name. Next video  please. Well  it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way  No  it's not  because he is not telling them what to do. When he does this  it's not   Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix  smash it on the floor.  It's not that. He says   This is the gesture of the music. I'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation.  That is another story. But how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions  It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah  You're not really given any instructions  but the forces of the process itself keep you in place. That's what he does. The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist. It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads. And that's what makes them into partners. You have the plan in your head. You know what to do  even though Kleiber is not conducting you. But here and there and that. You know what to do. And you become a partner building the rollercoaster  yeah  with sound  as you actually take the ride. This is very exciting for those players. They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks  later. It is very tiring. Yeah  But it's the best music making  like this. But of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy. You also have to be very professional. And look again at this Kleiber. Can we have the next video  quickly  You'll see what happens when there is a mistake. And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done. Go along with the video. Look. See  second time for the same player.  Wait for me after the concert. I have a short notice to give you.  You know  when it's needed  the authority is there. It's very important. But authority is not enough to make people your partners. Let's see the next video  please. See what happens here. You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy. He's conducting Mozart. The whole orchestra is playing. Now something else. See  He is there     percent  but not commanding  not telling what to do. Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing. Another solo now. See what you can pick up from this. Look at the eyes. Okay. You see that  First of all  it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get. It's not feedback. It's an  Mmmm ...  Yeah  it comes from here. So that's a good thing. And the second thing is it's about actually being in control  but in a very special way. When Kleiber does    did you see the eyes  going from here   Singing  You know what happens  Gravitation is no more. Kleiber not only creates a process  but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place. So again  the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work  and creative and all of that. And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level. So control is no longer a zero sum game. You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together  in partnership  brings about the best music. So Kleiber is about process. Kleiber is about conditions in the world. But you need to have process and content to create the meaning. Lenny Bernstein  my own personal maestro. Since he was a great teacher  Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this  please. Do you remember the face of Muti  at the beginning  Well he had a wonderful expression  but only one. Did you see Lenny's face  You know why  Because the meaning of the music is pain. And you're playing a painful sound. And you look at Lenny and he's suffering. But not in a way that you want to stop. It's suffering  like  enjoying himself in a Jewish way  as they say. But you can see the music on his face. You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton. Now it's about you  the player  telling the story. Now it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story. And even briefly  you become the storyteller to which the community  the whole community  listens to. And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful  Now  if you are doing all the things we talked about  together  and maybe some others  you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing. And for the last video  I think this is simply the best title. My friend Peter says   If you love something  give it away.  So  please. Twenty five and a quarter years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS  the transmission of AIDS. I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it. Sadly  it's come true. Malaria  as we all know  kills approximately one million people a year. The reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills  .  million people a year. This young girl and her friend that I met in an orphanage in Delhi were HIV positive from a syringe. And what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out    and don't forget  their parents took them to the doctor    the parents threw them out on the street. And hence they ended up in an orphanage. And it comes from situations like this where you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners  blindly giving an injection to someone. And the injection is so valuable  that the people basically trust the doctor  being second to God  which I've heard many times  to do the right thing. But in fact they're not. And you can understand  obviously  the transmission problem between people in high virus areas. This video we took undercover  which shows you  over a half an hour period  a tray of medicines of    vials  which are being delivered with only   syringes in a public hospital in India. And over the course of half an hour  not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped. They started with two and they ended with two. And you'll see  just now  a nurse coming back to the tray  which is their sort of modular station  and dropping the syringe she's just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again. So you can imagine the scale of this problem. And in fact in India alone     percent of all injections given are unsafe. These kids in Pakistan don't go to school. They are lucky. They already have a job. And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals  wash them  and in the course of this  obviously picking them up they injure themselves. And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place  which is quite bizarre. In an interesting photo  their father  while we were talking to him  picked up a syringe and pricked his finger    I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end    and immediately whipped out a box of matches  lit one  and burned the blood off the end of his finger  giving me full assurance that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV. In China  recycling is a major issue. And they are collected en mass    you can see the scale of it here    and sorted out  by hand  back into the right sizes  and then put back out on the street. So recycling and reuse are the major issues here. But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia. In all schools in Indonesia  there is usually a toy seller in the playground. The toy seller  in this case  had syringes  which they usually do  next door to the diggers  which is obviously what you would expect. And they use them  in the breaks  for water pistols. They squirt them at each other  which is lovely and innocent. And they are having great fun. But they also drink from them while they're in their breaks  because it's hot. And they squirt the water into their mouths. And these are used with traces of blood visible. So we need a better product. And we need better information. And I think  if I can just borrow this camera  I was going to show you my invention  which I came up with. So  it's a normal looking syringe. You load it up in the normal way. This is made on existing equipment in    factories that we license. You give the injection and then put it down. If someone then tries to reuse it  it locks and breaks afterwards. It's very  very simple. Thank you. And it costs the same as a normal syringe. And in comparison  a Coca Cola is    times the price. And that will stop reusing a syringe    or    times. And I have an information charity which has done huge scale amount of work in India. And we're very proud of giving information to people  so that little kids like this don't do stupid things. Thank you very much. The future  as we know it  is very unpredictable. The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong. This is in technology. This is in the area of politics  where pundits  the CIA  MI  always get it wrong. And it's clearly in the area of finance. With institutions established to think about the future  the IMF  the BIS  the Financial Stability Forum  couldn't see what was coming. Over        economists whose job it is  competitive entry to get there  couldn't see what was happening. Globalization is getting more complex. And this change is getting more rapid. The future will be more unpredictable. Urbanization  integration  coming together  leads to a new renaissance. It did this a thousand years ago. The last    years have been extraordinary times. Life expectancy has gone up by about    years. It took from the Stone Age to achieve that. Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population  despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period. And illiteracy has gone down  from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth. A huge opportunity  unleashing of new potential for innovation  for development. But there is an underbelly. There are two Achilles' heels of globalization. There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality    those that are left out  those that feel angry  those that are not participating. Globalization has not been inclusive. The second Achilles' heel is complexity    a growing fragility  a growing brittleness. What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else. This is a systemic risk  systemic shock. We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu. It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against. A lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology. There have been huge leaps. There will be a million fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in computing by     . That's what the experience of the last    years has been. It will continue. Our computers  our systems will be as primitive as the Apollo's are for today. Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine. Our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of    years ago. So what will this do  It will create huge opportunities in technology. Miniaturization as well. There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies  in our brains  and in the air. This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica. This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential  not least in the area of medicine. This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford  from an embryonic stem cell. We can develop any part of the body. Increasingly  over time  this will be possible from our own skin    able to replicate parts of the body. Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine. I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after       because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body. But the question is   Who will have it   The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics. The capacity to create  as this mouse has been genetically modified  something which goes three times faster  lasts for three times longer  we could produce  as this mouse can  to the age of our equivalent of    years  using about the same amount of food. But will this only be available for the super rich  for those that can afford it  Are we headed for a new eugenics  Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future  So the big question for us is   How do we manage this technological change   How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology  a technology which means that not only as we grow older  that we can also grow wiser  and that we're able to support the populations of the future  One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins. There is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in     . These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West. The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in China and in many other countries. So forget about retirements if you're young. Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going. Of course  migration will become even more important. The war on talent  the need to attract people at all skill ranges  to push us around in our wheelchairs  but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital. The employment in the rich countries will go down from about     to about     million of these people. This would imply a massive leap in migration. So the concerns  the xenophobic concerns of today  of migration  will be turned on their head  as we search for people to help us sort out our pensions and our economies in the future. And then  the systemic risks. We understand that these will become much more virulent  that what we see today is this interweaving of societies  of systems  fastened by technologies and hastened by just in time management systems. Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility. The collapse in biodiversity  climate change  pandemics  financial crises  these will be the currency that we will think about. And so a new awareness will have to arise  of how we deal with these  how we mobilize ourselves  in a new way  and come together as a community to manage systemic risk. It's going to require innovation. It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall. This could be our best century ever because of the achievements  or it could be our worst. And of course we need to worry about the individuals  particularly the individuals that feel that they've been left out in one way or another. An individual  for the first time in the history of humanity  will have the capacity  by       to destroy the planet  to wreck everything  through the creation  for example  of a biopathogen. How do we begin to weave these tapestries together  How do we think about complex systems in new ways  That will be the challenge of the scholars  and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future. The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now. We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized. It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring. We have to develop a new way of managing the planet  collectively  through collective wisdom. We know  and I know from my own experience  that amazing things can happen  when individuals and societies come together to change their future. I left South Africa  and    years later  after thinking I would never go back  I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela. This was a miracle. We can create miracles  collectively  in our lifetime. It is vital that we do so. It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED  that the ideas that we think about look forward  and make sure that this will be the most glorious century  and not one of eco disaster and eco collapse. Thank you.  Applause  I'm sure that  throughout the hundred thousand odd years of our species' existence  and even before  our ancestors looked up at the night sky  and wondered what stars are. Wondering  therefore  how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen. Okay  so  most people only wondered that occasionally  like today  in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them. But what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know. They wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing  and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation  be warmer  cooler  safer  in less pain. I bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better. In every aspect of their lives  they wished for progress  just as we do. But they failed  almost completely  to make any. They didn't know how to. Discoveries like fire happened so rarely  that from an individual's point of view  the world never improved. Nothing new was learned. The first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as       radioactivity. Within    years  physicists discovered the whole explanation  expressed  as usual  in elegant symbols. But never mind the symbols. Think how many discoveries they represent. Nuclei and nuclear reactions  of course. But isotopes  particles of electricity  antimatter  neutrinos  the conversion of mass to energy    that's E mc      gamma rays  transmutation. That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries  and new  unexpected phenomena. That all that  discovered in    years  had not been in the previous hundred thousand  was not for lack of thinking about stars  and all those other urgent problems they had. They even arrived at answers  such as myths  that dominated their lives  yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth. The tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn't sufficiently recognized  I think. These were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things. But that ability to make progress remained almost unused  until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe. Or so we should hope. Because that event was the Scientific Revolution  ever since which our knowledge of the physical world  and of how to adapt it to our wishes  has been growing relentlessly. Now  what had changed  What were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid  open ended discovery  How to make that difference is surely the most important universal truth that it is possible to know. Worryingly  there is no consensus about what it is. So  I'll tell you. But I'll have to backtrack a little first. Before the Scientific Revolution  they believed that everything important  knowable  was already known  enshrined in ancient writings  institutions  and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb    which were  however  entrenched as dogmas  along with many falsehoods. So they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little. And therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of learned men  priests  traditions and rulers. Which is why the Scientific Revolution had to have a wider context. The Enlightenment  a revolution in how people sought knowledge  trying not to rely on authority.  Take no one's word for it.  But that can't be what made the difference. Authorities had been rejected before  many times. And that rarely  if ever  caused anything like the Scientific Revolution. At the time  what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen  known as empiricism. All knowledge derives from the senses. Well  we've seen that that can't be true. It did help by promoting observation and experiment. But  from the outset  it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it. Knowledge comes from the senses. In what language  Certainly not the language of mathematics  in which  Galileo rightly said  the book of nature is written. Look at the world. You don't see equations carved on to the mountainsides. If you did  it would be because people had carved them. By the way  why don't we do that  What's wrong with us  Empiricism is inadequate because  well  scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen. And the unseen  you have to admit  doesn't come to us through the senses. We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars. We don't see the origin of species. We don't see the curvature of space time  and other universes. But we know about those things. How  Well  the classic empiricist answer is induction. The unseen resembles the seen. But it doesn't. You know what the clinching evidence was that space time is curved  It was a photograph  not of space time  but of an eclipse  with a dot there rather than there. And the evidence for evolution  Some rocks and some finches. And parallel universes  Again  dots there  rather than there  on a screen. What we see  in all these cases  bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible    only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them.  Ah   say creationists.  So you admit it's all interpretation. No one has ever seen evolution. We see rocks. You have your interpretation. We have ours. Yours comes from guesswork  ours from the Bible.  But what creationist and empiricists both ignore is that  in that sense  no one has ever seen a bible either  that the eye only detects light  which we don't perceive. Brains only detect nerve impulses. And they don't perceive even those as what they really are  namely electrical crackles. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. Our connection to reality is never just perception. It's always  as Karl Popper put it  theory laden. Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything. It's like all knowledge. It's conjectural  guesswork  tested by observation  not derived from it. So  were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates  No. Contrary to what's usually said  testability is common  in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking. Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday has got a testable prediction. Consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons. Hades  God of the Underworld  kidnaps Persephone  the Goddess of Spring  and negotiates a forced marriage contract  requiring her to return regularly  and lets her go. And each year  she is magically compelled to return. And her mother  Demeter  Goddess of the Earth  is sad  and makes it cold and barren. That myth is testable. If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness  then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously. So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest  they'd have known that their theory is false. So what was wrong with that myth  and with all pre scientific thinking  and what  then  made that momentous difference  I think there is one thing you have to care about. And that implies testability  the scientific method  the Enlightenment  and everything. And here is the crucial thing. There is such a thing as a defect in a story. I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation. What does that mean  Well  explanation is an assertion about what's there  unseen  that accounts for what's seen. Because the explanatory role of Persephone's marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities. Why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual action  Here is one. Persephone wasn't released. She escaped  and returns every spring to take revenge on Hades  with her Spring powers. She cools his domain with Spring air  venting heat up to the surface  creating summer. That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth. It's equally testable. Yet what it asserts about reality is  in many ways  the opposite. And that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons  except via the myth itself. This easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation  because  without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants  advocating one of them  in preference to the others  is irrational. So  for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress  seek good explanations  the ones that can't be easily varied  while still explaining the phenomena. Now  our current explanation of seasons is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that  so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year  and away for the other half. Better put that up. That's a good explanation  hard to vary  because every detail plays a functional role. For instance  we know  independently of seasons  that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat are heated less  and that a spinning sphere  in space  points in a constant direction. And the tilt also explains the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year  and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres. If they'd been observed in phase  the theory would have been refuted. But now  the fact that it's also a good explanation  hard to vary  makes the crucial difference. If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia  they could have easily varied their myth to predict that. For instance  when Demeter is upset  she banishes heat from her vicinity  into the other hemisphere  where it makes summer. So  being proved wrong by observation  and changing their theory accordingly  still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons  because their explanation was bad  easy to vary. And it's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable. If the axis tilt theory had been refuted  its defenders would have had nowhere to go. No easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres. The search for hard to vary explanations is the origin of all progress. It's the basic regulating principle of the Enlightenment. So  in science  two false approaches blight progress. One is well known  untestable theories. But the more important one is explanationless theories. Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue  but you aren't given a hard to vary account of what causes that trend  you're being told a wizard did it. When you are told that carrots have human rights because they share half our genes    but not how gene percentages confer rights    wizard. When someone announces that the nature nurture debate has been settled because there is evidence that a given percentage of our political opinions are genetically inherited  but they don't explain how genes cause opinions  they've settled nothing. They are saying that our opinions are caused by wizards  and presumably so are their own. That the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world. It's a fact that is  itself  unseen  yet impossible to vary. Thank you. All buildings today have something in common. They're made using Victorian technologies. This involves blueprints  industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers. All of this effort results in an inert object. And that means that there is a one way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities. This is not sustainable. I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature  not insulating them from it. Now  in order to do this  we need the right kind of language. Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world  through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism. And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another  either through the production or the absorption of energy. And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way. So  I'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture. But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them. I'm working with architect Neil Spiller at the Bartlett School of Architecture  and we're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach. That means we're generating them from scratch. One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc  and he's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter. Now  that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in  when we're thinking about sustainable materials. So  Martin  he works with a system called the protocell. Now all this is    and it's magic    is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it. And it has no DNA. This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living. It is able to move around its environment. It can follow chemical gradients. It can undergo complex reactions  some of which are happily architectural. So here we are. These are protocells  patterning their environment. We don't know how they do that yet. Here  this is a protocell  and it's vigorously shedding this skin. Now  this looks like a chemical kind of birth. This is a violent process. Here  we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate. And that's the shell around that globular fat. They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there. So what we're trying to do is  we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom up construction approaches for architecture  which contrast the current  Victorian  top down methods which impose structure upon matter. That can't be energetically sensible. So  bottom up materials actually exist today. They've been in use  in architecture  since ancient times. If you walk around the city of Oxford  where we are today  and have a look at the brickwork  which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days  you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone. And if you look even closer  you'll see  in that limestone  there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other. And then they are fossilized over millions of years. Now a block of limestone  in itself  isn't particularly that interesting. It looks beautiful. But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere. Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide. Would it give this block of limestone new properties  Well  most likely it would. It might be able to grow. It might be able to self repair  and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment. So  architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material. They think big. Okay  So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials  we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls  or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water. So  one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice. Now  Venice  as you know  has a tempestuous relationship with the sea  and is built upon wooden piles. So we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice. And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city. So  here is the technology we have today. This is our protocell technology  effectively making a shell  like its limestone forefathers  and depositing it in a very complex environment  against natural materials. We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this. Now  this is the very interesting part. We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals. What we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles. So  you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light  toward the dark foundations. We've observed this in the laboratory. The protocells can actually move away from the light. They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species. So that these don't just exist as one entity  we kind of chemically engineer them. And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically  around the foundations of Venice  effectively petrifying it. Now  this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while. It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case by case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice. But gradually  as the buildings are repaired  we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city. An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide. Also it will attract the local marine ecology  who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture. So  this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way. But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere. This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it  which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries. So  in summary  I'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies  and building architectures from a bottom up approach. Secondly  these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems  which means they can perform in similar ways. They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture. And finally  an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one. Thank you. I'm a writer and a journalist  and I'm also an insanely curious person  so in    years as a journalist  I've learned how to do a lot of new things. And three years ago  one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible. I became one of the working homeless. I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year  and decided to travel. His death hit me pretty hard. And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that. I've camped my whole life. And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip. So I packed my cat  my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a      Chevy van  and drove off into the sunset  having fully failed to realize three critical things. One  that society equates living in a permanent structure  even a shack  with having value as a person. Two  I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality  if we let it. Three  I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude  not a lifestyle. At first  living in the van was great. I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly. And I had time to relax and to grieve. But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in. My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full time job to pay the bills. What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer. And it became impossible to park anywhere       without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me  and it was really hot. The cat came and went through an open window in the van. The doggy went into doggy day care. And I sweated. Whenever I could  I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops. Or I washed up in public rest rooms. Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below    degrees Fahrenheit  making it difficult or impossible to sleep. Food rotted in the heat. Ice in my ice chest melted within hours  and it was pretty miserable. I couldn't afford to find an apartment  or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat. And I refused to give them up  so I stayed in the van. And when the heat made me too sick to walk the    feet to the public restroom outside my van at night  I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet. When winter weather set in  the temperatures dropped below freezing. And they stayed there. And I faced a whole new set of challenges. I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police. I didn't always succeed. But I felt out of control of my life. And I don't know when or how it happened  but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman  living in a van  took my breath away. I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped. My talent  my integrity  my values  everything about me remained the same. But I had changed somehow. I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression. And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic. And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days. I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line. I just wasn't drunk or high. And when several of the homeless men realized that  including a former university professor  they said   You aren't homeless. Why are you really here   Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless  but I did. Then the professor listened to my story and he said   You have a job. You have hope. The real homeless don't have hope.  A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal. And I remember thinking   If I killed myself  no one would notice.  A friend told me  shortly after that  that she had heard that Tim Russert  a nationally renowned journalist  had been talking about me on national T.V. An essay I'd written about my father  the year before he died  was in Tim's new book. And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing. And when I realized that Tim Russert  former moderator of  Meet the Press   was talking about my writing  while I was living in a van in a Wal Mart parking lot  I started laughing. You should too. I started laughing because it got to the point where  was I a writer  or was I a homeless woman  So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book. And I stood there. And I reread my essay. And I cried. Because I was a writer. I was a writer. Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee. I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends. And I started writing again. By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist. I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment. I was no longer homeless. And I was no longer invisible. Thousands of people work full and part time jobs  and live in their cars. But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets. So the homeless  the working homeless  primarily remain invisible. But if you ever meet one  engage them  encourage them  and offer them hope. The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope. And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless. I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet. But I am here to tell you that  based on my experience  people are not where they live  where they sleep  or what their life situation is at any given time. Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal Mart parking lot  and today I'm speaking at TED. Hope always  always finds a way. Thank you. On the   th of May        a gunshot was heard ringing out across the   th arrondissement in Paris. A peasant  who was walking to market that morning  ran towards where the gunshot had come from  and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor  clearly shot by a dueling wound. The young man's name was Evariste Galois. He was a well known revolutionary in Paris at the time. Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother. And the last words he said to his brother were   Don't cry for me  Alfred. I need all the courage I can muster to die at the age of   .  It wasn't  in fact  revolutionary politics for which Galois was famous. But a few years earlier  while still at school  he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time. And he wrote to the academicians in Paris  trying to explain his theory. But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote. This is how he wrote most of his mathematics. So  the night before that duel  he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough. So he stayed up the whole night  writing away  trying to explain his ideas. And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny  he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation. Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed. But contained inside those documents was a new language  a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science    namely symmetry. Now  symmetry is almost nature's language. It helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world. For example  molecular structure. What crystals are possible  we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry. In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object  because they are generally rather nasty. The swine flu virus  at the moment  is a symmetrical object. And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well. But on a larger scale of biology  actually symmetry is very important  because it actually communicates genetic information. I've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical. And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful  you're probably drawn to the lower two. Because it is hard to make symmetry. And if you can make yourself symmetrical  you're sending out a sign that you've got good genes  you've got a good upbringing and therefore you'll make a good mate. So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate genetic information. Symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there  it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space. And I think Galileo summed up  very nicely  the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us. He wrote   The universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language  and the letters are triangles  circles and other geometric figures  without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word.  But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry. Artists too love to play around with symmetry. They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it. Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in  The Magic Mountain.  He has a character describing the snowflake  and he says he  shuddered at its perfect precision  found it deathly  the very marrow of death.  But what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them. And a beautiful example of this I found  actually  when I visited a colleague of mine in Japan  Professor Kurokawa. And he took me up to the temples in Nikko. And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs. And the gateway you see behind has eight columns  with beautiful symmetrical designs on them. Seven of them are exactly the same  and the eighth one is turned upside down. And I said to Professor Kurokawa   Wow  the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down.  And he said   No  no  no. It was a very deliberate act.  And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese  Essays in Idleness  from the   th century  in which the essayist wrote   In everything  uniformity is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting  and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.  Even when building the Imperial Palace  they always leave one place unfinished. But if I had to choose one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island  to live the rest of my life  being an addict of symmetry  I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada. This is a palace celebrating symmetry. Recently I took my family    we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips  which my family love. This is my son Tamer. You can see he's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra. But I wanted to try and enrich him. I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in. So  I wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra. You see it already. Immediately you go in  the reflective symmetry in the water. But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening. The Moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls. So they explored a more geometric art. And so what is symmetry  The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions. What is symmetry  When  there  are two of these walls  do they have the same symmetries  Can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the Alhambra  And it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions. For Galois  symmetry    unlike for Thomas Mann  which was something still and deathly    for Galois  symmetry was all about motion. What can you do to a symmetrical object  move it in some way  so it looks the same as before you moved it  I like to describe it as the magic trick moves. What can you do to something  You close your eyes. I do something  put it back down again. It looks like it did before it started. So  for example  the walls in the Alhambra    I can take all of these tiles  and fix them at the yellow place  rotate them by    degrees  put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there. And if you open your eyes again  you wouldn't know that they'd moved. But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the Alhambra. But it's also about producing a language to describe this. And the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another  to change geometry into language. So I'm going to take you through  perhaps push you a little bit mathematically    so brace yourselves    push you a little bit to understand how this language works  which enables us to capture what is symmetry. So  let's take these two symmetrical objects here. Let's take the twisted six pointed starfish. What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same  Well  there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn  and still it looks like it did before I started. I could rotate it by a third of a turn  or a half a turn  or put it back down on its image  or two thirds of a turn. And a fifth symmetry  I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn. And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started. Now  for Galois  there was actually a sixth symmetry. Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started  I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it  haven't I  It's got no reflective symmetry. But what I could do is just leave it where it is  pick it up  and put it down again. And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry. Actually  the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept  seventh century A.D.  by the Indians. It seems mad to talk about nothing. And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical    so everything has symmetry  where you just leave it where it is. So  this object has six symmetries. And what about the triangle  Well  I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise. But now this has some reflectional symmetry. I can reflect it in the line through X  or the line through Y  or the line through Z. Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where I just pick it up and leave it where it is. So both of these objects have six symmetries. Now  I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport  and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it. So here is a little question for you. And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer. The Rubik's Cube. How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have  How many things can I do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube  Okay  So I want you to think about that problem as we go on  and count how many symmetries there are. And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end. But let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects. What Galois realized  it isn't just the individual symmetries  but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object. If I do one magic trick move followed by another  the combination is a third magic trick move. And here we see Galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen  the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object. For example  what if I turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn  and then a third of a turn  So I've given names. The capital letters  A  B  C  D  E  F  are the names for the rotations. B  for example  rotates the little yellow dot to the B on the starfish. And so on. So what if I do B  which is a sixth of a turn  followed by C  which is a third of a turn  Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn  followed by a third of a turn  the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go. So the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work. I do one followed by another  the answer is it's rotation D  half a turn. What I if I did it in the other order  Would it make any difference  Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first  and then the sixth of a turn. Of course  it doesn't make any difference. It still ends up at half a turn. And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other. But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle. Let's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle  one after the other. Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise  and reflect in the line through X. Well  the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with. Now  let's do it in a different order. Let's do the reflection in X first  followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise. The combined effect  the triangle ends up somewhere completely different. It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y. Now it matters what order you do the operations in. And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects    they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries  But the way the symmetries interact enable us    we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different. And you can try this when you go down to the pub  later on. Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn  then flip it. And then do it in the other order  and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction. Now  Galois produced some laws for how these tables    how symmetries interact. It's almost like little Sudoku tables. You don't see any symmetry twice in any row or column. And  using those rules  he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries. And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle  or the symmetries of the six pointed starfish. I think this is an amazing development. It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry. In the front here  I've got one  two  three people sitting on one  two  three chairs. The people and the chairs are very different  but the number  the abstract idea of the number  is the same. And we can see this now  we go back to the walls in the Alhambra. Here are two very different walls  very different geometric pictures. But  using the language of Galois  we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same. For example  let's take this beautiful wall with the triangles with a little twist on them. You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors. But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet. What about the center of a triangle  I can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle  and everything matches up. And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge  where I can rotate by     degrees. And all the tiles match up again. So rotate along halfway along the edge  and they all match up. Now  let's move to the very different looking wall in the Alhambra. And we find the same symmetries here  and the same interaction. So  there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet. And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars. And although these walls look very different  Galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same. And it's a symmetry we call      . Here is another example in the Alhambra. This is a wall  a ceiling  and a floor. They all look very different. But this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object  which we call      . Nothing to do with football  but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn  and one by half a turn. Now  this power of the language is even more  because Galois can say   Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries on the walls in the Alhambra   And it turns out they almost did. You can prove  using Galois' language  there are actually only    different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra. And they  if you try to produce a different wall with this   th one  it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these   . But these are things that we can see. And the power of Galois' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects in the unseen world  beyond the two dimensional  three dimensional  all the way through to the four  or five  or infinite dimensional space. And that's where I work. I create mathematical objects  symmetrical objects  using Galois' language  in very high dimensional spaces. So I think it's a great example of things unseen  which the power of mathematical language allows you to create. So  like Galois  I stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you  and I've got a picture of it here. Well  unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board at the side here  great  excellent. Here we are. Unfortunately  I can't show you a picture of this symmetrical object. But here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact. Now  this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet. Now  people like getting their names on things  on craters on the moon or new species of animals. So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn't been named before. And this thing    species die away  and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode    but this mathematical object will live forever. It will make you immortal. In order to win this symmetrical object  what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning. How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have  Okay  I'm going to sort you out. Rather than you all shouting out  I want you to count how many digits there are in that number. Okay  If you've got it as a factorial  you've got to expand the factorials. Okay  now if you want to play  I want you to stand up  okay  If you think you've got an estimate for how many digits  right    we've already got one competitor here. If you all stay down he wins it automatically. Okay. Excellent. So we've got four here  five  six. Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right. Anybody with five or less digits  you've got to sit down  because you've underestimated. Five or less digits. So  if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.    digits or more  you've got to sit down. You've overestimated.    digits or less  sit down. How many digits are there in your number  Two  So you should have sat down earlier. Let's have the other ones  who sat down during the     up again. Okay  If I told you    or less  stand up. Because this one. I think there were a few here. The people who just last sat down. Okay  how many digits do you have in your number    . Okay good. How many do you have in yours    . So it goes to this lady here.    is the closest. It actually has    the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube has    digits. So now I need to name this object. So  what is your name  I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally    spell it for me. G H E Z No  SO  has already been used  actually  in the mathematical language. So you can't have that one. So Ghez  there we go. That's your new symmetrical object. You are now immortal. And if you'd like your own symmetrical object  I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala  where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you  for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala. And I think what drives me  as a mathematician  are those things which are not seen  the things that we haven't discovered. It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject. And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese  Essays in Idleness    In everything  uniformity is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting  and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.  Thank you.
